'A huge reason for Teslas insane valuation is the fact that Tesla has amassed 3 billion miles of realworld Autopilot data by comparison Waymo only has 20 million realworld miles and 10 billion simulation miles This allows Tesla to be the only automotive company currently that can train visionbased selfdriving system in the real world at such a huge scale Essentially Tesla is utilizing its users as free labor to train its selfdriving system by having the users correct the system whenever it makes a wrong turn\\n\\nBlackberry IVY will very soon change the game By creating a standard data abstraction layer on the 175 million QNXpowered vehicles and possibly more since IVY is OSagnostic and will support other nonQNX vehicles Blackberry IVY will likely become the defacto industry standard for automakers to share normalized sensor data camera radar lidar steering wheel rotation brakes acceleration etc with Autonomous Vehicle software makers Waymo Cruise Argo Motional Aurora TuSimple Baidu PonyAI Momenta etc\\n\\nBy sharing I mean monetizing Deidentified vehicle sensor and localization data will be the most important asset that automakers can monetize in the immediate short term Blackberry and AWS will be the bridge between the traditional automotive world and the software world by creating programming standards interface and data marketplaces\\n\\nJust imagine this Tesla only has lt2 million vehicles on the road currently and they are already called a Big Data company and worldleading selfdriving car company debatable I personally think anything under L4 autonomy is ADAS not selfdriving \\n\\nImagine what Blackberry IVY can help the automakers and AV software makers achieve with normalized data from gt175 million vehicles Blackberry IVY will provide a standardized safe and secure way for AV software makers to tighten the training feedback loop between users and their software as well as validate their systems in realworld scenarios at a much larger scale than Tesla This will save these AV companies a lot of money from operating their own test vehicle fleets in various locations across the world\\n \\nWith the threat of Tesla coming to eat traditional automakers lunches Blackberry IVY will likely create FearOfMissingOuts FOMOs among traditional automakers to adopt IVY as a musthave enterprise software The industrys transition to EVs will inevitably make any competitive advantage developed around combustion engines and mechanical drivetrain obsolete Software will become a key differentiator for cars in the near future especially cloudconnected vehicle datadriven products that improves battery performance ride quality infotainment autonomous driving Any forwardlooking automaker both ICE and EV should already be looking to devote significant amount of their resources into improving their software offerings or risk getting wiped out in the next industry upheaval led by Tesla Getting better tooling and software infrastructure like Blackberry IVY is their first step\\n\\nIVY will very likely be an easy upsell for existing AWS Automotive customers like Toyota BMW VW to further enhance their cloudbased enterprise workflows and product development lifecycle etc Both Blackberry and AWS  have been their trusted technology partners for a very long time and there is no major conflict of interest
