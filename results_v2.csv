0,SENS Senseonics still very undervalued. An update to my fellow Apes.,14,1.0,HodorNoMoreHodoring,"SENS. Senseonics.

I posted this, this morning but the mods or the bot mods removed my post. So I'm posting again because freedom of speech!

Hi guys. Just wanted to update everyone as yesterday we smashed through resistance again. We now have a higher floor and higher ceiling. We hit $5.50 in after hours and are currently at $5.59 in the pre market. I believe we can see $7 today and $10 this or next week. In my opinion anything under $10 is a discount right now as fda approval is imminent. Holding this thing at $10 as we wait for the 180 day sensor seems fair value to me as it can skyrocket to $20-$40 after the approval. I see this stock at being somewhere around $40-$50 by end of year. Possibly $100 if everything goes right. Below is the info from my last post. It is not too late to jump in on SENS as in my opinion it is still undervalued. If you are looking for a good entry point I would buy some now and if it dips buy more. I don't see it dipping below $4.60 as that would be a heavy level of resistance. However we could see $7 before we ever see $4 again.

Their product is better than everything on the market and extremely price competitive. they have a 90 say sensor implant for diabetes patients out now. Their competitors only have a 15 day sensor and costs like 3 times as much. health insurance covers the eversense sensor by senseonics. they have a 180 day sensor about to be approved by the fda and a 360 day sensor both of which are available in europe right now. Their competitors dexcom has a 38 billion market cap and right now SENS has a 1 billion market cap. SENS is currently trading at $3.80 and will hit $10 soon. It could easily 10x in the next year and take over the market. SENS to the moon 💎 👊 🦧 💪 together!

Here is some more DD from u/whodisdani

Alright guys, sorry for the late reply I gave my very best as I do this one of the first times ... maybe I am approaching this wrongly or interpreting this wrongly.

reporting back from my research: first of all I am not an accountant / economics student (I am an software engineering student who had a little bit of accounting, gave my very best to analyse the stuff) maybe if someone could double check (will link the infos and datasources):

the company made -94 millions in the last year, hence quite a bit away of being break even. In 2020 in comparison to their previous years their revenue operating revenue fell over 50%. This seems to be a covid related issue. In the last two quarters of 2020 they had some income, however, still far from profitable.

​

I tried to break this down into this new 180 day device thing you mentioned, since I had no idea what this is, I went reading into this.

So I created the following calculation (I may be completely off, if so, say this pls): SENS reported that with their new alliance with Ascenia, they will be able to launch the product in Europe. With their operation revenues of 10'016'000 they have approximately 101'000 customers (based on a product price of 99.-). If they are able to expand again (as they did over the last few years) their operating revenue in the US would look something like this (I took the quarterly data, removed the huge spikes and this gave me something of a growth rate like this)

:

Q1 2021 Q2 2021 Q3 2021 Q4 2021 11'531'000 13'087'000 14'853'000 16'857'000 This would lead to an increase in market share of SENS from 0.3% to 0.5%.

Calculation market share SENS:

Country Diabetes Product cost Operating revenue Customers Market share USA 12.2020 30'000'000 99 10'016'000 101'000 0.3% USA 12.2021 30'000'000 99 16'857'000 170'000 0.5%​

I tried to consider the expansion into the European countries as well, with the same market share as in the US.

​

Country Diabetes Product cost Operating revenue Customers Market share Switzerland 500'000 99 250'000 2'500 0.5% Germany 9'500'000 99 4'700'000 47'500 0.5% Italy 3'300'000 99 1'630'000 16'500 0.5% Netherland 1'300'000 99 640'000 6'500 0.5% Poland 2'300'000 99 1'130'000 11'500 0.5% Spain 3'600'000 99 1'780'000 18'000 0.5%​

With this kind of growth, the operating revenue would nearly triple from this year to the end of next year. However, I have no idea if I have done stuff correctly, nor does this have any scientific value. As I said, I did not study anything related to stocks.

2,$STMP Earnings Pullback,16,0.94,GMEguru,"For those of you not aware, [stamps.com](https://stamps.com) $STMP reported earnings afterhours today and absolutely shattered estimates yet the share price dipped as much as 14.8% in afterhours.

EPS of $4.13 compared to $2.62 estimate and $2.12 for the same period last year

Quarterly sales of $206 million compared to $194.26 million expected and compared to $160.9 million for the same period last year

I'm adding a little to my position, as I can easily see this rebounding quickly.

**Edit:**  It seems part of the pullback may be due to no guidance given for 2021 and expected operating expenses increasing by 20% or more in 2021 as they continue investing in global technology platforms

3,$TDC (Teradata) is headed To Da Cosmos. mini DD for turn-around play.,16,0.87,eddardbeer,"$TDC recently announced in their last earnings (February 3rd) that they are not an old boomer tech corp. They are now a boomer tech corp + a high growth, cloud native data-warehousing as as service company. CEO Steve McMillan decided to break out a new metric on the earnings call... cloud-based annual recurring revenues. This was the first mention of this metric and their success in the cloud. It shocked longs and shorts alike.

It sent the stock up from $27.50 to $53. It has since had a healthy pull-back with good support around $45. Here's why I think now is a great entry point:

* Recurring revenue for subscriptions on the public cloud hit $106m, **up 165%** from $40m a year earlier. 
* For the full year of 2021, public cloud ARR is expected to increase by **at least 100% year-over-year**. I.e.) greater than $212M cloud-based ARR by next year.
* If Teradata were new to the market, and had zero other business outside of it's cloud business, it's current growth and revenue would lead us to value it like a growth stock. Let's take a look at those valuations for related businesses: SNOW (170x), MDB (43x), FSLY (50x), DDOG (60x)
* If we took a conservative 50x then Teradata's cloud product alone would value the company at \~$5.3B. (The current stock price gives it a market cap of \~$5B). But obviously the $5.3B figure doesn't even consider the rest of their business... which makes up for 94% of revenue and allows them to stay profitable while they transition heavily into a cloud-first offering.

If their business was valued at \~$2.5B before this news about their successful transition into a subscription/service based company, and their current cloud business should be valued somewhere in the ballpark between $4.5B and $10B based on comparative valuations, then I think $7.5B is an accurate valuation.

Right now they're suffering from the entirety of their company being looked at as a value stock. In reality, it should be looked at as 2 things. A value boomer tech stock \*AND\* a high growth cloud native company. Put those two things together, then you have a fair value of around $70-75, and it could jump higher if their cloud services get valued anywhere close to Snowflake.

tl:dr;

$TDC to $70 or higher within a couple weeks as tutes start to readjust their valuations. I hold shares and 3/19 $50C. This definitely isn't financial advice. I really like this stock. Seems to be incorrectly, or at least inconsistently valued and I think that will come to light over the next couple weeks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm6i4g/tdc_teradata_is_headed_to_da_cosmos_mini_dd_for/,1613629633.0
4,PLTR the next FB? YOLO EITHER WAY,56,0.88,Theeliteshitposter,"YOLO PLTR NOW DD (updated)

Updating my thoughts on PLTR from earlier this afternoon, but I just wanted to share an interesting case study from Facebook’s IPO back in 2012:

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/id/49824482

TLDR: FB and PLTR have many similarities in that they are cutting edge companies that disrupted the entire tech industry. The similarities are eerie: FB had a bearish lock-up period, just like PLTR.

Now, FB was off 40% from its IPO as the lockup approached (PLTR is up triple), nevertheless, there is much skeptism with PLTR as there was with FB in 2012.

People wondered whether FB would be able to transition from PC to mobile... the Street questions if Palantir can secure a stable corporate client base. There’s worries about the lock-up expiration with PLTR, just like with FB in 2013 (see the link).

But here’s the whopper: I don’t believe this lock-up will be nearly as bad as “smart money” speculates. Sure, certain directors @PLTR might sell some, but why would they kill it all now? There’s too much potential.

Cathie Wood reaffirmed her support forholding this bad boy for 5 years by DOUBLING her stake yesterday. You’re a fool if you think Alex Karp and Peter Thiel are thinking much differently.

This negativity is overblown. Perhaps we see $25 on PLTR, but think: how much lower can we go? We are stuck at a $50B valuation right now, compared to $80B for boomer-based Snowfuck ($SNOW). 

And if you feel queasy or unsure, just ask yourself: who does what PLTR does? A mega, all-seeing, AI mastermind that can solve problems across defense, technology, financials, and energy? 

Certainly ain’t POS C3.AI or Spermflake. By the way- those other names are wayyyy more *overvalued* than King Palantir.

So I’m personally doubling down and buying more shares/calls tomorrow. This is simply the greatest firesale engineered on a looming corporate giant in financial history, and we retail investors & enthusiasts are chumps if we sit this one out.

POSITIONS (very highly requested): https://imgur.com/gallery/pldEQsP

———————————————

BUY BUY BUY

Reload, double down, do it all!

This is the firesale of a lifetime on the next Google/Facebook. On days like today, you BUY PLTR with a take-no-prisoners attitude. 

Considering Cathie Wood doubled her PLTR stake yesterday, I don’t feel too fucked in the head.

Reloading on shares and $40 calls, and if this corrects to $25, Wall Street will be asking me to do some pretty ridiculous DCAG trades.

5,"$PLUG Power is Extremely Oversold, Here’s Why",24,0.84,kirlandwater,"$PLUG is current trading down ~25% from last months ATH of $75.49 to about $56 at the time of this writing, despite a strong forward outlook and many huge news releases/partnerships announced in the last couple of months. This is why I believe $PLUG has been consolidating and is currently massively undervalued.

**Purchase Orders & Partnerships with Walmart & Amazon**
$PLUG’s largest single customers are currently the retail & e-commerce behemoths, Walmart and Amazon. Both companies utilizing their hydrogen fuel cell packs and refueling stations to power light commercial vehicles in stores/distribution centers (think forklifts and the like for LTC vehicles). These are both huge name customers throwing their weight behind Plug Power with no indication of switching away from their products, but will continue to need more as they respectively, continue to grow.

**SK Group/Renault/Acciona S.A Partnership Announcements**

These three major announcements push Plug’s offerings beyond U.S borders opening up revenue from hundreds of millions of potential consumers, both civilian and corporate customers. Clean Hydrogen as a major energy source in SK, hydrogen power LTCV and mass market consumer vehicles with Renault in EU, and reaching Spain’s goal of 100% clean energy in only 9 years by 2030 with Acciona S.A.

**Plug Power Appoints new Chief Marketing Officer from primary competitor, Bloom Energy.**

**Biden-Harris LOVE clean energy**

Its no secret the current administration is funneling a metric fuck load of money toward Green/Clean energy. Including [targeting low-cost hydrogen production within their newly launched Climate Innovation Working Group](https://www.ir.plugpower.com/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Details/2021/Plug-Power-Announces-Preeti-Pande-as-New-Chief-Marketing-Officer/default.aspx). This coupled with the [US Department of Energy’s $100 million in funding to further R&D clean energy initiatives via the Advanced Research Projects Agency- Energy’s (ARPA-E) OPEN 2021 program.](https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-announces-100-million-transformative-clean-energy-solutions-supporting). Hydrogen is extremely clean and will only get more and more efficient with time.

**Major Institutional Investor Backing**

**Ok, so why did it crash this week?**

“Some fucking country in Europe took a shit [(Norway)](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-u.s.-fuel-cell-stocks-are-crashing-2021-02-17), Let them do what they want to fucking do. Our market’s solid.”
Norway is opening some hydrogen facility to expand their energy dependent economy. All of their exports are oil, now they want to dip their toes in hydrogen. Norway is tiny, and really a non-issue imo. Their primary focus is still oil, natural gas, and fish lmao. Long term this could be good as the region becomes more accepting of hydrogen and Plug Power, as the current clear leader in the space, can wiggle in for a piece of the pie. $BE & $FCEL are also sliding down, though this appears to be slowing down, primed for a sharp reversal.

TL;DR: Hydrogen is a key part of the global transition to green/clean energy. Will it outshine EV/ICE cars? Fuck no, but it doesn’t need to make a metric fuck ton of money. $PLUG is the clear leader in the hydrogen space, and their lead will continue to grow.

Disclosure: This is not financial advice. This is my DD that I am choosing to share to simply spark a conversation and share my own personal thoughts for others to poke a hole in in case I overlook something. I am long $PLUG via 1k shares and given today’s market slide, should it continue, I’ll be converting some of my holdings to LEAPS dating Jan 2023.

**What does all that mean?**

There is demand. There is cash with more cash coming from the government. There is celebrity investors pushing their products with skin in the game.

**Is this company real? Nikola did bad things.**

Nikola scared a lot of you from these SPACs claiming EV offerings. I don't know why anyone believed in them when they had nothing from near day 1.

But Lordstown is differnent. Lordstown has a [$6 billion plant sold to them from GM for peanuts](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/business/gm-lordstown-plant-sale-electric-pickup/index.html), a town full of skilled workers eager to work, and partnering companies like [LG CHEM setting up shop next door](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/business/gm-lg-battery-plant-lordstown/index.html) to them to deliver batteries. Lordstown is real.

**Something about crayons.**

I found this chart on [Tradingview](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/RIDE/R36RkOqU-RIDE-RDY-TO-BOUNCE/). Do what you will with it.

I will say that RIDE usually trades with WKHS. WKHS is now at (02/17/2020) at $32.43 while RIDE is at $24.74. The above chart suggests an imminent breakout.

**What makes them different**

Their biggest angle is fleet focused solutions. These trucks are meant to address fleet problems. Secondly, they offer a hub motor solution. That means the motor is behind the rim of each wheel, giving the vehicle an all wheel drive versatility, and reducing the cost of maintenance. Why? Because if one motor goes bad, you just remove it and replace it. It's easy access and smaller (less cost).

**Anything else besides a truck?**

Two other vehicles are being discussed. One, a [commercial van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) and the other, an electric RV (see tweets above).

**What does your crystal ball tell you?**

Absolutely nothing. It's a dud. My gut, however, tells me RIDE is ready to pop. Too much money is in this and the company uses actual electric powered motors, and not the gravitation powered ones made famous by Nikola.

**Catalysts**

March will see [57 beta vehicles produced](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-start-building-beta-prototypes-of-endurance-pickup/). These will be used for crash tests and such, but more importantly, be sent to initial fleet customers for feedback.

April - ??? The Department of Energy will decide on the loan. I[t helps when you have a huge cheerleader in office (Tim Ryan).](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/lordstown-motors-is-riding-on-hopes-with-biden-and-ryan/ar-BB1dmEBd)

Some time this year we'll see the EV RV and Van designs/concepts.

September The beginning of live production.

**Price targets**

Using GM forward P/E and 4% margins on revenue, this stock will range between $33 and $198. The $198 assumes full capacity of 600,000 vehicles sold. $33 assumes the 100,000 vehicles sold yearly. I'm comfortable with $115 - $125.

FDA officials will then review the   submitted data, compile a report, and submit the report to an   independent vaccine advisory committee. The committee will then meet on   February 26 and make their recommendation, which means that the FDA   could decide on a EUA by the end of February.""

I know what you’re thinking “XRX, a dated and otherwise antiquated printing company that’s sold at Office Max to boomers”. Let me explain why that is no longer and will no longer be their company or business model. This also is not a “TeSlA iS NoT a Car COmpAny”... they are very much still and will remain an office supplies and office infrastructure company. It’s more an evolution regarding execution and forward thinking implementations coupled with strong management that’s been time tested.

Xerox installed its first 3D printer for a client in December, and IoT solutions are at work with the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and other clients.”

And then let’s use PRNT by Ark Investments as a canvas for observing 3-D printing, and IoT printing as a future prospect. Also, PRNT gives us an idea of the market's “readiness” for pricing these assets.

It’s clear that we are dealing with a company that is primed and ready to make a claim on the 3-D printing, and IoT for office. Given their infrastructure already in place from being a legacy brand with legacy clients... I firmly believe they will capitalize on the market.

Lastly, and this is the kicker, Carl Ichan has recently up’d his stake in the company. He is building a long position and I frankly have no problem riding with him.

9,Nektar (NKTR): Short Squeeze Candidate with Long Term Fundamental Value,10,0.61,raddaddio,"I actually tried to post this last week, but the spam filters took it down. I am reposting it because we have confirmation today with a 10% move up, hopefully it posts this time because there is still a lot of room in this stock.

Summary:

* NKTR has recently broken out of long-term consolidation at its lows with bullish daily price action.
* With 24 million shares sold short and 98% owned by institutions, there are very few shares available to be bought in the market. Hedge funds who are short this stock will be quickly underwater if this short squeeze gains steam. Given the recent highly visible short squeezes, there will be a rush toward the exits for hedge funds as the squeeze gains momentum.
* While NKTR will not make money until one of its many drug candidates reach the market, it has zero debt and $1B in cash. The company is in a strong financial position and its blockbuster drug for melanoma (Bempegaldesleukin) is in final Phase 3 trials. At a $3.5B market cap it is currently extremely undervalued.

NKTR has recently broken out of long-term consolidation:

[ As you can see by the daily chart, NKTR has recently climbed above its long term moving averages on convincing price action. The last time this happened in 2017, the stock quickly ran up to 100. ](https://preview.redd.it/c8y9b7ibz2i61.png?width=2709&format=png&auto=webp&s=db9baeba43b81d20c367a490bb3edbac3713615b)

 Hedge funds who are short this stock will be quickly underwater if this short squeeze gains steam. 

[ Looking at the 5 minute chart for the past 2 weeks, we can see that NKTR broke out on 1\/25 and there was some quick short covering in the wake of the publicity around GME and short targeting. The hedge funds did manage to keep the stock under 25 that first week and prevent a gamma squeeze. The stock is now flirting with closing over 25 with today's move. If it does, the short squeeze will quickly gain momentum and 100+ is a very reasonable price target](https://preview.redd.it/oiz51c2jz2i61.png?width=2030&format=png&auto=webp&s=09e8189f045fffd444c63c6f84410da6d56f364d)

NKTR is in a strong financial position and its blockbuster drug for melanoma (Bempegaldesleukin) is in final Phase 3 trials.

The data regarding Bempegaldesleukin is too dense to discuss here completely but just to give a few numbers, the most recent update in November 2020 saw a 53% overall response rate and 34% complete response rate at 18 months for melanoma. This is an amazing result!

As melanoma is one of the world’s most common cancers, the drug has all the makings of a blockbuster. Even ignoring the immediate short squeeze opportunity, NKTR is extremely undervalued based on this alone and is a very viable long-term investment candidate.

In addition to Bempeg, there are several other drugs in the pipeline for indications including Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, Atopic Dermatitis, and autoimmune diseases such as Ulcerative Colitis and Lupus. Any number of these drugs could be blockbusters in their own right as these are all also very common diseases. The NKTR pipeline is one of the most potentially lucrative pipelines in all of biotech.

In summary, there is an immediate short squeeze trade opportunity in NKTR as well as a longer term investment play.

I welcome any thoughts!

Hello ape! 🦍 Come closer don't be afraid... Have you been anally violated in the great BANG war??($BB,AMC,NOK,GME) Did Melvin and his bros steal tendies from you? Are you desperately looking for another play after being violated in all the wrong places???

$aaaAYTU am looking for the next play after getting fucked with my $GME position!

**Background: When $BB was undervalued, I wrote a good** [**DD(click me)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kb6exy/the_fallen_berry_will_be_reincarnated_as_a_bb/) **preMoon Launch and made the Forest grump meme! So, I hope this gives me some Retard street credits!**

**A retard like you will go directly to the TLDR,** but a normal person might ask, What is $aaaAYTU? aaaAytu BioScience is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel treatments by acquiring or licensing approved, commercialized products and late-stage development therapeutics. They bring these novel and needed treatments to the market of millions of patients who desperately need them. **In Ape language(plagiarized):** It is an unconventional biotech company, which acquires licenses for new drugs/tech they think will massively disrupt the medical sector and they help bring these products to the market.

An example of what they have right now: **COVID-19** lgG/lgM Rapid Test, **NATESTO**(nasal gel, the only FDA-approved nasally administered testosterone indicated for replacement therapy in adult males with a deficiency), **ZOLPIMIST**(DA-approved oral spray zolpidem product indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep initiation.), **KARBINAL**(indicated to treat various allergic conditions including seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, and other common allergic conditions.), **TUZISTRA**(is the only codeine-based extended-release oral suspension cough-cold treatment in the US prescription cough-cold market.), and others you can check out later.

**(** 🚀 **massive catalyst** 🚀 **) A novel treatment they are working on** which they accidentally stumbled on, like most scientific innovations. The treatment is using UV light as an antimicrobial(against viruses and bacteria) therapy in humans. Moreover, Orange man has mentioned using UV light to treat COVID patients a few months back. It's potentially a safe and effective approach of treating internal organs by using UV light against Microbes. **(How it works)** UV light kills viruses(such as COVID) and bacteria, but it's harmful to humans. they got around that by filtering the UV light from UVB(dangerous) and using only UVA(safe). They plan to insert it to the body through an endotracheal tube(throat tube) which has an LED emitter. If it gets an FDA approval, it would be ground breaking.

**Recent news?** a few days ago, they had their first earnings of the year and they beat revenue expectations BY **2.9$Million!!! with lots of spare cash.** In addition, they announced that soon they will merge with $NEOS(100M revenue).

Now you might wonder, with all of what I mentioned, this must be a billion dollar company right? Wrong!!!! it shockingly has a market cap of **only 147million!!!** making it **massively undervalued** in my opinion.

**TLDR:**

**1- Massively undervalued stock. (this is an understatement) ✅**

**2- It has a great product line with a massive cash reserve. ✅**

**3- It's working on a new type of treatment which could disrupt the industry. ✅**

**4- It does not have options. (MM's will not fuck with the price on a weekly basis to steal premiums) ✅**

11,"GME - EndGame part 6: The Big Reset, or The Greatest Financial Crime of the Century - and how to play GME going forward",5400,0.96,FatAspirations," 

This is an extension of my DD series on GME. I have been investing in, learning about, and following GME since September 2020, and in that time I have learned many things. It is also likely my last post on GME for a while as I find myself repeating key points, and others are doing excellent DD on GME in the meantime.

In this post, I’ll share as much understanding as I can about how we got here, about shorts, and my thoughts on the future of GME. I’ll also try to include many tips around trading/investing with GME going forward. 

**TL;DR:** The squeeze has been reset. Shorts have re-set their short positions at much higher sell points, and longs have likely cycled through. I don’t believe a VW-style squeeze is possible because Robinhood will just get choked again, but I do believe $GME is worth much more than $50/share. Fuck “diamond handing”, I’m **starting to accumulate shares again.** I share below how I’m trading GME.

# Important External Reading

These three non-reddit articles are critical for understanding the short playbook. This is essential reading if you want to understand how the funds that are short GME may have manipulated/directed the DTCC to strong-arm Robinhood to halt buying on the 28th. My key takeaway from all this is that the core investigation needs to be happening with the **DTCC/NSCC** to understand why the margin changes were forced upon RobinHood, and who specifically asked for the buying halt on the 28th. I believe shorts worked together with brokerages and the DTCC to rob investors of over $40B of value, representing what is probably one of **the greatest financial crimes of the century.**

   * “Who controls the DTCC? **The answer is that the banks and brokers who use DTCC‘s services, who process trades there, who fail to deliver there, are insiders who sit on the DTCC Board of Directors.”**

# History of shares and shorts on $GME

Here’s some history on GME that’s worth knowing so you understand the context of where we are today. 

* **GME used to have many, many more shares outstanding.** Back in 2009, there were over 160M shares outstanding, and GME has steadily been reducing the number of shares outstanding through buybacks and share retirements, concluding with a **massive share 40% buyback in 2019** pushing GME under 70M outstanding shares. 

&#x200B;

[When you look at a price history chart, you need to factor this in. So when GME’s share price was $50 in 2008, its market cap was actually $8B not $4B like it is today at $50\/share. ](https://preview.redd.it/ejtu6zwpw2i61.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=39251744113f8248a9b8290193d0df5e7436ae2a)

* **GME used to be in the S&P 500.** It was added in December 2007 when it had around an $8B market cap and removed in April 2016 when its market cap had dropped to around $3B. In 2016, there were about 25M+ shares shorted of GME. **It’s very likely GME was shorted out of the S&P.** 
* **Short interest did not decrease after share buybacks.** In 2019, GME bought back and retired 40% of their shares yet amazingly the short interest **increased**. How is it possible that shorted shares, **if not naked**, did not have to find new borrows to cover? How could they have found 30M borrows in such a short period? 

&#x200B;

* **How were shorts able to increase their short position by 20M shares in such a short period of time?** In July 2019 GME bought back and retired 10M shares. At the same time, shorts increased their short position by 20M shares. How is this possible? How could they have borrowed 20M more shares while shares are being retired and removed from float?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d9fdeyrrw2i61.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=3efeb376b15e8574e98fa90622c79f1eadcd8772

* **Shorts did not close at $3 because of a tax loophole.** Shorts had been shorting GME since it was well over $40/share in 2015. By April 2020, GME had dropped to under $3, and shorts were sitting on **billions in profit.** Why not take profits? A little known **tax loophole** allows hedge funds to **pay no taxes** if a company they shorted goes bankrupt, as they do not need to close the trade, so the profit is not realized.  
* **Many of the major short funds are disciples of Steve Cohen, who previously paid billions to settle insider trading charges.** Maplelene capital, Melvin, others are all Steve Cohen cronies. Who bailed out Melvin? Steve Cohen. 
* **There are many strange connections between DTCC’s actions and shorts.** As you know DTCC/NSCC put a gun to Robinhood’s head demanding billions in liquidity to support their customers buying GME. At that point more than 50% of Robinhood’s users had GME. 
   * Robinhood is only worth around $10B. The amount being asked for from DTCC was likely to drive Robinhood into the ground had they not found a solution.
   * **Key question: Who suggested the buying halt? Was it Vlad? Or did the DTCC suggest a buying halt to as a negotiating tactic to reduce the liquidity requirements?** Sounds very much like a “turn off buying or else” kind of arrangement. 
   * Keep in mind, that at this point shorts were on the verge of losing **upwards of $50B** as **GME was well on its way over $500/share**. So Citadel doesn’t care about shooting down Robinhood. It’s a minor toe amputation to save their leg. 
   * The 4am call from the DTCC happened **2 days after Citadel and Point72 bailed out Melvin** and **1 day after the put:call ratio for GME flipped 3:1 for puts** \- not only was this coordinated, shorts knew this was coming and profited from it 
      * **If a regulator/lawmaker/SEC agent could figure out who bought those puts, you’d know something interesting.** 

# Why GME went up

* Many pundits in the media were extremely confused why the price of GME got so high. Let me try and explain this. 
   * First, the **current price of an equity is just the last traded price.** This is a very, very critical piece you need to understand. When there are 70M shares outstanding, and 1M shares get traded back and forth multiple times a day, the price you see is just the price of the active float trading back and forth. This is why many technical traders pay very close attention to **volume.** When there’s **high trading volume relative to total float**, it’s easier to believe the price is more reflective of actual underlying value. 
   * In the case of GME, **supply and demand** is the critical driver of price. As I mentioned in [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) the true supply of GME shares (tradable float) is ridiculously low) 
   * The demand side comes in 4 parts: 
      * Value buyers - people like DFV who saw a company at $4 valued less than 1 year cashflow and decided to tell the world about how great of an opportunity this was
      * Squeeze buyers - people and funds that smelled blood in the water and bought shares in anticipation of someone else **needing** to pay more
      * Shorts covering - shorts that needed or wanted to buy as the trade went against them
      * MM hedging - repeated gamma squeezes that had an outsized impact on price due to the low underlying liquidity of GME 
   * For a normal equity, most of that demand side **does not exist.** Low supply + high demand = high price. That’s why GME shot up. 

# The Big Reset

This wasn’t just a squeeze, this was a massive reset on investors (long and short) for GME. 

* Any SEC filings (13G/13F) showing positions prior to Feb 1 are **irrelevant** (other than insider positions). It’s very likely many longs liquidated during the squeeze, and likely many shorts covered. Some of those longs that liquidated may re-invest, and some of the shorts that covered may re-short. 
* Shorts were given a huge bailout, whereas they previously were sitting on losses upwards of $50B they were instead able to close positions at much lower share prices, with GME currently sitting at $49/share - a 90% reduction from its peak of $500/share prior to the buying halt on the 28th. 

# However, this is not the end for GME

* Everything started with value on GME
   * At $50, we’re back to a value play. GME’s market cap is now under **$4B.** Remember that GME has over $1B in e-commerce revenue alone every year and e-commerce is growing at 300%. For more on market cap potential, go see [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) or the excellent [gmedd.com](http://gmedd.com/)
   * **Nothing that happened in the last few weeks has changed the core fundamentals of the business** or the **prospects for a Cohen-led revitalization**, so if you were in this for Cohen at $20-35, we’re not too far off from that right now. 
   * If people can afford to hold their shares, the float continues to shrink 
* Wild cards remain (in order of decreasing likelihood) 
   * **Cohen still needs to buy his 7%**. He’s likely waiting for a good signal from the board that he’s going to be CEO as well as a good entry point. The officers added to the company on the board also need to buy their shares. They are not buying in at squeeze entry points. 
      * **Key point:** When insiders buy shares, their shares are removed from the lending pool. **This is part of the GME corporate bylaws.** I believe this is likely what triggered squeeze 1.0, as that happened roughly 2 days after Cohen’s 9M shares were likely recalled when he got added to the board. 
   * **Regulatory involvement.** It’s really unlikely the SEC is going to step up and enforce their own fucking rules, but hey if they did we might see some reductions in fails-to-deliver and the blatant naked shorting happening with GME. 
   * **Share recalls for a vote**. There are a number of reasons this could happen. I think it’s unlikely but if this were to happen non-naked shorts would need to cover. 
   * **People moving out of Robinhood** to brokers that can stop lending their shares - After this shitshow, I moved a few thousand shares out of RH. I didn’t realize they were being lent out to shorts and Robinhood was pocketing the difference. 
      * You can only get Robinhood to stop lending your shares if you move to a cash account, but **interestingly Robinhood’s instructions for how to downgrade to a cash account have disappeared from their site.** ([Try clicking on “downgrade” under Robinhood Cash here](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/)). **Shady AF.** 

# How I’m thinking about GME now 

This is going to sound extremely strange, but **I’ve never been more excited to lose money.** I am holding several thousand shares in GME, but my position is only about 25% of my desired position, and I can’t wait to buy GME at lower prices. I hadn’t bought any shares since $35 (see my part 2 when I said I went all in), and sold on the way up to take some profit, but I’m slowly starting to add again around $50 with the profits I made from trimming on the way up when it got above my price target I shared in part 2 of $125. 

None of this squeeze drama, broker drama, etc. changes the fundamentals of the company and why I was bullish in the first place. I think that the core short thesis of “GME is another blockbuster destined for death” is dumb and I think Cohen is going to cause a future re-rating of the company. 

Since part 2, some interesting developments have happened at GME, including the addition of new officers of the company (more Chewy execs and one ex-Amazon exec as the new Chief Technology Officer). 

I believe strongly that Cohen has a strong chance of becoming CEO. I don’t think they would have been able to add the talent recently had it not been for him, and the creation of a tech officer position is a clear signal that the thinking of how to run the company is changing. (Think about it - **if this was just blockbuster with a website why would they need a Chief Technology Officer?**) Big plans are afoot folks. **$4B for GME is cheap.** 

That being said, I’m hoping for a further dip. I’m **selling puts from 40 down to 10** hoping to score as many cheap shares as I can, and to take advantage of the still-insanely-high IV. 

# Suggestions 

This is going to be a long fight. It is painful for all of us, regardless of your cost of entry, because longs would have won the battle had the market remained free. Instead, funds, clearinghouses, brokers colluded to restrict buying and eliminate the demand side of the market. 

Here’s some thoughts on managing your GME positions going forward. 

* **Take advantage of IV while it is high.** While IV is still high, sell puts if you want to add, sell calls to reduce your cost basis. For example, I sold 2/26 9p for like $0.5 - **that’s a 6% return on capital in less than a month**, and either I own GME at $9 (awesome!) or I keep the premium (also good). I personally believe we will not be allowed to squeeze unless regulators step in and open up the market here, which will not happen quickly, if ever. So I’m selling calls against my remaining shares. 
   * I also sold some Nov 70p for \~$42. Let me explain this trade for those of you that don’t sell puts normally. Selling puts gets a bad wrap of “pennies in front of a steamroller” but this is **not the case with GME if you do it right.**
      * Someone paid me $4200 now for the requirement that I would be forced to buy 100 shares of GME at $70 in november (total of $7000). 
      * So I have to set aside $2800 of my own capital to secure this put. 
      * Two scenarios:
      * So, in my mind, this is a trade that “can’t go tits up”.
      * “Downside” risks:
* **Have your own price target:** Keep a valuation target in mind below which you believe it makes sense to add, and above which it makes sense to trim. If you are in need of some research here, see gmedd.com. I also wrote my own long-term bull targets in [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/). Buy low, not high folks - don’t fomo. 
* **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it’s an **attack vector** for you. 
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn’t resume for the rest of the day? **All your calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you’re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. 
* **Get the F out of Robinhood.** While Robinhood was just a pawn IMO, why do you want to use a broker that can F you so easily? They lend your shares to shorts and don’t pay you for it, margin call you when you’re winning, sell your shares at absolute lows, and pass all your data to Citadel. I don’t think the “free” commissions are really free. RH is worse for your financial future.
* **Minimize regret; don’t maximise profitability.** I sold some shares “early” on the way up to take out my cost basis and some profit. I missed all the peaks (never sold any shares above $400), but holding out for “maximum profit” led to a bit more regret when things went the wrong way.
* **Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I’ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing, you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I’ve held through multiple 50%+ drawdowns in the underlying; you need to be ready for the volatility. 
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It’s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you’ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it. 
* **Don’t sell on dips.** You’re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it’s heading up. Sell high, not low retards.
* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. Have patience when buying.

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. I’m holding what previously was valued at over $1M in shares and calls. And I added 1500 shares these last 2 weeks as well as sold hundreds of puts to either capture six figures of premium or buy 7 figures worth of GME at price points I find attractive.

# Bonus: If I was Maxine Waters, what would I ask?

On February 18th, Congress will be interviewing Robinhood, Melvin, Citadel, and DFV. Here are some questions I’d love to see asked with the answers aired out in public, under oath. 

## Dear Vlad,

1) Have they ever had such a dramatic margin increase request from DTCC before?

2) How much time have previous requests been given to accomodate vs this one?

3) Who suggested the solution of restricting buying? Was it Robinhood or suggested by DTCC as a concession in return for a reduced margin requirement? What other solutions were explored and why were they not pursued?

4) To his knowledge, are there any historical professional or other relationships between the decision makers in the DTCC to the funds that are/were shorting GME

5) What is preventing this from happening again, should GME’s price rise again to $500/share or more? 

## Dear Kenny G,

1) Could you explain the reasons for your bailout of Melvin capital?

2) How many members of the DTCC are former Citadel employees?

3) Did you or anyone in Citadel communicate with the DTCC prior to their margin changes to robinhood. If so, what were the nature of these communications?

4) What positions did Citadel take against GME prior to the buying halt on the 28th?

5) Did Citadel share any of its order flow data with any hedge funds shorting GME

6) Did Citadel have any communications with Robinhood senior management in the weeks leading up to the 28th?

## Dear Plumpkin,

1) Please explain how shorts are able to short greater than the outstanding float of an equity

2) Short interest increased by 20M shares in July 2019. Did Melvin increase their short position in that timeframe? If so, please explain how you were able to borrow shares when 40% of GMEs float was bought back

3) Please explain the method by which hedge funds do not pay taxes when they have a short on a company that has gone bankrupt

4) Are any members of the DTCC former employees of Melvin Capital? If not, please share what communications between the DTCC and melvin capital the weeks leading up to the 28th

5) Did you have any agreements written or otherwise with other major shorts of GME. I e. Maplelene Capital

6) There were 6000 short term puts purchased within 30 minutes prior to Citron's tweet announcing their pending argument against gme. Did Melvin capital purchase any puts on that day in that time frame?

7) What was the arrangement between citron and melvin capital?

8) Have you ever paid for media placements against GME

9) Please explain why you could state that you have closed your short positions when your recent filings say otherwise

10) Did Melvin open short positions on X-""R""-T when they closed their short gme positions

11) Please explain your process to locate borrows for shorts. With whom in the DTCC do you cooperate with?

12) Has Melvin Capital ever been forced to  buy-to-close short positions as a result of Regulation SHO / fails to deliver?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm0s6v/gme_endgame_part_6_the_big_reset_or_the_greatest/,1613614369.0
12,$CHK Chesapeak Energy. Cheapest billion dollar equity cap idea out there. Just came out of BK,13,0.78,Revolutionary-Lab382,"DO YOUR OWN DAMNED DUE DILIGENCE.

I am not a financial advisor.

I definitely like this stock and own it personally. I will buy more, I will sell it, I will do whatever I want with it.

IMO it is the cheapest > 1bn dollar equity cap idea in the market today.

Chesapeake energy emerged from bankruptcy (“BK”) a couple of days ago. Chesapeake is one of the largest independent gas producers in the United States. The company has been completely transformed during the BK process; it has barely any debt left for a Co. its size and has reduced cash costs by almost 50%. Importantly, all of the garbage that may have been in the company would have come out to the light during the BK process and consequently has now been cleaned up.

If you don’t know how BK’s work here is a quick primer:

Super expensive BK lawyers and fin advisors are hired to guide the Co. through the BK. The company then declares bankruptcy. Management fires a bunch of people, says it can’t pay off a hell of a lot of debt, and says it can’t honor a bunch of contracts. The different classes of debt holders have their own financial advisors and lawyers that the Co is likely also on the hook for battling it out to try to screw holders out of what the company owed them so that they can end up with a bigger portion of whatever remains. The BK court approves all of these moves to give the entire proceeding an aura of legitimacy as opposed to showing the battle royal that it is. In the background, BK lawyers and fin advisors are paying themselves a ridiculous amount of fees which once approved by the court can’t be challenged and most importantly management is restructuring its compensation package.

Since management wants subsequent shareholders to believe that they are doing a good job they provide a set of projections alongside the restructuring advisors that an 18 year old with a gardening degree could beat. The point of this is to have the options package that they (management) receive kick in at the lowest possible valuation and thereby have the highest possible compensation for themselves down the line. Pretty nice gig if you can get it.

On the topic of management teams, the geniuses at CHK made sure to hedge 80 pct of 2021 production at around 42 bucks a barrel. Oil is at 60. Had they done NOTHING with their “hedging”, into which I am sure they put in a hell of a lot of thought, revenues would be 40 pct higher, but hey that is why they have worked in the oil industry for decades and get paid the big bucks. Fortunately, they have not hedged too much of 2022 production and that is where the juice is. This sets the company up for a mediocre 2021 and a great 2022 at current gas and oil prices. This should set up management beautifully too.

So, to summarize how we got here. The first lien debt holders used the chaos caused by negative 40 dollar oil market to take away the company from the other debt holders. Now that the world is not over despite politicians’ best efforts; people still need energy. Nat gas in the Midwest is up 30 times in a week. Germany is importing energy because windmills can’t produce enough. Maybe just maybe 2021 will not mark the end of fossil fuels.

\*\*\*\*\* In LTMQ3 2020 CHK made 1.44 billion in adjusted EBITDA. That was with gas 11 pct lower and costs 50 pct higher. If you assume 20 pct lower production in 2022, current gas prices and current costs you get 1.66 billion in adjusted EBITDA assuming no changes in assets and liabilities, no other revenue, 100 mln in interest expense, and 10 million in other items.  (I have taken a lot of liberties in these projections)

I believe that the Co. deserves a much higher multiple than it used to have as everyone has known for YEARS that it was under threat of going BK due to high leverage.

13,My FUBO DD and why bears are fucked,14,0.77,agent_ailibis,"$FUBO [https://www.fubo.tv/welcome](https://www.fubo.tv/welcome)

 **FuboTV is** an American [streaming television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_television) service that focuses primarily on channels that distribute live sports, including [NFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League), [MLB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball), [NBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association), [NHL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League), [MLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer) and international soccer, plus news, network television series and movies 

&#x200B;

**Cord Cutting -** Nearly all Americans aged 25-34 prefer to access media content via the internet instead of cable. Cable and Satellite subscriptions are plummeting, Both AT&T and Comcast have lost over 100k subscribers this last year. There are approximately 40 million Cord Cutters and the projection is that number will grow to 55million by the end of 2021. Mind you these numbers are ONLY FOR THE USA! Read more here: [https://techjury.net/blog/cord-cutting-statistics/#gref](https://techjury.net/blog/cord-cutting-statistics/#gref)

Think about this world-wide, in countries that don't have fiber optic running to every house on the block and require 7 satellites just to watch a soccer game. Which, brings me to point number 2. 

&#x200B;

**Live Sports.** 

FUBO offers 50+ live TV channels, but in addition, offers a plethora of live sporting events. Soccer, Baseball, Football, etc. This is a major draw for many who only have cable to watch their favorite teams. 

In December it was announced that FUBO is planning to offer exclusive sporting events. Think PPV events only for FUBO subscribers. The bigger they grow, the bigger events they can pull in.

[https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/358901/fubotv-mulls-exclusive-live-sports-and-sports-wage.html](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/358901/fubotv-mulls-exclusive-live-sports-and-sports-wage.html)

&#x200B;

**Subscribers**

There are over 500,000 subscribers to FUBO. To put this in perspective HULU plus and You Tube TV, both have 3million+. So there is plenty of room for growth. The FUBO price tag is comparable to HULU and YouTube TV. As you can see, they offer nearly identical offerings for the price, but their edge is international soccer.

&#x200B;

**Sports Gambling**  
FUBO is developing its own sportsbook. With more states in extreme debt due to Covid19, they have no choice but to begin legalizing sports gambling which has been very beneficial in the few states that already allow it. Imagine being able to place live bets on your TV while watching the game. Will Patrick Mahomes throw a TD on the next drive? Bet now for +115 odds. As a gambling junkie, I'd be interested in this myself.

This is the catalyst. Earnings are coming out on March 2nd after the close. They whiffed big time on their last earnings report, but due to all the institutional buying, the Disney, and Comcast ownership, I'm inclined to think this report will be different.

DISCLAIMER: Futures, stocks and options trading involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. The valuation of futures, stocks and options may fluctuate, and, as a result, clients may lose more than their original investment. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains. If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account. You are responsible for all the risks and financial resources you use and for the chosen trading system. You should not engage in trading unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the extent of your exposure to loss. If you do not fully understand these risks you must seek independent advice from your financial advisor. All trading strategies are used at your own risk.

15,"Volatility play Flow Traders NV AMS: FLOW DD, highy undervalued.",11,0.82,SubstantialTowel1579,"  

With markets at an all-time high, not going in to any details weather this justified or not, it is unprecedented that volatility is stil super high. Here comes Flow Traders. 

&#x200B;

**What is Flow traders business?** 

Description on there website: 

*As a technology company operating in a financial environment, we use our principal technology platform to quote bid and ask prices in thousand of ETP listings, as well as similar financial products. We also provide liquidity to institutional counterparties off-exchange across all regions: the Americas, APAC and AMEA. Market participants benefit from higher execution quality and lower overall trading costs, while the market benefit form greater efficiency and more transparency.*

**Basically they make money by high speed trading. The buy and sell really quicky in the event of an price change. An easy example, imagine you(Flow Traders) are at a farmers market, looking to buy apples. There are two different farmers selling the same apples. One farmer changes his price upwards, because the harvest was disappointing. So you go really fast to the other lower priced farmer and buy a ton of apples and sell them to the higher priced farmer. You do this until the price is the same at both stands.** 

**Why is this interesting?** 

Volatility is there best friend. The more the price changes the more they can profit. That’s why when the market went down in march, volatility of course increased, and their stock/profit went up almost inversely to the stock market. But I hear yourself thinking the market has never been this high. And historically speaking the volatility should be declining. In comes the following graph: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f9os3d3x72i61.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c83d06481f0344f1877f5469d839192a5aa2cb9

&#x200B;

**As you can see the volatility is still abnormally high, this not normal for an healthy stock market. But that’s an discussion for**  **another time.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/07r6rzfy72i61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=990e342142b1cdb656aeeafbc8c88dabb3e17d15

As you can see the stock price perfectly correlates with the volatility graph above. Volatility goes up flow traders goes up. In my opinion volatility is only going to increase in the upcoming years. With the big inflow of retail traders and highly anticipated market correction. 

**Let’s talk financials**

As you can see flow traders has already steadily increased in the past couple months. As more and more investors see the potential. But if you look at there financials there is still tremendous room for growth: 

**Market Cap: 1.5B**  
 **PE Ratio: 3.44** 

https://preview.redd.it/s8t1d77382i61.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=3494e659d8a2e95966dc0a5e0d03b13a9c527030

They absolutely crushed 2020 with there cost only increasing 8%. They made almost 500 million in net profit with only a market cap of 1.5B. 

**Insider buying**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e9z6cqc682i61.png?width=241&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e058ea7cb2a8ba50e7ea4d5e8d4bfbe8a35f2de

A lot of shares are held by insiders. Moreover recently there were insiders buying more shares (I will put a link down below). This is always a good indicator. 

**Conclusion**

This is still pure speculation as to whether the volatility increases or decreases in the upcoming years. In my personal opinion volatility isn’t going anywhere with recent and upcoming macroeconomics uncertainty. But that’s for you to decide. Furthermore, if I’m wrong and the volatility decrease, this company is still very much undervalued looking at the financials. So that’s why for me this a long term hold. 

Looking forward to your replies and possible corrections on my DD. 

**TLDR: A volatility play. Flow Trades profit(a lot!) form the high recent and possibly upcoming volatility. Furthermore, this is an excellent market hedge.**

17,Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW) just had price target upgraded to $80 by Susquehanna and has earnings tomorrow....unknown company with business that is booming by multiple catalysts.,20,0.76,Amurphy747,"Hello fellow Autists, I posted about this company a couple weeks back and reposted the DD below. Tomorrow is earnings and multiple analysts have price targets of 77$-80$. There has also been unusual option activity for March options for the 60c. This is a mid cap that is overlooked but serious tendie potential.

The company is Atlas Air (AAWW). This article is an earnings play on a strong company that is not in mainstream media. If you wanna get straight to the point, just go to the end of this write up.

Atlas Air Worldwide is a leader in global airfreight, that serves freight, commercial, charter, and military customers. If you ever had an iPhone or PlayStation 3-5, or watched a San Diego Chargers game you've probably been impacted by Atlas Air. They have a combination of an efficient fleet, cost-saving operations, and superior customer service. With nearly 3,600 employees working across 90 countries, Atlas Air generated 2019 net sales of $2.74 billion.

They provide ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance), whereby they provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, including the provision of an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, while customers assume fuel, demand and price risk. In addition, customers are generally responsible for landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs;.

&#x200B;

[Flying our tendies as you read](https://preview.redd.it/a5pngcjv42i61.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=743ab94ab3384650ca027e929ce2d3a1112c0fdd)

The company recently strengthened and diversified its business and fleet with a focus on serving express and e-commerce, which has positioned it well to handle the increased demand in online orders and the future distribution of vaccines.  In the third quarter, management saw strong demand for their long-haul wide-body services. The company anticipates solid volumes in the fourth quarter, driven by continued e-commerce growth. They recently made a deal with Alibaba (BABA) to send their consumer's merchandise to South America and allowing them to grow operations there.

The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.69. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.53. Their biggest competitor is Air Transport Services group (ATSG) who even though has a bigger market cap, higher P/E ratio of 15.97, also happens to have a smaller fleet then Atlas Air and does not have the 747-800 which is the newest model of the 747 and most fuel efficient while carrying more weight which in this industry is crucial and helps them stand out from their competitors.

They just bought 4 more 747s to add to their fleet.

A resistance level has formed in the chart of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc.  If this level is crossed, a breakout could occur and has been at the same levels since November.

AAWW saw strong earnings and revenue growth in the third quarter with earnings up 667.6% year over year and revenue up 24.9%. The stock is trading at a low valuation with a Price to Sales ratio of 0.5 and a Price to Book ratio of 0.7.

The company’s cash position for the third quarter was $718 million, up from $72 million in the same quarter last year. Though that is considerably lower than its long-term debt of $2.4 Billion. AAWW has shown strong long-term momentum, but is down over the short-term.

**There are multiple catalysts that could cause this stock to break out.**

The first one is the fact that the company is being apart of the vaccine distribution and is expected for the next year to help distribute the vaccine because their aircraft can support and hold the refrigerators to carry the vaccines since they have to be kept cold.

Second catalyst. Atlas Air has a partnership with amazon where amazon leases their fleet to transport all their shit all over the world. With the epidemic and amazon growing like crazy this has only lead Atlas Air to grow. Amazon has warrants to buy up to 23% of the company by end of 2023. And its Christmas and I have a feeling Christmas records for Amazon are about to be shattered which means Atlas Air will be busy. Also typically around Christmas through February is the company's busiest time of the year even without

Third catalyst. Growth. Atlas Air is adding to its fleet (Just bought 4 more 747s) and is hiring more pilots to tackle the tasks at hand. Also passenger airlines typically when doing international trips hold additional cargo in their hull to make more profits, but with less international flights due to Covid Atlas Air has had growth in customers asking them to hull freight. And assuming Atlas Air does good with these customers and makes them happy their clientele should expect to grow.

Forth catalyst. Gasoline is pretty cheap, even though it is rising in price with vaccine news, it is still much cheaper then previously before for aircraft.

Fifth Catalyst maybe? As the coronavirus chaos is beginning to come to an end and super sexy overvalued tech companies are no longer as attractive this can lead to an emphasis on value and funds will be longer for their next growth prospects and this provides opportunity for value and growth and a way to capitalize off the coronavirus vaccine, amazon holiday season, and a ever changing world.

Sixth catalyst if you go into long term calls....every time there is a war Atlas air booms because the military hires them to fly out to the middle east and shit is stirring up in the Middle East right now.

**Passenger Airlines are responsible for 40% of air freight before covid...imagine what the earnings report will look like after this busy holiday season.**

To summarize, this is a well ran growing company and the stock price is poised for a breakout with a combination of these catalysts. The company is no where near its all time high yet it is the best it has ever been financially. The company is also owned over 90% by institutional investors so there is lots of smart money in the company who recognize value and the next earnings report is this month on the 18th and this company tends to have a run up towards earnings.

18,The ARK 3D PRINTING ETF,36,0.81,Shexter,"**Preface**

Thanks to u/DiscoFeverYeaYeaYea from r/mauerstrassenwetten whom I copied [most of this](https://reddit.com/r/mauerstrassenwetten/comments/lkzwo5/3ddruck_dir_geld_aktienanalyse) from.

**3D Printing Technology and its enormous potential**

Everyone who has worked with 3D printing technology before knows it is fascinating and it can do marvellous things. Recently, we have seen companies printing [medical equipment](https://www.nihlibrary.nih.gov/services/3d-printing-service/3d-printing-medical-equipment-response-covid-19-pandemic) to tackle the Covid-19 crisis. In October 2020, the first [entire residential building](https://www.archdaily.com/949531/3d-printing-for-residential-is-market-ready-germanys-first-building-is-under-construction) has gone under construction with 3D printing technology in Germany, requiring close to no building site workers. Airbus has recently presented a [3D-printed aircraft prototype](https://phys.org/news/2016-06-airbus-3d-printed-mini-aircraft.html). According to them 3D-printing will make aircrafts 30-50 percent lighter, while making them faster and save fuel.

3D printing can be used with all sorts of materials – **plastics, sands, even metals**. The technology is more efficient with factory space and human resources than traditional machines. Layer-by-layer production results in no material waste compared to other technologies. It is run with electricity and can be **CO2-free** in the future.

It is likely that every single sector in the industry will benefit from the technology. In medicine, it can used to print protheses, equipment or teeth replacements and in the future even [organ replacements](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/on-the-road-to-3-d-printed-organs-67187) might be possible. The weapon industry has started to [craft weapons using 3D printing](https://all3dp.com/1/3d-printed-gun-firearm-weapon-parts/). [Adidas has recently started 3D printing shoes reducing the production time by 1 week](https://theconversation.com/3d-printed-sports-shoes-are-more-about-your-wallet-than-your-feet-82287). There are many more examples but you get the point.

We are about to experience a second and even more powerful industrial revolution. However, as of now, **[only 1% of the global manufacturing market utilizes 3D printing](https://amfg.ai/2020/01/14/40-3d-printing-industry-stats-you-should-know-2020-redirect/)**, leaving a huge gap for growth. In my opinion, there is absolutely no doubt that 3D printing stocks will experience a **sky-rocketing long-term growth** similar to what Tesla has experienced but even beyond.


> BuT mimimi, 3D printing can never outperform sophisticated industry machines in terms of efficiency and cost.

This might be true for some products. Big companies with a specific set of products will likely continue to use sophisticated machines. However, 3D printing can be used to print exactly these sophisticated machines. Moreover, smaller companies and companies with a large set of varying products will undoubtedly benefit from 3D-printing.


To summarize the advantages of the technology:

* Reduction of human resources, production space, material waste and production time required.
* Less outsourcing required, therefore reducing global dependencies.
* Run with electricity, therefore potentially CO2-neutral.
* Extremely versatile and potential for all sectors in industry.

**The ARK 3D PRINTING ETF**

The ARK 3D PRINTING ETF (**$PRNT**) (ISIN: US00214Q5009) consists of business lines ranging from 3D-printing hardware, software, printing centers, scanning and measurement, as well as materials and resources. The fond is controlled by star investor Catherine D. Wood who was named the [best stock picker of 2020 by Bloomberg News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathie_Wood). 

3D printing is still in its infancy. In 2020, there was $17.5 billion in revenue for 3D printing. By comparison, Tesla alone made $31.5 billion in 2020. Toyota $250 billion. 

By 2025 alone, ARK expects sales to reach $120 billion. That would be a **7-fold increase**. However, the total potential is seen at $532.5 billion in the medium term (**30-fold increase**). McKinsey is even more optimistic and assumes sales of $180-490 billion by 2025 (10x-28x).

The **top 3 highest weighted stocks in the ETF are [EXONE (11.66%), 3D Systems (6.25%) and STRATASYS (5.62%)](https://ark-funds.com/3d-printing-etf)**.


**ExOne**

ExOne currently accounts for the highest share in the ARK 3D Print ETF with 11.66%. And because everything from star investor Catherine Woods is currently going gold, the hype here is probably only just beginning. With a market capitalization of $1.1 billion and sales of $59.41 million, it is also still very early in it's days. The current price cannot be justified by figures, even though the company has a **quarterly(!) sales growth of 59.9%**. That is why the P/E ratio here is very high at 15.23.
But what makes the company so special? Here, the big interest is likely to be the (quartz) SAND 3D printer. The biggest advantage here is probably simply the cost factor, since quartz sand is extremely cheap. The areas of application, as with all the other stocks presented, run through every area you can think of. In addition, there are metal printers, which could become particularly interesting in the heavy and automotive industries.

Pro:

* innovative quartz sand printers
* metal printers
* hype thanks to Catherine Woods and ARK-ETF
* 26.54% insider participation
* 48.49% institutional ownership (21% ARK)
* good revenue growth

Con:

* quite high PSR
* Little sales
* Free cash flow -5.67 million $
* only 300 employees

**3D Systems**

3D-Systems is currently the biggest player in 3D printing. We have already seen which areas 3D printing could revolutionize. 3D Systems offers a large variety of plastic and metal printing. They provide parts for automotive (cost reduction in production), aerospace (lightweighting), defense and military, dentistry, electronics (headphones, handsets), clothing (shoe soles) and more. That is why they are already working with NASA and Daimler among others.

Pro:

* market leader
* Innovative
* High number of employees compared to other companies in the sector (approx. 2500)
* A lot of experience (founded in 1986)
* Good cooperation partners
* Turnover makes it more than just an idea
* 68.02% participation of institutions (Blackrock 15.5%)
* 3.27% participation of insiders

Con:

* Low cash balance
* Low cash flow

**Stratasys**

Stratasys 3D printers are leading the way in plastics that can be used to make durable parts. To stay ahead in the technology battle here, they also recently bought out Origin for $100 million, which has worked with Henkel, BASF and DSM. Even if you have never heard of Origin: What seems particularly attractive here is that the set of plastics (whether soft or hard) is extremely versatile. The purchase alone is expected to generate $200 million in additional revenue over the next 5 years. From aerospace, to automotive parts, to fashion, many industries are covered. Among others, they have already worked with Volvo, Ford, Honda, Siemens, Audi, Airbus and Google.

Pro:

* 2266 employees (2017)
* Founded in 1989
* 308 million cash with only 19 million debt
* 78.17% institutional ownership (ARC 21.32%)
* 5.97% owned by insiders
* Leader in plastics and health care printing.
* Fair valuation

Con:

* No real USP
* Quarterly sales growth -18.8%

**Risks**

The recent hype around 3D-printing technology will lead to a temporary drop of stocks, affecting the ARK ETF (hype cycle). It might be smart to wait until the dust has settled a little and then start investing. Furthermore, the stock will be extremely volatile while climbing up, similarly as seen in the Tesla run. Panic sellers will likely lose money here.

This is no financial advice. 


**TL/DR:**

The 3D printing business has recently made huge advances such as printing medical equipment, protheses, weapons, shoes and even entire residential buildings and an aircraft. 3D printing is extremely versatile and can reduce costs of human resources, space requirements, materials and often increases efficiency. Even though the possibilities and advantages are enormous, **only 1% of the manufacturing market utilizes 3D printing** at this point. The industry is expected to **grow between 7 to 30-fold (!)** by 2025. The ARK 3D Printing ETF ($PRNT) contains the most important stocks to watch and is managed by Catherine Woods, who was named the best stock picker of 2020 according to Bloomberg News.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llx2mb/the_ark_3d_printing_etf/,1613604754.0
19,Welcome to the Boomer EV play Fucking Ford $F,135,0.88,JJTortilla,"Alright here is the deal and I'm gonna tell ya. Everything right now is EV this, EV that, oooh heres a Lucid and theres a Lion, look at that NIO and wow what a Tesla! But what about the boomer version, what about the big money, classic company, total run up play of the EV market. Well I think its Ford and here are my reasons why:

Disclaimer: Blah blah not financial advice, blah blah do your own DD, blah blah don't trust random internet strangers for financial advice ya retard. 

1)  Right now Ford's Market Cap is just shy of $46 Billion. This is the Fourth largest automaker in the world in 2019 sorted by revenue. In other words, they are a big boy, they make cars, they've been doing it for over 100 years now, they know their shit. But still, they don't get much credit. Ford is often labeled the second biggest car company in America and never talked about. Why? They stale. You don't have to tell me they are boring, that's why I labeled this a boomer EV company. You invest in Ford for the dividend, because its stable, a high cap that's ole reliable. But here I'mma tell yew wat, that's changing. And the fact its perceived that way and is actually changing is gonna mean big big investment. Lets get to it. 

Ford has a new CEO and his name is Jim Farley. Now this guy isn't the guy that's set the stage so far, and we will talk about that, but this guy has some unique energy.  In the last earnings call for GM and the one for Ford, they essentially reported the same thing. 4th quarter numbers were surprisingly good, company still lost some money, we are going to improve bottom line in 2021. But man oh man were the results different. Jim got on that phone and talked about taking warranty costs down and making 2021 a focus on tightening up the company even more, and boom the stock went up. I didn't even listen to the GM call, but the highlights were practically the same, and GM took a hit. The difference speaks for itself. Now if you want something of a character model for Jim but you are too lazy to look up and listen to video of him, just imagine Jim Farley as the modern day Tommy Boy (because you know... his cousin was Chris Farley.... who played Tommy Boy.... fucking young twats go watch the movie its hilarious!). He is determined to make Ford GreAT AgAIn!

2) Now some comparisons. As we all know, Tesla's fundamentals don't matter. But the idea here is that if Ford starts announcing money moves, its fundamentals will stop getting in the way! First off, the most relevant brands to compare here are going to be Tesla and Rivian, why? Model Y and the R1T are what Ford will be directly competing against first. And I'm going to break out the R1T first.

Lets face it. Everyone that is reading this post has touched, seen, ridden in, or at least heard of the F-150. It is the most recognized and biggest single vehicle brand in the world. GM can occasionally make and sell more trucks then the F-150, but they have to do it under two brands (Chevy and GMC). Ford tried making a luxury F-150 under Lincoln, but it didn't sell as well as just making a luxury F-150 (think platinum editions). Why does this matter? Ford is going to make an electric F-150. This has been a rumor for so so so long, but the massive investment in Rivian and the latest confirmations have shown that Ford has put a lot of effort into developing an acceptable electric drivetrain for the F-150. Now lets look at the R1T that will be the direct competitor. Rivian is expected to IPO soon and is looking to get an initial evaluation of $50 billion. Oh wait, what's that? An EV company that is launching with 1 or 2 models wants to be a $50 billion company? And Ford is going to compete in that space with a similar product and is only currently a $46 billion company? Hmmmmm.... If the electric F-150 is teased in September and it is at all competitive with R1T that alone should double the stock value. Ford would be gaining a whole new set of customers with a stronger brand name and already established manufacturing base and quality, and they wouldn't need to fight the uphill battle of trying to get into Tesla's well established brand and market of small and luxury EVs, they are getting into EV pickups the same time as everyone else! This is arguably the biggest reason I think the stock is going to double this year, but it needs proper setup to truly understand the potential.

3) Lets work back up the time line here. Ford can't just bust onto the scene with an electric F-150 and expect to take the cake and eat it too. Big boomer name auto companies are viewed as old and unmoving, they can't make changes, as someone I know tries to explain to me, ""Its suCH a BiG boAT Its gOInG to TAkE FoRevER to CHanGE CoUrSe!."" What they fail to realize is that Ford has been making moves to switch it up for years. What did they result in? Why the Mustang Mach-E of course.

The Mach-E is currently one of the most polarizing vehicles in the American vehicle enthusiast communities right now. You gotta understand. Ford made it through years of selling lackluster (in my opinion dogshit) Mustangs on the name alone! It has an image, a brand, that carried the full lineup even when Mustangs were slow and didn't know how to make power and meet emissions (or be fun). And that branding means anything with the Mustang name attached should be a two seater coupe with power and loud, dirty, gas powered bad boy image behind it. Ford could have made the Mustang Mach-E a new model, they could have made it its own thing and launched it as a new EV, the start of a new era or some other friendly bullshit. But instead Ford said, ""we need eyes on this thing and we need to make a point with it. What should we do?"" and the one guy in the room who didn't give a fuck anymore said, ""Well call it a Mustang, that'll do it."" And the fucking Chads did it! What's GM's big EV at the moment? The bolt, which they already burnt the branding on with dumb looks and weird commercials, and the Hummer, oh great a dead brand for people who need you to know they have a big swinging dick maybe. Ford is showing that they have the willingness to leverage their most recognized brands to launch a new EV image of the company. That's huge! And if the Mach-E does well, performs good, and gives a good impression to the car media people, that will be the real proper setup for the electric F-150. Especially since it can be compared directly to the Model Y. It'll be Ford vs Tesla, and all Ford has to do is go the 12 rounds, they don't even really have to win.

4) So now we get into the boomer money and how its going to set this thing off. Now I know I talked about our favorite boomer auto CEO Jim Farley, but lets talk for a second about everything that's happened before he got there. Ford is exiting the sedan and car market in North America. Why? It doesn't make money. Why is Ford so concerned about making big money. Aside from it being a company, well its balance sheet doesn't look too good. Is it horrible? Meh, the Debt to Equity is still horrendous, but the rest of it isn't bad per se. Ford has been trimming and fine tuning its production for years to get out of the debt it took on during the financial crisis and the last thing they wanted to do was retool everything to make EVs. But despite having a ridiculous ratio they've snuck investing in EV, battery tech, charging tech, and autonomous into the budget over the years. And Jim is taking over and immediately talking about reducing warranty costs and on hand inventory and things, the traditional stuff that hits Ford's operating bottom line. This is great! Improve profitability, that's what boomer and institutional investment love to hear. So, do we think the stock could go down? Well, look at the bears, the short interest in the float is super super super low, something around 1-2%. No one thinks this stock is going lower. And that's a good thing. It means almost everyone in Ford is in it as an investment and those buys aren't going anywhere. And it means, this is the entry point, it takes off from here. As Ford starts to come up and we see a steady rise over this year more and more institutional money and boomer retail will get in for the value growth.

5) As for gas. This is part of why I think Ford is a great all around sentiment change value investment. For years Ford has been releasing fun cars with the intent to rejuvenate the brand like the Focus RS and the Fiesta, but they were niche vehicles that still tried to be economic and whose base trims were still normal and boring. But it wasn't until recently that they have started to blatantly play into the enthusiast's desires in an attempt to build rep with actual car people again. Look at the Mustang GT350, GT350R, GT500, the Bronco, the new F-150 Raptor R. These aren't attempts to make a ""Green and eco friendly lineup"" no no no these are blatant fan favs that people have been screaming for for years! And branding is everything. And when you can already make bombass cars like these, people tend to trust you to make other things like that electric commuter car you really need. 

6) Finally we get to the last and arguably the biggest reason this stock could pop off. Fleet vehicles. Ford controls around 40% of the fleet vehicle market. Think about that. All those companies that need fleets of vehicles that you can think of, 2 out of 5 are Ford supplied. I personally work at a company that uses fleet vehicles as a perk for the upper management and you know what they all have? Ford F-150s. About 12 of them parked in a nice little row in the parking lot. And you know whats weird about that? The next row is of normal employees that want to be like management, and my beat to hell Dodge Ram from 20 years ago stands out like a sore thumb between another nice little row of pretty new F-150s. Its a weird effect, but my point being fleet vehicles is a huge market, and when they start going electric, Ford will be poised to take up even more market share. Not only will Ford be able to pick up sales from fleet vehicles, but Ford already offers electric transit vans, you know, the kinda vans that do last mile stuff like install your cable, or DELIVER YOUR AMAZON PACKAGES. Yeah, those types of vans. Fleets of those will be going electric soon. And government contracts? Oh you better believe Ford is gonna get its share of those through the Green new deal. Fucking A is it.

7) And now we get into the latest and greatest stuff. Ford is investing in building electric where electric is going to sell well with a huge investment in Germany. But this also means that they think they can make more money competing directly against Tesla in Europe as well. Now that's confidence considering how crowded the EV market is in Europe already. But also, Ford keeps making money moves in the EV space and really focusing on building an EV side of the company instead of trying to transition its Gas side. This is good, it means that they hope to add value as opposed to transition it which is what will blow the roof off the market cap! 

Anyways, thats what I got. Its not great and I can talk for hours, but its an honest opinion. 

TL;DR Fuck you, that took a long time to write! Electric F-150, Mustang Mach-E, Ford not afraid to leverage its biggest brands, electric transit vans, fleet contracts, government contracts, exciting gas powered cars like GT350,GT500, Bronco, Raptor R, new Chad of a CEO Jim Farley who is modern day Tommy Boy, Improving fundamentals that Boomers care about, and coming out the gates this year swinging for Tesla. Also Rivian is gonna IPO for more than Ford is worth?

20,The Rocket is still Fueling. Buy Your Tickets for $SENS ASAP,944,0.83,Useful-ldiot,"Here we go Gents - my first DD.

I've been a casual autist for years, but I finally feel like I have something to give back, in terms of a short, succinct DD.

First - let's make this clear. I'm an autist. This isn't financial advice. Just yesterday, I tweaked my shoulder eating dinner. And it wasn't even my fork shoulder.  

I know I'm not the first to mention $SENS on here, but let me give you 5 reasons why you should put in your order for some tendies before the kitchen gets too backed up.

 🚀 ) $SENS is a company focused on Diabetes tech. Why should you care? Because us 'Muricans love our tendies and a good chunk of us have eaten so many that our pancreas stopped working. The diabetes industry is massive AND A VERY SIGNIFICANT CHUNK IS OWNED BY ONE COMPANY - $DXCM. What the fuck? This is $SENS DD and you're bringing up a competitor? Yes. I'm telling you it's 2015 and you're getting the option to buy $AMD at $5 even though $NVDA owns the space. The runway is LONG and HARD my sweet prince. $DXCM has a market cap of over $40b. $SENS is under $2b. I'm not saying they're going to switch places or even out. I'm saying $SENS is criminally undervalued right now and could easily hit $15-20 in the very near future and in my uneducated opinion - go to $50 by EoY.

 🚀  🚀 ) $SENS has tech that is mind numbingly better than $DXCM. If you aren't aware, $DXCM makes those sensors you see stuck to hips or arms that measure tendies:blood in real time. It's a huge leap forward from the old days of having to prick your finger every hour. HOWEVER these sensors need to be changed out regularly. How often is regularly? Five to ten DAYS. I personally called my diabetic friend and he said it was annoying AF. $SENS takes a difference approach, with their sensor lasting 3 MONTHS. 3 MONTHS > 10 DAYS. This is disruptive.

 🚀  🚀  🚀 ) $SENS has a rocky history that can be completely explained by several rational decisions. If you've gotten to my third point, there's a decent chance I have you interested by now. But eventually you're going to look at $SENS trading history and realize it was at $5 years ago and tumbled down to $0.50. WTF? Well - most of this is easily explained. They raised capital several times, which we all knows kills stock value. They were attacked by our good friends on Wall St. And the FDA delayed their testing (in various capacities) by over a year due to COVID. Raising capital is a good thing long term. The FDA has finally moved forward with the critical 180 day test (i'm told this is the final step towards approval, but don't quote me) and Wall St. can go fuck themselves.

 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀 ) $SENS 'looks better' and will be 'cleaner' to use. WTF? Who gives a shit about looks? Well - just about everyone. No one wants a Tamagotchi glued to their hip/arm for everyone to see. It's unsightly. The $SENS system is a subdermal (I think it means under the skin) implant that communicates with your phone every 5 minutes rather than relying on a sensor above the skin taped on like a barbarian. Not only will it look better, but it's also more reliable. Remember all the way back in 2) where I mentioned the 90 day vs 10 day thing? Imagine you're in the military and on active deployment. Which one do you think the Army is going to assign you? Word on the street is the $SENS system will be the choice of sensor by the military in the very near future and it makes complete sense when you think about how dirt and shit can mess up an external sensor.

🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀 ) This is WallStreetBETS. We aren't here to invest safely. The fifth reason to invest in $SENS is when we blast off to the moon, you don't want to be the one saying 'fuck, I should have listened to that useful idiot when I had the chance.'

21,Best in biotech $SAVA DD,16,0.76,kittensNclaws,"The older I get the more retarded I feel, in comes SAVA to save me from myself. Do not take what I say as advice (see the previous sentence), I just like the stock. I have been following SAVA for my entire 3 week career as an investor and when I saw the spike in SAVA a few weeks ago and heard about the Alzheimer's Disease(AD) drug Sumufilam they were developing, it piqued my interest so I started to do some digging.

This is my first (lazy apes) DD so it is going to be lacking. I am a moron, I know how to read words, it's the numbers that still trip me up. Here are a few key points I have learned from reading recent news.

No new AD drugs approved since 2003. Current medications have limited function to treat symptoms. Sumufilam takes a novel approach in its action (for retards: fancy new products make big money).

13 Nov. 2020 IPO 9,375,000 shares at 8.00

02 Feb. 2021 Data from open-label study of Sumufilam showed significant increase in cognition and function in those with AD. Stock price surges from 18.93 to 87.95.

10 Feb. 2021 Stock draws back sharply with profit taking and a widely denounce $200m institutional stock sale to fund phase 3 trials from 87.95 to 44.80. I buy in at 46.12.

16 Feb. 2021 SAVA announces plans for a Phase 3 trial in late 2021 price increase to 51.83

It would be great if someone could take a deeper dive into this company. I really dont know what the hell I am doing, I am just a healthcare provider with a hope and a dream.

Edit: I used to ""read"" Maxim in the late 90s and dream of becoming a boyfriend to one of the hotties while their husband made me rich. Apparently they set a SAVA price target of $80 this morning.

# The Business Model:

Alibaba serves as the Paypal, Square, eBay and Amazon of China. Alibaba serves as the one stop shop for all ecommerce and even non ecommerce related goods and services. Did I forget to mention Alibaba has its own movie production company? (AMC Anyone?) The synergy of the ecommerce arm: from allowing sales and purchases, accepting payments for sales and purchases, and even potentially financing those same respective sales and purchases makes for an ironclad business model. Alibaba also has numerous investments in many different industries and regions around the globe. 

**Ecommerce, Online Retail, Wholesale** – Alibaba’s bread and butter. Alibaba has a multitude of sales channels that have different buying and selling methods with various different products and audience targets. Their ecommerce encompasses all relationships between consumers, businesses, and both. 

**Cloud** – Cloud computing is a top market right now given that we’re not only working from home due to the pandemic, but we will also implement many of these habits in perpetuity as many businesses switch to a hybrid WFH format. Best synergizes with AutoNavi (Google maps of China) and data collected from consumer sales.

**Digital Entertainment and Media** – From streaming to video hosting or even online ticket booking, Alibaba has it all.  You can purchase tickets to your favorite sports event, movie, or watch it all online. 

**Notable Alibaba Owned Companies/Services:**

**Taobao** – Marketplace and online retail platform focusing on **consumer to consumer** online stores and purchases. Includes Taobao Grocery, Taobao Short Video, Taobao Live, and many more to come

**Aliexpress** – International retail online platform for Chinese sellers to sell products. Example markets may include: Russia, Brazil, Singapore, U.S. and more)

**Tmall –** Online retail platform to sell name brand goods to consumers in the greater China region. This is mainly a **business to consumer** platform

**1688.com** – Wholesale platform with many digital sellers. This is the largest wholesale website in China which primarily functions as a **business to business** sales platform

**Youku** – Digital streaming and online video hosting service for Alibaba; similar to YouTube

**AutoNavi** – Maps services; comparable to Google or Apple Maps

**Daimai.cn** – Online ticket booking service; Similar to Ticketmaster

**Alipay** – Accepting payment methods for your ecommerce purchase, movie tickets, taxis, or even to send from peer to peer. Alipay is standard across many stores in China and many regions in Asia as a dominant payment platform with 

**Ant Financial Group** – Fintech; Use for financing for small purchases

**Alihealth** – Helps consumers find health insurance and receive medical treatment

# The Bull Case:

**Playing Catch up:** 

Alibaba has crushed earnings on the past 7/7 reports despite regulatory headwinds, international/domestic political pressures, and a pandemic. 

Given the previous financial data, if Alibaba were to trade at even half the P/E of Amazon (78.15/2= \~39) Alibaba would be priced at: **$363.79**

If Alibaba were to be priced at 75% of what Amazon’s current PE is (78.12\*75% = 58.6125) Alibaba would be priced at: **$545.68**

Analysts currently have a downside price target of $270 and an upside of [$387](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-alibaba-beats-earnings-estimates-164805712.htm) [according to Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-alibaba-beats-earnings-estimates-164805712.htm) finance. These price targets can easily be revised upwards with positive sentiment and an increase of both earnings and share price. With an upside of $387 for the year, that’s approximately 43% upside (even more so with options) that will make your leaps and shares mouthwatering to purchase.

**Who’s on your side?**

[Cathie Wood](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-sells-tesla-shares-184315217.html)– As of Nov 2020 sold Tesla shares to purchase Alibaba within its Ark Innovation ETF $ARKF

[Ray Dalio](https://hedgefollow.com/funds/Bridgewater+Associates) – Recently purchased and currently owns approximately 400 million dollars of Alibaba in the Bridgewater Associates hedge fund which is the largest hedge fund in the world

[Jim Cramer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FASe4D_pEi4&t=140s) \-As of Jan 2021 Lightning round mentioned to buy Alibaba

Most of Wall Street – According to [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/BABA/price-target/), numerous large institutional banks and equity research firms (including JPM, Citi, HSBC) have buy or strong buy ratings with price targets easily in the 300+ range.

**Potential Catalysts:**

Ant Group IPO – For stakeholders, this has been a long awaited IPO. Alibaba owns a 33% stake in Antgroup which was set to be one of the largest fintech IPOs in history before it was blocked by the CCP. A reintroduction of the IPO may send shares flying

More Hedge Fund Buying – This stock is one of the largest holdings of many investment funds, hedge funds, and large portfolios. This is also considered a safer stock which appeals more to larger funds who are looking for potential returns

Buybacks – Alibaba boosted their current stock buybacks plan from 6B to 10B reiterating confidence within the company and ideally, will boost the stock price 

The monopoly probe ending – China slaps Alibaba on the wrist with a few slight changes within the marketplace and a small fine that they can easily write off

China Friendly Political Environment – With Trump out and Joe Biden in office, we may see more relaxed regulatory pressure on Chinese stocks (delistings, business bans, etc.)

One of many of their investments kicking off: One example of this is Alibaba's recent partnership with SAIC in the EV space with improved battery technology. If Alibaba is partnered with a company that develops FSD technology, this could be one of their biggest catalysts

The JACK IS BACK: Jack Ma was recently found to be safe through various video clips and word of mouth. If he were to show his face publicly and make a public statement or apology, this could help lift off the stock further

WSB!: Although this is a large cap stock with many shares outstanding, the traction and buying power of WSB collectively could easily put this stock on the radar of larger investment funds and add to share price

# The Bear Case:

**Equity Research Findings:**

>\-A Morningstar equity research report specifically stated: “Expansion of other China digital commerce players like Pinduoduo and JD.com could slow Alibaba's growth aspirations in certain product categories.”

Translation: Alibaba will STILL grow despite other players gaining in additional market share for the business. Let me repeat this: Alibaba’s key bear case is that they will not decline or stagnate; THEY WILL STILL GROW albeit slightly slower 

**China will try to take Alibaba out of the picture:**

\-The CCP will end Alibaba and give the reigns to someone else

China and the United States have been in constant fight to come up on top. What makes the United States a dominant force is not only their policy and military, but also our **top companies and infrastructure**. China is aggressively catching up to the United States as a super power as a close second place (See NIO, Xpeng in the EV race compared to Tesla or Huawei vs Apple in the race for 5G infrastructure). Do you think that China would even consider dissolving their top company in terms of internet and consumer infrastructure? Do you think that effectively scaring off fund managers (who currently own Alibaba), foreign investors, and foreign business interests will be a net benefit to China?

**CaYeMeHaN IsLaNd sToNkS aRe fRaUduLaNT!!!!**

\-If you make this claim, read this [writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kk4lei/vies_and_baba_et_al/) by user u/wilfredian before putting your red nose and clown makeup on. TLDR: You can convert your American shares into Hong Kong shares for actual equity ownership at ANY TIME. Meaning it’s not just some pretend company; it is functionally equivalent to the shares traded on the HK exchange.

The Chinese are looking for more foreign investment in their economy (what developed country isn’t?). Think about this intuitively, China would not sabotage its golden goose (Alibaba) and breach the contract with many of its foreign partners to flex its political muscle on one company.

23,Why I think Palantir will be net profitable next quarter (and stay that way),138,0.88,avl0,"So if you're interested in PLTR i'm sure you paid some attention to yesterday's earnings reports, quite a lot of fud around disappointing earnings (not warranted, imo) and the lockup ending this week (possibly warranted, we will see, but not relevant to this post.

I saw a lot being made of PLTRs lack of profitability after 15 years (legitimate concern) and criticism about how much they pay themselves in stock being the cause (ditto). So, wanting to know the deal I stuck my tongue out, concentrated real hard and tried to read the numbers from yesterday's report, here are a few for the quarter:

**Gross Margin:** 79%

They report headline adjusted gross margin as 84% which excludes stock based compensation, this seems a cheat because it's essentially just pay so i added it back in for the 79%. Regardless, this is equivalent to facebooks margin, and has improved 12% over the last year. I'd also expect it to improve further next year, as I think a lot of the stock based compensation for this year was a one off and related to the DPO.

**Operating Margin:** 32%

Again this is adjusted to exclude stock, stock related taxes and DPO charges, but if you look at stock based compensation from Q4 2019 ($77MM) to Q4 2020 (\~$260MM) you can see that in a regular year, which 2021 will now be these stock related payments are going to go back to normal (though still higher than 77 due to higher pay & more staff, i'd guestimate $100MM a quarter for '21).

All of this is to say that PLTRs margins are actually great and if they hadn't taken the company public this year they would've been profitable already.

Now lets look at **Q1 21 forcast**:

45% YoY growth from Q1 20

23% adjusted operating margin

We can probably assume safely that these are going to be beat, a company with a model like PLTR's are going to be pretty sure what contracts they've got lined up in Q1 and they're not dumb enough to miss earnings by over estimating, we can likely expect these to actually be more like 50-55% and 30-35% IMO. For example, in Q3 20 they predicted $50MM (16% margin) in adjusted profit for Q4 and it ended up being $100MM (32% margin).

That gives us: 240 (Q1 2020 rev) \* 1.5 = $360MM rev in Q1 with an adjusted operating margin of 30% = $108MM adjusted operating profits Q1 '21. Unadjusting them if we assume stock based compensation relatively higher than 2019 and early 20 because of growth but returning to normal levels because the DPO is done, i guestimated $100MM in stock compensation leaving them net profitable for the first time.

I'd expect this to continue throughout but they don't offer much guidance for the rest of the year, just > 30% revenue, this was the same guidance they gave in Q3 2020 so just seems to be their minimum bar, does suggest they aren't more worried about growth in 2021 than they were in 2020.

&#x200B;

**Why does none of this matter anyway?**

1. PLTR have $1.8BB in cash and practically no debt ($200MM short term), so even if they lost $100MM a quarter to grow quicker, it's not a threat.
2. They're already super profitable, they just pay themselves a lot in stock bonuses, the lack of profitability is a choice, they literally sid that right now they don't care about profitability. Presumably this is because they feel they dont need to invest in capital to grow and instead focus on recruiting and then retaining and working hard (with $$$ incentive) the biggest brains they can find as being the most optimal path to growth and success. As an investor i'm perfectly fine with this because they're in their growth phase and an extra 10% growth compounded over several years will reap way more in profit than taking some profit now, anyway their margins are so good I know that eventually there's going to be profit for investors regardless.

Possible dips for following stocks based on different market short volumes syncing up and rising, based off of previous [post here predicting dips using different market volumes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li5vch/i_think_i_found_a_way_to_predict_dips_with_nasdaq/) TLDR of that is there's a pattern when different market volumes start to sync and rise for a stock, said stock has a dip.

* **SNDL** dip **ESTIMATED** later this week depending on tomorrow's numbers, but maybe Thursday/Friday, but it may peak tomorrow, but watch for dip to follow!
* **TLRY** possibly later tomorrow but probably Thursday/Friday, depending on how/if price spikes tomorrow!
* **PLTR** estimated to keep dipping tomorrow **if it's not already too late**, but **volumes are synced HARD** and **short volumes have continued to grow despite consecutive days with price drops!** Hopefully Feb16th was the peak for short volume and they start to retreat tomorrow.

[SNDL has the short and short exempt volumes starting to rise going into Wednesday. Expect a rise in price followed by a dip after, maybe Thursday\/Friday!](https://preview.redd.it/o56u4uzsozh61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=cba47b2031a321a168cc201ac6e80afa1e283777)

**TLDR: Don't trust strangers on the INTERNET!!!!!**

* SNDL looks like the volumes are STARTING to sync, so late week dip possible
* TLRY's definitely look like they are starting to, update tomorrow after numbers come out, so dip probably Thursday, doubt it's as soon as tomorrow.
* PLTR volumes should have **CALMED the fuck DOWN** by now, but they're peaking?! Either dips tomorrow hard again, or we hit the floor, hopefully.

25,$HRB H&R Block - Buy some leaps and forget about em,23,0.74,louis_lafaille,"TLDR: Brick & Mortar  to tech pivot, share buyback, delayed share price recovery, cheap options = Buy and hold HRB Leaps

I'll keep this short because you guys have the attention span of a five year old:

5 Reasons to Buy $HRB Leaps:

1) HRB is currently valued as a Brick & Mortar boomer company (price/sales ratio of \~1x) while their main competitor Intuit $INTU is valued as a tech company (\~14x). However, H&amp;R Block is pivoting to a digital-age company (or at least trying to.) Last year, they added 3 VPs of information technology and acquired Wave Financial, a financial SaaS company funded by Social Capital. 

2) They have been buying back shares. Lots of shares. HRB's shares outstanding has fallen from 300m+ to under 200m since 2010, thanks to their share repurchase program. In 2015, HRB approved a $3.5b share repurchase program and they still have $600m of that which will fund their buy-backs into 2022. To put that into perspective: HRB's current market cap is $3.6b. They've been consistently buying back shares AND paying their dividends for over a decade. These repurchases also show up as losses in earnings report, thus giving the appearance of poor results to those who don't look carefully. When you compare its current price (\~$19) to its price in, say, 2019 (\~$26), don't forget that there are now \~10% less outstanding shares compared to back then!

3) Almost one year later, HRB still hasn't recovered to its pre-covid share price. In fact, even S&P has gained 75% from its March lows, while HRB only gained 59%. Looking at historical price data, HRB had its strongest run in '01 and '12: both about two years after the market recovers from a major downtown. Will 2022 be the year HRB reaches new ATH? I think so.

4) Rise in retail investing. To keep this short: if your tax situation is simple (just wages and a couple of deductible items) you can probably figure out how to file your taxes on your own. If you've been investing, however, you are better off talking to a tax professional. (Did you know that you may be able to offset taxable income up to $3000 if you have capital losses that exceed capital gains in a year?)

5) Something something death and taxes

IV on leaps are not bad right now. I bought some 2023 $25C for $1.77 the other day, and it's one of the cheapest leaps in my portfolio. 

Disclaimer: HRB 2023 20c and 25c x 10. This is not investment or tax advice. I like the stock.

It's true that Bili is currently growing at a faster rate than HUYA, 70% as compared to 50%, however, this difference is huge, and I believe that HUYA can reach at least 10x P/S considering it is still a growing company.

&#x200B;

3. Institutional Holdings

Ark, MS, and Rentech heavily added positions in HUYA last quarter. A quick google search tells you that Tencent has a 37.2% stake in HUYA. Excluding companies below JOYY Inc. because the reports are old, we would get a total of 112.15% institutional holding. 

This is a similar situation to gamestop, although I don't this should be a short squeeze play, I think that a squeeze is very possible under the right conditions.

4. Potential merger with DOYU

If they do merge, DOYU would be a better play because the share exchange ratio would be HUYA\*0.73=What you get for each DOYU share, but DOYU is the riskier play in this situation if they don't merge because DOYU is consistently losing market share to HUYA in china.

Some quick DD on Chinese websites tell you that Chinese people tend to prefer HUYA

Even if this merger doesn't go through I see this as a very good tech ""value"" play

7. Chinese stock craze

The Chinese stock market has been going harder than the US market recently. There are many Chinese stocks that are breaking out. Some examples include FUTU, TIGR, BILI, TME, YY.

I believe HUYA could be next but this is pure speculation.

c) Qualified Semiconductor Equipment.—For purposes of this section, the term ‘qualified semiconductor equipment’ means any property—

“(1) which has been identified by the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, as machinery or equipment that is designed and used to—

“(A) manufacture or process semiconductors, or

“(B) perform research with respect to semiconductors,

“(2) which is placed in service in the United States by the taxpayer, and

“(3) with respect to which depreciation (or amortization in lieu of depreciation) is allowable.

Massive tax breaks and funding. Also major push to increase Euv tool consolidation and production.

INTEL CAN BUILD 5NM and will probably receive the bulk of the support.

While the NDAA's CHIPS section doesn't outright authorize $10 billion in taxpayer funds, it does mention the 3nm manufacturing node. Right now, the only American company with the equipment needed to produce 5nm chips is Intel, whose 5nm is thought to be comparable with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) 3nm node – for which TSMC's already started plant construction. (Arizona, 2024 open date)

These laws  make their way into the NDAA through Section 9906 titled 'Advanced Microelectronics Research and Development'. Part (c) of this section directs the Secretary of Commerce to coordinate with the Secretary of Defense to establish a National Semiconductor Technology Center. This will be dedicated to developing and prototyping advanced chip technologies for securing the American domestic chip supply chain through a public-private partnership.

Back during the onset of covid, Bob Swan wrote a letter to the DODexplaining the need for a DOD backed foundry plant in the US to combat China. The primary purpose is to build secure micro electronics under the complete auspices of the US military. This would cement INTEL as the defacto chip supplier for the US and its military allies. This also means labor would be subsidized in part by the DOD.

While the CHIPS title expands the federal government's focus on reclaiming the chip crown for America, it isn't the first such program. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Electronic Resurgence Initiative is another program that aims to develop key chip technologies domestically.

British design house Arm Ltd. is a beneficiary of this program, through which the company will provide access to all of its commercial chip design architecture and intellectual properties for DARPA use. Arm is currently subject to an acquisition attempt by NVIDIA, with multiple companies across the U.S. having objected to the deal, as they join their counterparts in the United Kingdom and China, citing fears of anticompetitive behavior.

Biden is expected to sign an executive order in the coming weeks to ""undertake a comprehensive review of supply chains for critical goods,"" including semiconductors, Psaki said.

The Information Technology Industry Council, an IT trade group, sent a similar [letter to Biden](https://www.itic.org/documents/general/ITICHIPSActLettertoPresidentBiden_Feb2021.pdf) this week, calling on him to include ""substantial funding"" for the CHIPS Act as part of his budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal year.

Such advice could be instructive when the Biden administration carries out its review of semiconductor supply chains — part of the planned executive order Psaki said will be signed in the coming weeks.

""The review will be focused on identifying the immediate actions we can take, from improving the physical production of those items in the US to working with allies to develop a coordinated response to the weaknesses and bottlenecks that are hurting American workers,"" Psaki said.
## A critical industry both for technology and defense
Psaki's comments, and the industry leaders' letter to Biden, come during a critical global shortage of semiconductors.

The ban on using Chinese companies electronic devices or products was so strict contracts where being threatened with being voided if there was a single Chinese built security camera. This means in order to combat china the US government has to back Intel's eventual dominance over Asia. Intel  cannot fail.. Intel has the greatest chance of success in America of taking Asia on, it cannot fail. There have been increasing articles about Intel being Necessary to national security and continued US global dominance.

The Chinese show of force came days after investors sent shares of semiconductor giant Intel Corp. [**INTC,** **+1.07%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/INTC?mod=MW_story_quote) tumbling, thanks in part to incoming Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger’s announcement that the iconic semiconductor manufacturer would continue to [make the bulk of its chips](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/intel-decides-on-path-where-there-is-no-easy-or-quick-fix-and-the-stock-is-getting-pounded-11611332418) in the United States, rather than outsource production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

“We work to close any gaps with external foundries as well as keep ahead,” Gelsinger said. “And clearly we’re not interested in just closing gaps, we’re interested in resuming that position of the unquestioned leader in process technology.”

The second part I would like to bring up is Intel has a new CEO starting tomorrow.  Bringing his own team on board. 2 Intel veterans returning to teach them how it's done. And 1 Vm ware heavy Hitter.

 For those that want a sense of who he is, listen to Intel last earnings call [https://www.intc.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/8508/q4-2020-intel-corporation-earnings-conference-call](https://www.intc.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/8508/q4-2020-intel-corporation-earnings-conference-call) . The man has a PLAN. He studied under the greats of intel. Royce Moore and Grove, I'm pretty sure it was all 3 but I could be wrong. He rise through the ranks from technician to Chief Technology officer . His rise was meteoric. He is the hope of Intel. He was shaping intel's culture in its heyday, he knows how to recreate the Intel of old.

Curiously A lot of Vps have left the company. headcount was reduced using..... interesting methods. The fiefdoms have and are being broken up. after Murthy left his entire position was kind of removed and everyone who reported to him now reported to the CEO directly. The power struggles are NOT being tolerated anymore. just one company. Help wherever needed. if it needs to be done right you do it right. No question, Efficiency is king.

The third point I would like to bring up is Intel recent purchase of Israeli company Habana Labs. They are producing a product that allows machine learning to occur with GPU's at faster speeds than NVIDIA can. (Disclaimer I might be misquoting the article and over simplified it) No one has been able to make a dent in Nvidia like this before. Not the article that I had in mind but here's one [Gaudi Gaudi yall](https://newsroom.intel.com/news/aws-leverages-habana-gaudi-ai-processors/#gs.szvwf3)

[intel-ext-generation-leader](https://www.gfmag.com/magazine/february-2021/intel-next-generation-leader)

High-performance chip competition from ARM, Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA threatens Intel, which is hoping that Gelsinger—formerly its Chief Technology Officer  and later head of software maker VMware—will bring greater innovation and help it regain market share in a changing environment.

“Intel’s biggest challenge is to improve its execution of its ‘leading edge’ manufacturing as it has fallen behind TSMC and Samsung,” says Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. “It also needs to drive adoption of its new Habanera machine-learning training chip, Habana, to better compete with NVIDIA.”
The market for deep-learning chipsets is predicted to burgeon from $6.6 billion in 2018 to $91.2 billion by 2025, according to market research firm, Valuates Reports. NVIDIA is the market-leading producer of graphics processing units optimized for training AI and deep-learning models that can process multiple computations simultaneously.

But Intel is already beginning to cut into NVIDIA’s lead. In December, Intel announced that Habana’s Gaudi processors will power Amazon Web Services’ Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud for machine learning workload, rewarding Intel’s 2019 acquisition of Habana.
Intel will be making significant gains in the AI Market 

Intel also has a new Discrete Graphics card lineup coming online this year that will give them an edge, it's a nice way to profit off your competitors inability to produce its own gpus.

Its being built by TSMC allowing INTEL to compete in that market early.

The loss of product leadership. It matters.......to a point. How we classify our chips ie, 7nm 5nm and the like is kind of archaic. What actually matters is transistor density. It doesn't matter that you can build chips at 7 or 5nm the space is subjective to who built it. Intel  has a record of having a higher transistor density than its competitors.

[Naming coinvention for Process nodes](https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/)
INTEL is not that far behind process wise. We can innovate too. If you use transistor density it puts the process differences in a different light
In a recent paper, researchers suggest that semiconductor companies should ditch the loosely defined transistor gate length as a measure of technological advancement (i.e 7nm or 14nm), and instead focus on transistor density. That's near-enough the same metric Intel's been proposing for years now, but this time it's also tacitly supported by Intel's greatest rival, TSMC.
Well, one researcher from TSMC The paper is titled ""A Density Metric for Semiconductor Technology,"" and can be found in [Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 108, no. 4, pp. 478-482, April 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9063714) (via [TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/266351/researchers-propose-new-density-metric-for-semiconductor-technology)). It's nine authors hail from Stanford, MIT,  Berkeley, and TSMC. Within the team posit that a change is required to standardize the advances in semiconductor lithographic manufacturing technology across the industry.

[intel 14nm AMD TSNC 7nm transistors micro compared](https://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/145645-intel-14nm-amdtsmc-7nm-transistors-micro-compared/)

Having looked at the above comparison, and highlighted it in his video, der8auer challenges the obvious conclusion that Intel 14nm+++ and TSMC 7nm are very similar in physical scale, reminding viewers that the above pictures don't fully represent the 3D structure that is so important to modern chip optimisation. Moreover, the relationship between node size, half-pitch, and gate length has significantly loosened since the early 1990s. The XXnm figure reflects process history more than progress, asserts the OC expert, and thus it isn't very useful as a metric to compare between chip makers.
 probably something worth closer consideration is transistor density, as revealed by the chip fabricators. Intel 10 nm and TSMC 7nm processes both produce dies with approx 90 million transistors per sq millimetre. Moving forward both Intel and TSMC are targeting approx 150MT/mm² for their upcoming 7nm and 5nm processes, respectively. Again though, other factors make differences, like transistor type and chip architecture, that make direct comparisons difficult. 
The node size is an approximation transistor density is the metric that should be used. 
[is-smaller-always-better-in-chips-intels-new-10nm-superfin-technology-suggests-otherwise](https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/21/is-smaller-always-better-in-chips-intels-new-10nm-superfin-technology-suggests-otherwise/)

When it comes to manufacturing technology, we’re taught that smaller transistors are better. They switch faster and use less power. They take up less space, carving out room for more cores, more cache, and ultimately better performance. And when foundries can fit more dies onto the same sized silicon wafer, costs go down. It’s no surprise that the technology world anticipates each process shrink with bated breath.
Today, node names largely represent generational progress. They don’t reflect gate length; the pitch, width, or height of modern field-effect transistor (FET) fins; or even transistor density. It’s consequently difficult to cut through the marketing and compare competing process technologies based on their names.  But because Intel struggled to bring 10nm to production, the company must now endure contrasts between its 10nm transistors and the 7nm nodes from TSMC and Samsung. Fortunately for Intel, the 10nm node holds its own, even though naming suggests otherwise. Heavy investment into beefing up 10nm helped Intel facilitate[ a \~2.7x density improvement over 14nm](https://newsroom.intel.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/09/10-nm-icf-fact-sheet.pdf), packing more than 100 million transistors into a square millimeter of die area.

The second part of this is Intel's manufacturing capabilities.

There's a shortage of Intel's competitors chips. TSMC can't build what AMD needs to actually make a dent in intel's revenue stream. The same goes for NVIDIA but IMO to a lesser degree. The third part of this is the massive shortage of IC chips in general, in particular the auto industry. This means Intel will hit 70 within a month or so maybe less. This also means IMHO there's no end price target  if the foundry plant comes online in a few years. I love Intel i'm not giving investment advice, I'm just betting on a few hair brained ideas and the innovation and Indomitable spirit this company has the  the grit and the wear withal to hold until it can play catch up.

 Bob Swan did great with what he knew how to do. He gave Intel cash and was the bad news bear so the new CEO could have a clean record And to clear out some of the clutter and take the flak for it. 

Intel and American chip manufacturering will soon see a rise that will allow them gain traction against Asian rivals. With the Instability of  Taiwan The DOD could very likely back Intel over tsmc Just to prevent a scenario where China could extend influence on how if or what we received from Tsmc. As stated above, there are certain situations where China has been aggressive  of late. Would you want the possibility of your high end chip manufacturing to be shut off overnight?
INTEL SOLD NAND.
 within a few years the transfer will be complete and jntel will be mostly divested from those businesses.

These views are mine and mine alone and this isn't investment advice.


Tldr: Intc has a high chance of regaining process leadership by government
backed programs. Mostly the chip act. 
This also creates a research and development hub that has industry and state backed entities. Creating hybrid private public entity.  American chip manufacturing has the complete backing of the US government and public funding that will give Intel which is the most advanced American chip maker the edge and tools necessary to regain process leadership. 

Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive.

28,DDDD - Was GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold Part 2 (A look at Jan 15 to 29 SEC Data),1357,0.92,ASoftEngStudent,"In this DDDD (Data-Driven DD), we'll be analyzing some Failure to Deliver (FTD) data released by the SEC for Jan 15 - 29 to definitively see if there's been any shady shit going on with GME; namely, illegal (or legal by MMs?) naked short selling. This is a continuation of a similar analysis I did [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/larhlw/dddd_is_gme_being_illegally_naked_short_sold/) when the last data set was released, with a few modifications. Since I'm sure 99% of y'all are barely going to read this entire thing, let alone read a second wall of text, I'll just re-use some of the content and explanations in this post.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**What is a Failure to Deliver?**

A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it.

**Methodology & Caveats**

I'm going to process the raw SEC data and join it with some market data from an API, which I'll paste below. This processed, enriched data, which I have uploaded [here](https://www.file.io/download/SbQSw9PUtZfS) for anyone wrinkle-brained enough to dig through the data themselves, is then analyzed by another script to answer several questions to help definitively show what sort of involvement of naked short selling in GME during Jan 15 - 29. The answers we're going to specifically answer is

1. How many days saw a significant amount of FTDs for GME, and how does that compare to other stocks?
2. What was the total value of FTDs of GME during this period, and how does it compare to other stocks?
3. **What % of the volume for GME couldn't be delivered during this time?**

The last part is the most important imo, since GME accounted for an absurdly large portion of the market's volume for multiple days in January, so if you don't normalize for volume you'll obviously have GME top every analysis in absolute terms.

Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred (i.e. T+2 settlement), so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results if anyone goes through the raw data.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date.

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out while answering those questions, so it should give a fairly accurate, albeit imperfect, representation of this.

**The Code**

Feel free to skip this section if y'all are code illiterate, but putting this here for transparency and so that someone can call me out if I'm making any of the results up or if I have a bug somewhere, which considering I threw this together in less than an hour, probably is the case. If you do see something wrong pls comment and I'll fix it if it's legitimate.

Hopefully, this data speaks for itself, but as a TLDR

What does stand out is that GME has the most days with FTD > $25M (8 days) and cumulative value of FTDs (> $1B) in the SEC list

but

Both can be explained by the fact that GME accounted for a disproportionately large amount of the total volume during the period. If you **normalize by volume, GME becomes the 66th stock with the most Failure to Delivers**. While this may show that a few players have been doing something sketchy, it doesn't look like there's any systematic fraud going on.

29,"Ammo shortage and making tendies, an academy sports love story",37,0.81,Pyr0smurf," 

**TLDR;  ASO is an outdoor recreation company, that is a genuinely undervalued compared to comparables that will continue to benefit from ammo shortage inflation**

There  has been some very good DD posted lately on VSTO and them as a solid  play due to the ammo shortage. I am here to educate you about a  comparable that has not gotten as much attention, ASO.

**Fundamental shit (via filings and yahoo finance)**

VSTO  trades at a p/e of 36 currently. ASO is trading at a p/e of 10 with a  similar market cap and float. ASO is currently also operating at a  higher profit margin (4.3%) comparable to VSTO (2.81%) and they have  comparable cash on hand. They do however carry more debt and have not  seen as high a yoy growth. Their free cash flow is significantly higher  though. **P/s ratio is .39 vs. VSTO's .88**  (Lower is better here, you're paying .39 cents for every $1 in sales).  ASO also has a slightly higher market cap at just over 2 bil.

In terms of raw numbers, ASO is actually closer to competing with DKS in the outdoor leisure space, with the added bonus of the ammo shortage. for reference DKS trades at \~$73 with a P/E of 17 and a p/s of .74. Analyst consensus is $27 for ASO, but if they post another er similar to Decembers in April they could easily be trading in the $50 range at just a slightly higher p/e.

**My own thoughts and such**

BUT RETAIL IS DEAD!!!! Sure, but Academy is concentrated in red states that have been open for months where you can buy guns and ammo when its in stock. I checked google maps for this part, I aint driving my nyc ass out to investigate. 

All  this out of the way I see ASO as a good medium to long term investment.  It also stands to benefit from the HUGE backlog of ammo orders in the  short term (estimated currently around 1 billion dollars worth). It has  more room to run than VSTO IMO and can easily catch up to DKS.

**The reason you want to check it out**

Now you're probably asking, why the fuck do I care about a good long medium-long term investment on WSB? Well aside from their April earnings call, lets talk about the elephant in the room. Short Interest. As per YF its 39% of the float, and from all the sources I could find are the highest in the entire Russell 3000. They also IPO'd in October, and are currently near the 52 week high which was reached just last week. Every short is reasonably assumed less than current share price. In a company with large growth potential, that posted a great 1 st er  in Dec (seriously they damn near tripled eps estimates). High end estimate has been raised for April,But the midpoint looks like an easy beat still.

I'm in march and april calls $25-30 strikes. Roast away retards.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llm1mq/ammo_shortage_and_making_tendies_an_academy/,1613564888.0
30,"$CMPS - shrooms, the new weed",127,0.82,jamesonc92,"**TLDR: Buy $CMPS. Huge untapped market about to explode.**

**INTRODUCTION**

1. CMPS is a biotech company that has received breakthrough therapy status from the FDA and is using a patented synthetic version of psilocybin (i.e., the active agent in “magic mushrooms”) to target the treatment-resistant depression (TRD) market of >100 million people who have tried two or more existing treatments without success.
2. To be clear, COMPASS Pathways is a biotech/pharma company with world-class thinkers and investors. This is not about recreational drug use.
3. Thiel is an investor, owning 7.5% of this, along with other big names.

**THE TEAM**

4. CMPS’ stacked board of directors and scientific advisory board includes:• David Norton – former Chairman of Global Pharmaceuticals giant Johnson & Johnson• Tom Insel – former Director of the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and co-founder of Mindstrong Health• Thomas Lonngren – former executive director of the EMA (i.e., the European FDA)• Professor Alan Schatzberg – Director at the Stanford Mood Disorders Center and Professor of Psychiatry at the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine• Professor David Nutt – Neuropsychopharmacology chair at the Imperial College London, President of the The European Brain Council• Chief Development Officer Trevor Mill who spent the past 25 years at Biogen, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson leads the CMPS R&D department.

**PRICE TARGET**

“You get paid in direct proportion to the difficulty of problems you solve” ― Elon Musk

5. The TAM for people with depression who have failed two or more previous treatments is over 100 million people. There has not been much innovation in mental health since the invention of Prozac in 1988.

6. Tom Insel, former Director of the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) stated: ""Mental healthcare needs innovation… The COMPASS medication-assisted psychotherapy strategy is innovative in that it integrates medication and psychotherapy. And it is disruptive by offering patients a treatment that many people prefer.”

7. At a current market cap of 1.6B, the PT is to reach the same market cap as Tilray during the weed boom; implying a **10x** valuation to $500 a share.

**CATALYST**

8. Biden Administration. With the push for weed legilisation, the next step would be psychedelics, where the results have been astounding for depression (also many other uses, like reduced smoking, binge drinking, etc)

9. FDA Approval - Expected 2022 - 2023. Phase 2b trial data available late this year. Expecting a huge pop when the data shows late this year. Phase 1a trial showed an incredible efficiency of 4/5 patients with significant improvement (No data collected on the 1/5 patients).

**FUNDAMENTALS**

[4h chart](https://preview.redd.it/zwoakavvtyh61.jpg?width=1671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f732f93b45a66d96435fecb36c0c75f2d2efefe)

10. Looking at the 4H chart, the resistance SMA has become the support for current price action, with a clear bounce off the SMA line. RSI showing a reversal.

11. Current market cap of only $1.6B.

**CONS**

12. Biggest drawback is that the company only has one drug (as far as the public knows). You are essentially banking it all on this one drug.

13. Company makes $0 revenue now. Its all R&D.

**CONCLUSION**

Early mover's advantage from CMPS, pioneering the use of psychedelics to combat mental illnesses. My personal 10 bagger stock, with 250 shares in.

EDIT: Position: 250 shares at 51.6585 on 12 Feb.

31,Is Uranium the future of clean energy? 🚀💎,425,0.83,teedubski3,"Denison Mining Corp welcomes you to the era of clean energy. 

Now that Joe Biden has taken over the office of the president, we are seeing a push to decarbonize the economy, and what better way to decarbonize the economy than nuclear energy? Nuclear energy will soon be the poster child for clean energy. There are three things you need to know about nuclear energy, it produces minimal waste, its land footprint is small but most importantly (at least for us investors) it’s a zero-emission clean energy source. Why is this important for us investors you ask? Nuclear energy generates power through a process called fission. Fission is the process of splitting URANIUM atoms. For all you mouth breathers that aren’t following along...
💎CLEAN ENERGY=URANIUM. 💎

If you want to get rich during the Biden Administration and beyond you need to get your filthy little hands on some sweet Uranium. However, there are multiple Uranium companies out there, how do you choose the right one? Well boys and girls, I’m here to tell you about this great uranium mining company called Denison Mining Corp (DNN)

Denison Mining Corp (DNN) is a uranium mining company based out of Canada. This company is a lucrative buy because it owns 90% of the Wheeler River project which is at this point in time the largest undeveloped high grade uranium project. Denison mining is perhaps in possession of the single best uranium deposit in the world. We are still in the infancy stages of this company and all it has to offer the world of clean energy. Their market cap just hitting $1 Billion today, which is just the beginning. So if you’re trying to get to the moon, hop aboard the DNN rocketship.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀WE LIKE THE STOCK, REMEMBER CLEAN ENERGY=URANIUM, URANIUM=DNN🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

As always, do your own DD! It’s your money, only you can decide what stocks will take you to tendie town! I’m not a expert nor is this financial advice.

EDIT: So adding this on after reading some comments against nuclear energy. The real question is not whether you personally believe nuclear energy is the future, it’s whether the governments and other entities in charge think it’s the future. It would be great if we could all do geothermal, solar or wind but those sources don’t work in every geographic location.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lljwet/is_uranium_the_future_of_clean_energy/,1613557748.0
32,Why the best remaining weed play is $MO options 🥦💨🚀🌝,24,0.61,Natural_Profession_8,"**TL;DR: Distribution networks, regulatory experience, patent portfolio, acquisitions, under-valued company, Michael Burry, cheap (low IV) options**

*Disclosure: I am long $MO LEAPs. I am not an investment advisor. Please do your own due diligence before investing your money, and never gamble with more than you’re willing to lose.*

Altria operates the Marlboro brand in the US and commands ~50% of the US cigarette market. Altria is perfectly poised to dominate the US marijuana industry. Just how likely is this? Senator Chuck Schumer [is shitting his pants over it.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/amp/)

Why will Big Tobacco, and Altria more specifically, win the Weed Wars? They are the only companies with the distribution channels and regularity experience to succeed in what is likely to be the rapidly changing environment of the legalized marijuana market. In addition, Altria has been taking major steps in this direction recently, purchasing a 45% stake in major Canadian marijuana company Chronos in 2017, and recently filing a number of patents related for vaping devices with the ability to deliver either THC or CBD in measured doses.

Here’s the good part. Altria’s core business is already way under-valued due to poor management decisions that led to one-time investment write-offs. So undervalued that it’s one of the top holdings in Michael Burry’s Scion Asset Management fund. And on top of that, options on $MO are dead cheap, hovering near 20% IV. For instance, Jan 2023 $65c’s are only $1. I believe that if marijuana is legalized, $MO will re-rate and could hit $90, giving those options a 2,500% upside from today’s price.

In summary, stop playing around with insanely high IV and over-valued speculative weed companies, and bank on the winner that was right in front of you this whole time.

Positions: Jan 2023 $65c’s (if you believe that weed legalization is imminent, you can go earlier with a lower strike. I just think this is the safest bet)",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lljczw/why_the_best_remaining_weed_play_is_mo_options/,1613555991.0
33,Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) is undervalued and here is why (part 2).,47,0.77,UnBonCitoyen,"This is my more extensive DD about this boomer stock, I will repeat a few things from my other DD [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll3sq2/why_shell_rdsa_is_undervalued/).

First of all, yes this isn’t a very exciting EV stock (or is it?) and it won’t make you rich overnight BUT it won’t make you go bankrupt and it has some potential.

HISTORY:
The pandemic hit this stock pretty hard (60$ -> 25$). Why? Pure stupidity. The company didn’t change, it kept producing ENERGY. You had completely delusional people who were thinking that Shell will go bankrupt lol (everyone with an IQ above 50 doesn’t need an explanation to see that this is retarded). Others were/are thinking that Shell is a pure oil company and that oil is something from the past. From their point of view, we will live in a completely different world without plastics, without non-EV, without pills (yes you need oil to make pills, medication) etc. Aka they are also delusional.
The REAL REASON why the stock price plunged: they cut the dividend.

BUT on the other hand, they announced that they will increase the dividend each year with at least 4% AND they will buy some shares back as soon as their debt is bellow 65 billion. (I think they might also increase the dividend even more when they reach this target, the stock price will go up in each case) “Shell outlined a long-term plan to reduce debt to $65 billion and to aim for shareholder distributions of 20-30% of cash flow” [link](https://www.oedigital.com/news/482818-ceo-says-shell-s-oil-production-peaked-in-2019)

WHY WILL THEY HAVE LESS THAN 65 BILLION DEBT IN THE VERY NEAR FUTUR

Look at those oil prices!! 13 month high!! They will keep going up!! [link](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Hedge-Funds-Flocked-To-WTI-Crude-Ahead-Of-Texas-Cold-Snap.html) [link](https://www.pennlive.com/life/2021/02/gas-prices-at-highest-in-a-year-and-expected-to-increase-more.html)
Shell has a break even price of 31$ per barrel, this means that they make 32$+ PROFIT per barrel with a Brent oil price of 63$+. 
Shell produced about 920k barrels per day in Q4 2020 aka during the second big worldwide lockdown aka worst case scenario [link](https://www.shell.com/media/news-and-media-releases/2020/shell-fourth-quarter-2020-update-note.html)
So what does this mean? They are making a fuck ton of money and they will reach the 65 billion debt very soon.

Shell is a ENERGY stock, NOT just oil.
Shell also produces hydrogen and natural gas (LNG).

You know what’s also at a 12 month high? That’s right, gas!!! [link](https://www.naturalgasintel.com/natural-gas-futures-called-higher-as-severe-cold-brings-chaos-to-u-s-energy-markets/)

EXTRA HIGH natural gas and oil prices because it’s extremely cold and refineries are closing, it can take several weeks to get them fully operational again [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-u-oil-refinery-shutting-180345565.html)

SHELL will become a carbon neutral company by 2050 [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56022908)
They will gradually make this change, this is healthy for the company. Here is a non exhaustieve list of what this change implies:
-Shell acquired UK’s largest EV charging network [link](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ubitricity-m-a-shell-idUSKBN29U0TC)
-This is a huge one: Shell made synthetic kerosene (aka carbon neutral!!) and it worked!!! [link](https://news.klm.com/world-first-in-the-netherlands-by-klm-shell-and-dutch-ministry-for-infrastructure-and-water-management-first-passenger-flight-performed-with-sustainable-synthetic-kerosene/)
-Shell has it own electric scooter! [link](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210216006045/en/Lotus-International-Company-Partners-With-Shell-to-Extend-Its-Brand-Into-E-Mobility-With-the-New-Shell-RIDE-E-Scooter)
-Shell opens first hydrogen refuelling station of H2Benelux in Amsterdam [link](https://www.waterstofnet.eu/nl/nieuws/shell-opens-first-hydrogen-refuelling-station-of-h2benelux-in-amsterdam)
... and the list goes on

Important note about the ticker:
You can trade the stock at AEX (Amsterdam), GBX (London) and NYSE. There are two types of shares, A and B. Each type has its own tax regime (only for the dividend) so you need to do your own research to  see which regime is the most beneficial for you. This might be quite complicated but in the end it has a small impact so you shouldn’t worry about the difference if you’re not planning to buy a lot of shares.

TLDR:
Oil and gas prices are at a 12 month high -> stock goes up
Shell is more than an oil company, they will lead us to a green future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lli3z5/royal_dutch_shell_rdsa_is_undervalued_and_here_is/,1613551795.0

You may be thinking to yourself, ""but we buy Teslas, yachts, and airplanes to fly over Robinhood's main building! Why would I EVER touch a Rolls Royce!?"" I'm here to tell you.... They don't make cars. [THEY LITERALLY MAKE ROCKETS...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Rocket_engine_manufacturers_of_the_United_Kingdom) You're also probably thinking, ""BUT WE HAVE SPCE! WE DONT NEED ANOTHER ROCKETSHIP EMOJI!?"" Ahhh but do you know who SPCE needs? [RYCEY](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/03/virgin-galactics-early-supersonic-aircraft-design-partnering-with-rolls-royce.html) . Yes this is right. Beloved SPCE NEEDS Rolls-Royce...

&#x200B;

Ok this is beside the point. You retards are probably wondering, ""Then why does their chart look like shit? (besides yesterday...) AHHHHH the real question. Imagine this. You make airplane parts and sell those parts. You also service those parts. Now a pandemic hits... O.K.... Not as many flights so you get your sales hit... Oh wait... less sells and less flights means less wear on the parts... OH NO... no more servicing the planes either... FUCK. So you get doubly fucked by the pandemic. Your stock tanks like... 85%... GUHHHHH.

&#x200B;

Ight, now... lets say a pandemic is actually looking like its lightening up.... What does that mean? ""you right now: AHHHH BUT THE PANDEMIC ISNT DONE IT IS GONNA BE HERE FOR FUCK BLAH>>> OADHLKJ WDOH "" ok ok ok settle down. Its called preemptive maintenance! You don't wait for a bunch of people to say ""HOLY FUCK I NEED TO FLY RIGHT NOW!?!?!"" and then try and get your shit up to code. NO, you fucking fix it now so when the flow of people come in you have your shit together and can put this fucking shit to work. No word out right now if this is happening but.... it makes a fuck load of sense ... Fuck me if I'm wrong. Apparently they get paid on a ""hours of flight"" basis anyways and I'm probably just REALLY retarded bring all this up.

35,Let’s talk about meat boys,35,0.71,djyosco88,"We are on the horizon of some big meat slapping gains here. We just need to find the right companies to get into. 

We are talking synthetic meat. Lab grown bovine. Chicken of the lab. There’s tons of companies out there that are getting into it. 
I’ve yet to really see any public and I’m hoping we can all figure out some good plays. 

Mosa meat- not currently public. Probably very close to it though. They where taking private investments and then stopped. I’m wondering when they plan on going public. 

Memphismeats.com
Product testing stage. They have products but nothing for public consumption. They are us based. Still no investors but they have reports of thousands of investors who want to part of their company. Tyson holds a major stake in this company. TSN may be a play here as well, until Memphis ipos. They are building a pilot plant to start to scale production. 

Eatjust. California based company. Some products. They will be pushing products soon. They do plan on being in Singapore restaurants soon

Aleph farms is another. They state the current cost for 1 steak is about 50 to produce it. It will eventually go down. 


I’ll be honest. This post is prob 3-4 years to early. But we gotta get this on our radars now. The sooner we can get into these future companies the better. There are more than 60 companies working on this right now. With companies shooting for net zero by 2050 we are getting close to this being a future top contender. It solves problems with food production on another planet or space in general. It would transform our farming methods. 

Tyson and cargill are saying within 3 years to have it on shelves. 

Richard Branson and Bill gates are investing heavy in this. They see this as the future of how we will eat. If people aren’t vegetarians then they will be eating this. It will be considerably more than regular meat early on, by 2-3 times. But within 10 years it should be cheaper. 
It looks like Memphis meats will be their play. 

Singapore is very progressive with this. They will be the first to launch it and have products for consumption. Keep an eye out in their market. 

Tldr:  TSN  may be the play for the early on investing of lab meat. Raise your awareness and keep your eyes peeled. I plan on slapping this meat on Mars.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lli2hv/lets_talk_about_meat_boys/,1613551662.0

37,Why I think $PRCH is the next Zillow,28,0.66,CaniBorrowTP,"Why I think $PRCH is the next Zillow

Porch is a one stop shop for all homeowners. Why does that matter? Because buying a home is stressful. I know you fucks spend your time drinking piss in your parents basement so you wouldn’t understand, but after your GME and weed stocks finally fucking print you’ll be buying a house and you’ll need help getting it setup.

When I look at companies to invest in, I look at three key points. Management team, financials and market cap. I only invest in companies that can “realistically” blow the fuck up. 🚀 🚀 I’ll break it down into sections.

Management team:
Honestly I’ll just link [it](https://porchgroup.com/team), because its extensive. One thing to take note is the amount of very experienced vps that lead all the subsidiaries. I also really like the CFO and the CEO looks like a major nerd which is a plus. 

Financials: 
I’m still new to financials, but I spent my day off as a male prostitute to study $PRCH’s. One thing to note is they have little to no debt, they have negative income from 2019-2020 but that was purely because they acquired Elite Insurance and some sort of Real estate company. It’s clear they are expanding. 

Also, they have a 36.9% short float. Why in the fuck is this important? Because it’s an up trending stock. (+22% last week +69% last month) and uptrending stocks with a significant short float causes squeezes, [explanation](https://stockstotrade.com/short-float/)

Market cap: 
I’ve done absolutely no research as to if this has any effect but it’s something I always look at when buying stocks in a new sector. Look at the market cap of its competitors. 

Zillow- 27b and 36b
Porchgroup- 1.72 billion 

So yea there is room for growth. It seems fucked but it’s worked for me in the past so fuck you.

38,Green Uranium....yes.,606,0.91,tsa004,"*****As always Do Your Research, this is not financial advise*****

We have a polar vortex affecting over 1 million square miles in the USA as of this week alone.

We also have a situation where energy demand is unable to be met with energy supply. Texas is a case in opportunity meets an urgent need. Texas depend on natural gas, oil and wind energy to provide power for millions of households. But what happens when the distribution network is unable to cope with demand for energy? We get rolling blackouts and a power grid that cannot sustain itself for prolonged periods of time.

We would need a stable and reliable energy source that can exist even during massive power spike demands. Uranium. One kilogram of uranium-235 can theoretically produce about 20 terajoules of energy (2×1013 joules), assuming complete fission; as much energy as 1.5 million kilograms (1,500 tonnes) of coal. The highest energy density material is Uranium. Since nuclear power involves no combustion, there are no byproducts of combustion to pollute the atmosphere.

Nuclear is a zero-emission clean energy source. It generates power through fission, which is the process of splitting uranium atoms to produce energy. The heat released by fission is used to create steam that spins a turbine to generate electricity without the harmful byproducts emitted by fossil fuels.

So what is the play? No not utilities. The miners. We already have several examples.

***But what’s also under valued? DNN.***

Denison Mines Corp. operates as a uranium exploration and development company in Canada. With over 1 billion in Market Cap. The company's Athabasca Basin exploration portfolio consists of numerous projects covering approximately 310,000 hectares. The current consensus among 7 polled investment analysts is to Buy stock in Denison Mines Corp. This rating has held steady since January, when it was unchanged from a Buy rating.

The all-time high Denison Mine Corp stock closing price was 27.03 on December 06, 2006. This frames how much value has been lost in years.

Financials have actually improved since 2018. And may actually come up with a profit this upcoming year.

The fact that the US energy sector is now prioritizing efficient green energy may be the biggest opportunity in decades when it comes to energy.

EDIT 1* 

Twenty nine states have at least one commercial nuclear reactor

Most U.S. commercial nuclear power reactors are located east of the Mississippi River. Illinois has more reactors than any state (11 reactors at 6 plants), and at the end of 2019, it had the largest total nuclear net summer electricity generation capacity at about 11,582 megawatts (MW). The Grand Gulf Nuclear Station in Port Gibson, Mississippi, has the largest U.S. nuclear reactor with an electricity generating capacity of about 1,400 MW. The two smallest operating reactors, each with a net summer generating capacity of about 520 MW, are at the Prairie Island nuclear plant in Red Wing, Minnesota. Two new nuclear reactors are under construction in Georgia, each with a planned electricity generation capacity of about 1,100 MW.

EDIT 2**

As of 2017, identified uranium reserves recoverable at US$130/kg were 6.14 million tons (compared to 5.72 million tons in 2015). At the rate of consumption in 2017, these reserves are sufficient for slightly over 130 years of supply.
- The U.S. is the world's largest producer of nuclear power, accounting for more than 30% of worldwide nuclear generation of electricity,

- Some 98 nuclear power plants in the U.S. remain in operation, although a few more are scheduled for retirement on the grounds of economics because of low-priced natural gas, but two new reactors are being completed in Georgia, and are on schedule and on budget,

- Following a 30-year period in which few new reactors were built in the U.S., it is expected that two more new units will come online soon after 2020; others resulting from 16 license applications made since mid-2007 are proposing to build 24 new nuclear reactors, most of which are of the new small modular reactor (SMR) designs,

- The first zero-emission credit programs have commenced, in New York, Illinois, and other states.

In predicting future energy needs, it’s important to know just how little U is needed to produce power in a nuclear reactor. A single U fuel pellet the size of a fingertip contains as much energy as 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas, 1,780 pounds of coal or 149 gallons of oil.

Each year, the United States consumes about

- 25,000 tons of U in generating 20% of our electricity,

- 624,000,000 tons of natural gas in generating 34% of our electricity,

- 750,000,000 tons of coal in generating 30% of our electricity,

- 1,000,000,000 tons of petroleum (7,200,000,000 barrels) to fuel our transportation sector, which contains the energy equivalent of 1,500,000,000 tons of coal.

EDIT3**********

Turns out DNN is also 15% owned by a Korean utility/ which is majority owned by the Korean government, ""known as KEPCO or Hanjeon, is the largest electric utility in South Korea, responsible for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and the development of electric power projects including those in nuclear power, wind power and coal. KEPCO is responsible for 93% of Korea's electricity generation. The South Korean government (directly and indirectly) owns a 51.11% share of KEPCO. 


KEPCO's involvement in the nuclear energy sector ranges from design and engineering of the nuclear power plant to nuclear fuel, commissioning and operation, maintenance and decommissioning. Construction of KEPCO nuclear power plants is undertaken by major Korean construction companies, while the manufacture of key elements of a nuclear power plant is done by companies including Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction and Westinghouse Electric Company.

In October 2020 KEPCO signed a memorandum of understanding with Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering to develop a floating nuclear power plant based on the BANDI-60 60 MWe small modular reactor, which has been under development since 2016. ""

***EDIT 4***
""Advanced Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are a key part of the Department’s goal to develop safe, clean, and affordable nuclear power options. The advanced SMRs currently under development in the United States represent a variety of sizes, technology options, capabilities, and deployment scenarios. These advanced reactors, envisioned to vary in size from tens of megawatts up to hundreds of megawatts, can be used for power generation, process heat, desalination, or other industrial uses. SMR designs may employ light water as a coolant or other non-light water coolants such as a gas, liquid metal, or molten salt.

Advanced SMRs offer many advantages, such as relatively small physical footprints, reduced capital investment, ability to be sited in locations not possible for larger nuclear plants, and provisions for incremental power additions. SMRs also offer distinct safeguards, security and nonproliferation advantages.""

39,"DD on SPG, a covid comeback story",18,0.71,TheHappyHawaiian,"I've posted about SPG before and have been riding it higher since October when it was in the mid 60s.  Today we closed at 110 which could be a near term top.  Recent upgrades from Morgan Stanley and others are point towards $125, but as long as mall traffic comes back post covid there's no reason SPG can't hit $150 or more given the market's valuations.

If you look at the chart it's been going up $20 at a time and then giving up half the gains like clockwork.  I expect we may get one more cycle of this before we get to the new price targets in the $125 range.

I've been holding April $105 calls and today I decided to sell March $110s against them to play the potential downside, and to be theta gang during the time this downturn takes.  Given the momentum we may just power higher, but with RSI pushing 80 its hard to see that happening without another outside catalyst of some kind.

Part of the reason I sold those calls was to raise cash to buy more silver plays

Geopolitical situation willing, I will have a Norwood type 1 hairline again. Only problem? You’ve gotta pay for the quality hairline you want. SO, your boy decided to go big again. 


Another Canadian play. Another solid gold play. One to hold and enjoy the divvies but also feeling safe that you’re in at price levels that existed before we wasted our time in the Middle East.


 That play? Suncor. TSE: SU, NYSE: SU


You may be thinking, wow this is some slow ass dino-stock that I can’t meme on. However, fatty gains are pretty much guaranteed.


Why?


1.	Everyone (see: moron analysts) thinks that oil is dead. These fuckers sit around in their downtown condos, wearing Patagonia sweater vests and thinking that just because they don’t drive their compact german executive car as often to mom’s house, that no one is driving at all. Take a look at the suburbs you hedgie-tard, take a look at ASEAN, Asia, Africa etc. People are going to driving their cars (we’ve sold 60 mil+ a year for years, almost all of those are gasoline powered). No one in these meme times can afford a Tesla or a BYD shit box unless you made money on gamestop. Yea I made 100% flipping gamestop in a day, hold my bags. China lays 8000km of highway a year, you’re not going to power that kind of growth with a fucking battery pack Elon.


2.	The Russian vaccine cannot be underestimated. It’s 91% effective for normal cases and 100% effective against severe and moderate cases according to a study from the Lancet. Russia now has this vaccine produced in South Korea, Mexico, Argentina, Pakistan etc. Only rich western countries can afford extended lockdowns, Russia has just liberated the developing worlds economies with a 10$ vaccine that can be stored in a fridge. For all intents and purposes, this pandemic is done. Russia has forced the hand of western supply chains if they want to make money. 


3.	Suncor has entered into agreements with Canadian government bodies to retrofit stations with EV charging ports. Suncor has >1800 stations in Canada. If they have to , they can easily pivot their stations into EV charging locations and with consumer presence of mind, everyone knows where their local petro Canada station is. Highly pivotable operations. Why would they let some eco-nerds start an EV charging chain on their soil? 


4.	There's nothing proprietary or mind blowing about EV charging companies, once the big boy gas companies step in, they're just going to install it in the stations that are already there.


5.	Good balance sheet, Warren buffet has been invested for a long time. But he bought the dip and recently sold his the shares he bought in 2020. He still has >13m shares, FMR bought about $500 million worth of Suncor in the last quarter. Strong free cash flow through gas stations (one place you can still go during the entire pandemic without masks, gloves or any requirements, been open for business this whole time).


6.	They can maintain dividends at WTI $35 according to their report, if WTI stays >55 this is a no brainer. Currently the market is pricing in about $55 wti so once the market prices in $60, on a DCF that makes the company worth $45.8B Canadian. 


7.	Geopolitics. Biden isn’t cancelling new drilling permits just because “DUDE SAVE THE PLANET MAN”. America not wasting its hydrocarbon stores is smart in case of a protracted conflict in the Pacific with China. Why ship oil in from the Saudis and Venezuela when you have a shit ton of shale safe in Texas. America is rich enough to have countries deplete their own reserves for America’s consumption and Canada is happy to help. The Keystone pipeline oil will just get shipped down on trains owned by Berkshire and Bill Gates (yea gates owns like 14% of CN rail and is the largest shareholder of that rail company, the more you know lol). The TMX pipeline is full steam ahead and will be completed by dec 2022. This completition will help shrink the gap between WCS and WTI and allow Canada to sell its oil all around the world. Suncor has committed to fill these pipes with its juice too.


8.	Our X-Factor. [This guy](https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FF2LGW7EAU5O5FUGMDLZKTFU4E.jpg) did a giant tour around India and ASEAN promoting Canadian business. What is Canadian business? Mostly natural resources and finance lol. We’re going to sell our Oil Sands through the port of BC to developing Asian nations around the world and help them gain energy independence from China. Canada standing by ready to help keep the free-world, free. You think this guy went around the pacific just for fun? 


9.	The last quarter showed great cost management and shows that Suncor is looking after shareholder interests. Shareholder interest in this sector are no  longer about growing production capacity but about delivering value to shareholder through dividends and buybacks. Management has already started buying back shares and its just a matter of time before they reinstate the dividend to .42 cents a share….every quarter LOL


10.	Hedge against inflation. We’ve printed a shit ton of dollars and now people want to tell me that a barrel of oil (148L of oil, equal to 20-30 gallons of gasoline and 10-20 gallons of diesel) should only cost $60 usd? $60 usd? I shit on $60. $60 wont even get a Saudi prince the paint on his tomahawk missles. Fuck off with this fake scam money, commodities serve a specified purpose and their value is derived from that. 


11.	Marko Kolanovic, a quant at JPM who LITERALLY called the bottom of the corona market dump says were entering a new oil “supercycle”. If someone that smart and connect says it, then you don’t even need to listen to me anymore. Suncor was trading at 40$ cad before this pandemic came around, and it will again.


For all you cr*pto-morons, here: SU-coin is a limited quantity e-coin that returns you .21 to .42 cents  a quarter and each day grows its proportional share of Canada’s second largest oil producer through management buying coins and destroying them. Wow so cool.

# What is Truforma

Zomedica's flagship product, TRUFORMA commercializes March 30th, 2021. TRUFORMA is a point-of-care machine that uses bulk acoustic waves (BAW) technology to detect & diagnose adrenal diseases (in dogs) and thyroid diseases (in dogs and cats). This compact machine delivers results in \~18 mins and carries 70+ global patents.  TRUFORMA does not require pre-market regulatory approval for use with companion animals in the United States.

# Major competitor

The current competition is IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ: $IDXX). It's worth noting that vets currently have to send off samples to these guys and not only is it expensive, but it causes delays in diagnosis (days). TRUFORMA allows for the same tests to take place, on-site at a fraction of the price within 18 minutes. Key members of the IDEXX team have left the company to join Zomedica.

# News and upcoming catalysts

Zomedica had 2 fantastic weeks, it's price is rising since they announced truforma will be launched at the end of March.

  When the stock price was at almost $3 they announced a *BOUGHT DEAL* to rise 173.5 millions dollars at $1.90 per share. Surprisingly this happened just 2 days ago and the price already recovered and is now around $2.55 per share.

  Zomedica announced that the money will be used to speed up the research and launch of new products.

  As of today Zomedica is **DEBT FREE**

  The upcoming financial annual report that will be published at the end of this month, the announcement of a new big potential investor who bought the offered shares, and certain news about Truforma when close to launch could really trigger an unprecedented rise of this stock.

  By investing today you could easily have a share worth up to $8 on product launch, or even double digits when they'll be announcing new incoming products and patents. This is a stock that has common sudden bull runs and a community of retailers who are expecting to hold their shares for years.

Tldr: This company has no flaws, it's backed by huge investors, has no debt, a lot of cash reserve, and just made a machine that in 18 minutes could tell if your dog/cat is a paper hand or diamond hand 🙌💎

# Fucking Chapter II

Today Zomedica announced the closing of the $173.5M bought deal; the money will be used to accelerate the development of their diagnostic equipment.

In the last DD i talked only about Truforma and many thought it’s the only product Zomedica will be offering.... Hooooooold up, i have great news for you.

Truforma on launch will be able to detect only a few diseases, but right now Zomedica disclosed it has more than 50 additional patents in the works, as u/Faraday27 said a myriad of new assays being formulated. If they manage to toss in cancer screenings and more basic rapid diagnostics such that the machine is a one-stop diagnostic shop, then they'll be an incredibly valuable company.

 Zomedica has added a new section to their website specifically for TRUFORMA called ""TRUFORMA Resource Center"" where they have added full documentation of their product, I read them and damn that machine may be able to tell if my girlfriend is a bitch (or is it me?) .

  
 

[This is an old photo of their product pipeline](https://preview.redd.it/f9e9cze6gwh61.png?width=1126&format=png&auto=webp&s=dba37481d2e48748d5beb8b08606b5237b262895)

As you can see Zomedica is just one of 8 products in the pipeline, their annual report is due in 10 days. This will give us a clear view of when to expect to see the new products. ZM-020 has a lot of potential right now, on Friday it came out that Zomedica filed a patent application for it, and apparently they hired the team that made the product in 2016 in the next image. Apparently testing this technology in a veterinary setting is the first step in bringing it to human use!

I want to respect your span of attention, so I'm going to keep it sweet and short. TL;DR at the bottom.

WSB has been flooded by $GME posts (rightfully) and Mia Khalifa tweets (please don't do that), so many of you probably missed the potential of $NOK and the good number of DDs that have been postes. So let me remind you in a nutshell:

1. **Space Travel 🚀🚀🚀**  
Yes, $NOK is litterally going to the moon to fix the Wi Fi there, so that (real) astronauts and space tourists can browse [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) at the speed of light.  
So why pour money on loss-making and extremely expensive stock of space exploration companies and not on $NOK? Spolier: no reason  
[https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)
2. **Relevance of the infrastructure business**  
$NOK is not a phone company. It is the **third** largest telecom-equipment manufacturer after Cisco and Huawei (yes, you heard that right. Just go to Wikipedia if you don't trust me).  
They just landed a juicy contract from Deutsche Telekom:

3. **Value of shares outstanding**  
Someone once posted ""ThEy HaVe 5 BiLliOn ShAreS FloAt hurr durr, the price is never going to move"". And the sheeps started copying/pasting this bulls\*\*t all over WSB. Please look at the **value** of the shares outstanding ($23B) and compare with, for example Palantir ($37B). Also, look at the huge condom-shaped spike during the meme frenzy. Are you sure the price is not going to move? Spoiler: the price is going to move very well.
4. **Consumer business in INDIA**  
This deserves many **🚀🚀🚀.** Nokia is building and selling air conditioners in India. Do you know what is one of the most popolous countries in the world? Yes, India. Do you know a country in which the middle class is about to 10x? Yes, India.  
This is their first step, I expect many more in the same direction.

5. **Short interest**  
I know you apes will love this. $NOK is still one of the most shorted stocks in the NYSE. But look carefully: A) short interest ios dropping sharply and B) the price is has never been lower in the last 5 years (excluding March Corona crash).  
This means shorts are covering because they know there is no more downside potential. Let's not give them the easy way out.

43,"The more I see everyone talking about the PLTR lockup expiration, the more I buy TODAY",276,0.78,heapsp,"a lockup expiration is a planned event. It is PRICED IN already. If it wasn't, folks could just simply print free money by buying PLTR puts the day before the lockup expires. 

Is this your first rodeo, you fucking retards? Do you honestly think that you are smarter than the market ? The lockup expiration will have no more of an effect on the stock price as 'oh its christmas time gamestop will sell more consoles!"" will have on their stock price. ITS PRICED IN ALREADY.

If it wasn't, people would just get rich by waiting for the days where lockups expire on publicly traded companies and make boatloads of money.

The fact that PLTR is less institutionally owned than most of its competitors means that this lockup period expiration is a great opportunity for the big guys to jump in.

UNCERTAINTLY drives DOWN stock price. My DD is simple. Without the uncertainty of exactly how many people will cash out their shares on Friday - the stock will rise like crazy.

Today is the best day to jump into PLTR. You have a healthy dip followed by very low IV (after earnings) meaning options are CHEAP AS FUCK. March $31 calls look especially juicy.

This is not financial advice, i am just another retard.

44,📈🚀 $BFLY is NOW listed on the Market 🚀📈,297,0.88,fortuneftb2329,"Welcome gentlemen, in the wake of all the new WSB members and World War: GME, I'd like to direct your attention to Butterfly Network **($BFLY)**. Due to all the hype around GME, AMC, NOK, etc, there has been little attention for the now-public company: Butterfly Network. 📈 🚀 (i hope mods don't take this down since this **isn't a SPAC anymore**)

# Intro to BFLY

Butterfly Network is an innovative digital health company that is working to enable universal access to superior medical imaging. They specifically work with Ultrasound Technology. Their plan is to continue creating ultrasounds that are affordable, have ease-of-use, and have mobility, all while meeting the needs of medical professionals and patients. 🚀 **Butterfly is also backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation** along with Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC, and **Cathie Wood from ARK Investment** Management LLC just to name a few investors 🚀.

The market for medical imaging is also HUGE! In fact, 2/3 of the world has no access to medical imaging as well 2/3 of diagnostic dilemmas can be solved/addressed by simple imaging. This may be one of the reasons why Butterfly has attracted investments from the Bill & Malinda Gates Foundation. However, Butterfly only has its products being sold in North America and Europe for the time being. Butterfly also plans to expand its amount of products to further increase revenue in the future. [Official Butterfly Investors Presentation](https://manual.butterflynetwork.com/Butterfly+Network+JPM.pdf) (Heavily recommend looking at this quick pres.)

Longview Acquisition was a Blank Check Company that focused on merging with private companies to bring them to the market and was the company to bring BFLY onto the market. LGVW also estimates to have $589 million in gross proceeds for Butterfly Network, which includes the $414 million in cash held by Longview. 📈 🚀 🚀 (rockets to keep your attention)

# Now on the Market

Butterfly Network & Longview Acquisition have now merged through a SPAC deal and came onto the market on Tuesday, Feb. 16, 2021 (Which is today at the time of writing). On Friday (Feb. 12, 2021) there was a shareholders meeting to announce the results of a stockholders' vote which had been occurring for the past month. Since BFLY is now trading in the market, the shareholder obviously approved it, not to mention a near 100% shareholder approval for the vote. -  [PR Newswire- BFLY Article](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/longview-acquisition-corp-stockholders-approve-business-combination-with-butterfly-network-inc-301227602.html)

[First Day of Trading](https://preview.redd.it/nfzz5i0o1wh61.jpg?width=664&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3f376fe163f98b3bb07b5819acf81160dfd89ff)

As seen in the image above, BFLY is currently trading around 22-23 dollars which is a slight drop from its premerger price of 23.05. Butterfly Network's merger is valued at 1.5 Billion dollars and as you see the current market cap is around 1B, this means it is somewhat undervalued as it's supposed to be 1.5 Billion. Although it isn't significantly undervalued, every bit of value counts and is also a bonus. [Investor Place- Things to know about Butterfly Merger](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/lgvw-stock-15-things-to-know-about-longview-capital-and-the-butterfly-spac-merger/#:~:text=Butterfly%20Network%20is%20a%20medical,and%20several%20other%20European%20countries).

If you've been investing during 2020, you might have noticed that SPACs and IPOs have been on fire, with Airbnb (ABNB) recently coming to the market with over DOUBLE its valuation due to the hype. I predict this same effect can happen to Butterfly Network. 📈 🚀

I dont know if y'all have heard but Texas is fucked right now cause of the power grid. ERCOT power prices have gone to $9k for the better part of the last 2 days. NRG (Reliant Energy) is the largest retail power supplier in the Texas (I think). Just gonna do some quick maths on hypothetical numbers for NRG power supply: They prolly need 25 Gigawatts/Hour for their clients right now. They had to pay $3k-9k per MW/HR, Chemistry conversion of Mega to Giga = 1000, so NRG is paying 6,000,000 \* 25 = $150M per hour to supply Texas right now. They probably hedged some of this and I think they also generate some power, but still, I don't think they hedged enough for this type of event.

$ABEV, Latin America + Canada subsidiary of AB InBev, is near an all-time low valuation currently.  Given the firm's HQ is in Sao Paulo, this makes sense.  The coronavirus is so bad in Brazil rn that hospitals are consistently running out of oxygen and are turning sick people away from their ER's unless they are literally on the brink of death... But this shitshow won't last forever (right?).

$ABEV has reported consistent net profits over the past several years and quarters.  The latest dip came as coronavirus cases ramped up in Brazil.  With the progress made on vaccine development and global distribution, I like the potential for this stock to rebound... a lot.  Did I mention this is the 3rd largest company by market cap in the southern hemisphere?  It also doesn't hurt having InBev as your daddy.  ABEV distributes brands like: corona, Budweiser, Modelo, Presidente, Pepsi, Gatorade, Lipton, and an assortment of other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  I'm in it for the calls.

50,A look at Dr. Michael Burry from The Big Short Scion Asset Management 13F which was filed just now.,113,0.88,_WinnerTakesAll_,"There is a lot to take in when looking at the portfolio of a genius contrarian value investor like Dr Burry. I have heard that a back-test of a model of investment based on his 13F filings would return about 65% annually. Don't quote me on that since I didn't do the test myself. 

I am going to focus on **his new positions**:

There is a lot of reasons not to sell something you already own but there is only one reason to buy something new; that is you are bullish. 

**Sector Analysis:**

Sector analysis of his portfolio shows that three of his new positions are in energy, three in finance, and three in consumer staples. 

\> The finance ones are mega caps: he is using these to get a baseline for his portfolio. Every portfolio needs some mega caps to smooth out the fluctuations. Financial companies saw a huge rally in January and I suspect these positions from Dec 2020 were in anticipation of January rally. I bought a lot of finance stocks at the same time. I've sold out already since easy gains were in January. 

\> Consumer staples were hot during covid lockdown. I think since those positions are from Dec 2020 that's why they are showing up on 13F. One of these was a call option which may point at the fact that it was a temporary position. 

\>Energy is the interesting part of his new positions. With oil rebounding the chatter on the street is that it offers great risk adjusted returns. Less oil will be burned for electricity production (some countries still do that). This will lift the whole Energy sector. We are seeing problems with the electricity grid which has no excess capacity. This is an Economy Reopening trade. With industrial production increasing demand for energy will increase and prices for industrial electricity will as well. The reason for this is majority of residential electricity costs are fix through government negotiated contracts and most the price fluctuation is channeled to the industrial sector. The fact that a lot of hedge funds are currently adding energy to their portfolio I expect this sector to outperform. 

**Deeper look:** 

Based on the sector analysis above and some other factors I decided to add two Energy positions to my portfolio. From the three energy companies he added, I Eliminated HollyFrontier due to negative sentiment on the street. 

**I added Now Inc and SunCoke.** I will focus the rest of my DD on Now Inc.

A look at **Now Inc:**

Valuation: Good

Financial Health: Good

Price momentum: Good

Sentiment: Good

What does it do? distributes downstream energy and industrial products for petroleum refining, chemical processing, LNG terminals, power generation, utilities, and industrial manufacturing operations.

Foreseeable News? Earnings call Feb 17th. 

What has been happening? Improving profit margins up until 2020. Current topline pressure. 

Bullish Catalysts? Increasing digitization and new skews added. Increase in Oil prices and investment.  

Safety Net? Zero Debt. Trading close to book value. 

**Disclaimer: This is my first take at the 13F, hence, some of the info above may be inaccurate. The timeline of this thesis is long-term hold.

51,"$BB Thoughts - Feb. 16, 2021",274,0.89,growthinvestor123," A few thoughts on the red this morning and collective hand wringing. While \~5% isn't a big dip (put on your big boy pants - It's really not), if you're like me and hold calls you're absolutely feeling the pain.

\#1 - We were optimistic that $BB had decoupled from the meme stocks, but it's unclear that that's fully the case. [Algorithmic / high-frequency trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc0oof/part_4_bb_no_meems_plus_gme_amc_nok_ties_that_bind/) can exacerbate sell-offs of particular baskets (and vice versa). Taken separately, one can see reasons for a dip for certain meme tickers but as of this writing every single WSB ticker of recent memory (NOK, AMC, GME, etc.) is down against a broader index that is green

\#2 - Oddly, the cynical here tend to be the naive. Do not succumb to the tin foil-itis. Short ladders generally don't exist. Hedge funds like to make money when stocks go up (or down) - They are not a monolith. The harsh truth is - The market is brutal and indifferent. Nobody's out to get you, because nobody cares. You make money or lose money by the dint of your ability and luck. And don't forget the luck.

\#3 - Newbie investors keep asking ""what to do"". If you are an investor rather than a trader (and there is a BIG difference) - There is only one question that matters, period. It's the question that should have driven your thinking about the stock when you bought it and when you decide to sell, and it's the question you should have in mind when you read the [news](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-jarvis-named-best-breed-160000731.html).

52,The Case for Cloudflare's Continued Growth,20,0.76,draco947,"# Why Cloudflare Is Positioned for Continued Strong Growth

The largest growth opportunity I see for Cloudflare within the next year  is  with Cloudflare One and Cloudflare for Teams offerings, as it really   fits a distributed workforce better than traditional VPN offerings.  The  pandemic has highlighed this issue for many companies, and I expect  to  see a lot of companies moving to modern offerings like this instead  of  relying on firewall appliances.

The second largest growth opportunity that I see potentially in the next   five years is the increased adoption of edge computing. Many established   companies are still getting into containerization and serverless   architecture. However, I expect to see a large increase in edge   computing being used for new platforms and microservices over the next   few years. I expect to see larger growth from slower moving companies   further down the road as older platforms are refactored and   re-architected to take advantage of new technology like this that   decouples the code from managing infrastructure.

There are a lot of competitors in the space. However, few offer the same   range of products, or the same level convenience and ease of setup and   operation that Cloudflare does. This makes it an easy transition for   many companies, while also allowing them to consolidate tools and   platforms into a single company.

**Some Other Highlights**

* Massive growth over the last two years - Beating expectations - Revenue rose  to  $125.9 million from $83.9 million in the year-ago quarter
* \~66% increase in stock price since IPO
* Companies with similar offerings range from \~$100-$200 per share
* Broad range of products that help companies consolidate multiple tools/platforms into a single platform
* Most Cloudflare services, like overall traffic, is not billed on usage, which keeps costs predictable
* Ease of use - Very easy to roll out quickly
* Low total cost of ownership
* Great customer service
* Focus on innovation - Tons of new products over the last two years
* Early to the Edge Computing space
* Provides value to free customers and the public
   * Free accounts with basic DDoS Protection
   * Cloudflare for Teams was free for quite a bit of 2020 to help in the pandemic
   * 1.1.1.1 private DNS Servers
   * Project Fair Shot
* %5-%10 of internet traffic goes through Cloudflare (as of 2018)
   * \~16% of Fortune 1,000 runs through Cloudflare

# Potential Downsides

Currently, Cloudflare is not profitable, but I believe it is getting close. I expect to see them profitable within a year or two. Their most recent report was a fourth-quarter loss of $34 million, but the adjusted loss was 2 cents per share vs 6 cents per share a year ago.

Edge   computing is still new. I don't see it being widely utilized in most   organizations for a few years, as it can require re-architecture. It's   easier for new platforms being written from the ground up or   micro-services being moved over to it.

# A Few Prominent Companies Who Use Cloudflare

* Discord - Yes, we hate them, they kicked us off, but we'd take them back. Right?
* Hubspot
* Zendesk
* OneTrust
* Panasonic
* Shopify
* AutoTrader
* Ivanti
* Udacity
* OkCupid
* Have I Been Pwned

**TLDR:**   This company has strong products and leadership. I expect Cloudflare to  hit $200+ per share within a year or two based on their growth, offerings, earnings, and comparable companies. This is a long play, so don't expect a moon rocket overnight.

Cloudflare is one of the few companies that I'm genuinely excited about. Some of   the products and updates they've made over the last two years have been   awesome.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll7zo1/the_case_for_cloudflares_continued_growth/,1613523048.0
53,TSM and the Global Automotive Semiconductor Shortage,130,0.91,jamseh,"If you haven't heard yet, there is a global semiconductor shortage that is hitting automotive companies pretty hard right now. Look it up and read about it.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-chip-shortage-ford-vw-gm-11613152294?mod=searchresults\_pos2&page=1](https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-chip-shortage-ford-vw-gm-11613152294?mod=searchresults_pos2&page=1)

Missing a $1 chip prevents automotive companies from releasing a $40,000 car. Ford and GM are curtailing production in their US plants due to the shortage and Americans are going out of work. This doesn't look good for anyone.

Why not just produce more automotive chips you might ask? Because producing automotive chips are not as profitable as producing chips for iPhones and gaming computers. Nvidia sells gaming processors for "" several hundred dollars apiece, whereas many of the microcontrollers used in the world’s automobiles can fetch a dollar or less.""

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-quick-fix-for-auto-chip-shortage-11612883643](https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-quick-fix-for-auto-chip-shortage-11612883643)

It is only profitable for companies to produce automotive chips if they can do so in large enough quantities, driving down costs of production and making profit possible. Economists call this *economies of scale.* This is what positions Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), the largest semiconductor foundry in the world, in a good place right now. TSM currently produces ""about 70% of the microcontroller units used in the world’s automobiles,"" and semiconductor companies which account for ""nearly 80% of the automotive chip market, all use TSMC for some of their manufacturing."" They are also best positioned to meet the shortage because they have the most infrastructure in place.

US Automotive companies are pressuring Biden to fix the shortage. The administration recently announced that they are looking into what ""immediate actions"" they can take and are "" working with allies to develop a coordinate response to the weaknesses and bottlenecks that are hurting American workers.""

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-working-to-address-chip-shortage-affecting-automakers-other-industries-11613066609?mod=searchresults\_pos2&page=1](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-administration-working-to-address-chip-shortage-affecting-automakers-other-industries-11613066609?mod=searchresults_pos2&page=1)

Any immediate action will have to involve TSM in some way. To manufacture the chips in the US would take years. TSM also has ties to the US as it recently announced plans to build a foundry in Arizona by 2024. I don't know exactly what form Biden's ""immediate action"" will take but I have a feeling it will be good for TSM's stock price in the coming weeks.

Aside from the automotive semiconductor shortage, TSM is a great play for other reasons. TSM's fundamentals are solid. TSM also produces AMD and Apple chips, and there are rumors that Intel might also begin outsourcing production to TSM.

TLDR: TSM is best positioned to gain from current automotive semiconductor shortage and prices could shoot up in coming weeks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll7xmx/tsm_and_the_global_automotive_semiconductor/,1613522889.0
54,The Rebirth of INTEL,62,0.7,Mycatiskoolerthanyou,"So let me start off with Financials and  production capabilities.

Intel out manufactures every other chip company by leaps and bounds. The only company coming remotely close is Samsung. Consequently INTC has more revenue than everyone else as well. INTC is slated for huge manufacturing production expansion programs ongoing.

INTC Revenue 2020 77.9 Billion

Samsung Revenue 2020  59 billion (USD)

TSMC Revenue 2020  18.50 Billion (USD)

AMD Revenue 2020  9.76 Billion

NVIDIA Revenue 2020  $2.21 billio

Back during the onset of covid, Bob Swan wrote a letter to the dod explaining the need for a DOD backed foundry plant in the US to combat China. The primary purpose is to build secure micro electronics under the complete auspices of the US military. This would cement INTEL as the defacto chip supplier for the US and its military allies. This also means labor would be subsidized in part by the DOD.

The ban on using Chinese companies  electronic devises where so strict  contracts where being threatened to being voided if there was a single Chinese built security camera. This means in order to combat china the US government has to back Intel's eventual dominance over Asia. Intel cannot fail. There have been increasing articles about Intel being Necessary to national security and continued US global dominance.

The second part I would like to bring up is Intel has a new CEO starting tomorrow. For those that want a sense of who he is, listen to Intel last earnings call [https://www.intc.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/8508/q4-2020-intel-corporation-earnings-conference-call](https://www.intc.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/8508/q4-2020-intel-corporation-earnings-conference-call) . The man has a PLAN. He studied under the greats of intel. Royce Moore and Grove, I'm pretty sure it was all 3 but I could be wrong. He rise through the ranks from technician to CTO. His rise was meteoric. He is the hope of Intel. He was shaping intel's culture in its heyday, he knows how to recreate the Intel of

The third point I would like to bring up is Intel recent purchase of Israeli company Habana Labs. They are producing a chip that allows machine learning to occur with GPU's at  faster speeds than NVIDIA can. (Disclaimer I might be misquoting the article and over simplified it) No one has been able to make a dent in Nvidia like this before. Not the article that I had in mind but here's one [https://newsroom.intel.com/news/aws-leverages-habana-gaudi-ai-processors/#gs.szvwf3](https://newsroom.intel.com/news/aws-leverages-habana-gaudi-ai-processors/#gs.szvwf3)

Its being built by TSMC allowing INTEL to compete in that market early.

Also to be covered is INTELS 

The last topic is the loss of product leadership. It matters.......to a point. How we classify our chips ie, 7nm 5nm and the like is kind of archaic. What actually matters is transistor density. It doesn't matter that you can build chips at 7 or 5nm and can't use all the space. Intel has a track record (sorry for using that phrase alot.) Of having a higher transistor density than its competitors.

but I couldn't find articles simple enough for me to understand to fully support or disprove this, so take it with a grain of salt. The second part of this is Intels manufacturing capabilities. Theres a shortage of Intels competitors chips. Tsmc can't build what amd needs to actually make a dent in intels revenue stream. The same goes for NVIDIA but imo to a lesser degree. The third part of this is the massive shortage of IC chips in general, in particular the auto industry. This means Intel will hit 70 within a few weeks for sure. This also means IMHO there's no end price target I could think of, I would gage, depending on how the new ceo behaves. Hopefully charismatic and daring. I love Intel and working here. I'm not giving investment advice, im just betting on a few hair brained ideas and the innovation and Indomitable spirit of the people I work with. You should see the grit and the ideas that are being sprung forth. Also for the simple fact we do not associate ourselves with forced labor in our supply chains (except TSMC) And in my opinion more change has happened recently in the last few months than the last few years. Bob Swan did great with what he knew how to do. He gave Intel cash and was the bad news bear so the new CEO could have a clean record. Tear me a new one guys tell me I'm autistic.

I lied..... Investor confidence is rising

56,Callaway ($ELY) DD,40,0.75,15Aggie2k,"**INTRO**

Hello! Below you can find my DD for Callaway Golf, $ELY.

Let's dig in.

**OVERVIEW**

Callaway is one of the leading names in the golf industry. They are a market leader in golf clubs, number two in golf balls, sponsor some of the largest names on the PGA tour, and tap into several revenue streams with golf equipment, clothing, and potentially recreation if their merger with Top Golf completes as is expected. While the stock low of $4.75 in March of 2020 has long passed, coupled with the recent all time high of $32.59 in February of 2021, this still profiles as a strong long-term hold stock in the coming years.

**WHY IS THIS A VALUE?**

In the [recent Callaway Earnings](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/zarvyiy6) Call in Feb 2021, board members including CEO Oliver ""Chip"" Brewer were ecstatic about the ""impressive growth"" golf has witnessed during the time period Covid screeched many other leisure outlets to a halt.

Callaway works to have something for golfers at every stage of the market. Their Strata series is often a go-to for newer golfers, with a durable, well made product tailored for those deciding if the hobby is fun enough for a larger investment.

There was a 41% increase YOY in 4Q for rounds played, contributing to the 14% overall increase during 2020 as a whole. Covid or not, people were golfing.

Looking at the balance sheet and cash flow, $ELE has seen a 108% increase from $303M in 2019 to $632M at the end of 2020 in available liquidity. They will use this to invest in multiple revenue streams including Top Golf which is covered below.

FY21 is expected to be around pre-covid numbers for gross margin as the brand continues improving from the pandemic. The company is also #1 in Hard Goods in both Japan and Europe, and is considered the #1 club brand in the U.S. It's golf ball trails shortly behind Titleist but still owns roughly 17% of the market, or 1-in-5 golfers.

**REVENUE STREAMS**

When those new golfers, coupled with the continued influx of baby boomers retiring are ready for their new and improved set of clubs, Callaway has top of the line products to provide across all revenue streams. Not only do they create premium drivers, irons, and putters (Odyssey), they also tap in with golf balls, leisure and outdoor clothing (Travis Mathew, Jack Wolfskin), performance apparel and training equipment. While Callaway and other golf retailers are confident in meeting demands, the industry itself is holding all time low levels of inventory. The game is booming.

The company saw a NON-GAAP 4Q increase of $14 million to $162M total, but this was due mainly to increasing employee pay, catering to increased demand of product, and working to prepare the launch of several revenue streams like Travis Mathew retail stores.

Callaway finds a customer committed to playing the game. Provides options for a starter set or top of the line clubs, clothing, golf balls, etc. and also sponsors several pros like Phil Mickelson and John Rahm to show you just what their product can do on the tour.

This level of synergy had CEO Brewer boasting in the recent earnings call about the ""Largest golf consumer ecosystem in the world.""

And that is all without mentioning the likely merger with Top Golf which will be voted on with likely success March 3.

**TOP GOLF MERGER**

What is [Top Golf](https://topgolf.com/us/)?

Imagine an arcade-style driving range where 50% of the customers do not even consider themselves golfers. It captures all demographics from enthusiasts of the game to the group of friends who want to drink at a bar while cranking some drives. It is home to Top Tracer technology which helps track golf shots and provides feedback. Top Golf installs these Top Tracer systems into hundreds of driving bays across the country on top of housing at Top Golf itself, providing monthly income to the company through renting the service.

With over 50 locations in operation across multiple countries, Callaway has been involved with Top Golf since 2006, owning 14% of the company. A merger was announced in October 2020 and is expected to be voted on and approved on March 3.

Top Golf itself is valued at around $2.5 Billion dollars, but carries with it around half a billion in debt. This appears to be of little concern to Callaway, who is flush with cash and sees the potential revenue streams created by owning a highly successful arcade driving range.

Equipment costs and inventory concerns will be lowered even further for Callaway as it can not only supply product used during Top Golf sessions, but sell products for consumers to take home if they decide to pick up the game on actual courses.

The earnings call mentioned the excitement surrounding the merger, but did not go heavily into financial details. They were very conservative with their outlook and worked hard not to speculate, especially considering the current pandemic and its issues. All that said, you can't understate the potential impact this will have on the company.

**INVENTORY**

Inventory is down overall across golf due to a ""robust demand"" across the total industry inventory. Inventory in the field for 5.2 months last year. 2.2 inventory this december 2020. Entire industry will ""be in chase mode, our inventory in the field is slightly below the industry average"" and is a ""reflection on unprecedented demand.""

Callaway is once again in a prime position to capitalize on this. The company has heavily invested in ecommerce, and is doing a fantastic job of capturing the digital market as well as the second hand club market with its website [CallawayPreOwned.com](https://callawaypreowned.com/)

With the addition of Top Tracer technology inside Callaway shops, more custom fitted clubs and less bulk inventory can be expected as well as Callaway capitalizes on the data to save money at the bottom line.

**COMPETITION**

Callaway's market cap is 2.82B despite a fairly low volume average of 1.8M per session. Acushnet (Titleist) is slightly higher at a 3B market cap, and Ping are among Callaway's competitors.

TaylorMade is another competitor of Callaway after being sold for $425M by Adidas in 2017. TaylorMade is up for sale once again and is [projected to be had for around $2 Billion dollars](https://thegolfnewsnet.com/ryan_ballengee/2021/02/02/taylormade-golf-up-for-sale-by-owner-kps-capital-partners-report-121878/).

For TaylorMade to X5 in Value over the course of a few years, it speaks to the potential that a long standing brand like Callaway brings to the table (and don't forget Top Golf!).

**STOCK ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION**

Obligatory mention that I am not a financial advisor. Do your own research. Not suggesting to buy literally anything at all.

After a quick look at the chart and using my background knowledge of golf, I felt that Callaway was a solid value at 28-30 bucks a share given where the game is now. This was before I learned of the pending Top Golf merger. Capturing that base of potential customers, selling equipment and clothing to existing customers, and access to the toptracer technology, this feels like an extremely strong long term investment.

Feel free to do your own digging for analysts you trust, I am not even linking them here to encourage that. From the areas I trust, as well as digging around I did elsewhere, this stock could see a few bucks in short term growth and really see some movement with a long term hold.

I personally own a position I plan to add on soon, but I do not intend to part with these shares for a couple years. I have gathered information I am comfortable investing with in shares and I am not confident in playing options at this time.

Please ask any questions in the comments as I have more info in my notebook that I haven't put into this DD.

TL;DR Won’t rocket and you can probably get in even cheaper if you watch it, but stock has promising long term (1+ year) growth.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll62vv/callaway_ely_dd/,1613517880.0

**A look at their** [**10-Q**](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000141157920000074/amc-20200930x10q.htm)

Let’s start with a look at their financial standing as of the end of September 2020. Obviously, a lot of things have happened since then and we’ll get to that later, but let’s first take a look at what their latest available financial position was to see how bad it was getting. Going through their 10-Q, here’s some of their Q3 highlights

* Income Statement
   * Revenue - 120M (-85% YoY)
   * Operating Expenses - 795M (-39% YoY)
   * Net Loss - 906M
* Balance Sheet
   * Cash & Equivalents - 418M
   * Current Assets - 609M
   * Total Assets - 10.9B
   * Current Liabilities - 1.59B
   * Total Liabilities - 13.2B
   * Total Equity (Deficit)  - (2.3B) deficit vs 1.2B equity in Q3 2019
* Cash Flows
   * Operations - (772M)
   * Investing - (155M)
   * Financing - 1.08B
      * Raised over 1B cash from senior bond issuances
   * Net Cash Increase - 153M
* Notes & Forward Guidance
   * Refinanced 87% of outstanding bonds for bonds due 2026 for higher-interest bonds w/ a principal reduction of 555M
   * Lenders have given relief from maintenance covenants in their bonds temporarily. Will need to increase cash flow or EBITDA back to a sufficient level by the end of March, when the relief ends, to be in compliance with the covenants or else the bondholders can make the bonds payable / due immediately, unless lenders agree to extend it
   * Cash burn = 388M during Q3
   * Expects rent to be drastically increased starting in 2021 due to expiration of rent deferrals
   * 600M in convertible debt to Silver Lake
   * (335M) EBITDA in Q3
   * **Expected to run out of cash by the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021, will require a sudden source of liquidity or increase in theatre attendance to not go bankrupt.**

**Recent Events**

The last point can basically sum up the important part of the 10-Q; that they’ve basically exhausted all possible sources of liquidity, and they would have most likely gone bankrupt some time early in 2021. They have a massive net deficit of 2.3B, which means that it would have been extremely likely that the shareholders would have been left with nothing in the case of bankruptcy. Even if their liquidity issues weren’t going to immediately force them to bankruptcy, their inability to meet their debt covenants when they expire at the end of March would have likely put them in default if lenders gave up hope and started cutting their losses.

All of this meant that literally every hedge fund analyst looking at this would have recommended their fund go short on AMC, since it seemed obvious that they were about to go bankrupt - the management even stated this in their most recent financial statements; this is why AMC ended up with a 39M / 57M of the float short (69% SI) at the end of 2020 - it seemed like the most obvious thing in the world, and AMC bottomed out at $1.91 when all seemed lost and the intrinsic value of the stock was $0 in every analyst’s mind.

Except, [as I’ve learned last year the hard way](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h945ly/dddd_retail_investors_bankruptcies_dark_pools_and/), even if all the fundamentals and financials point to an obvious bankruptcy is coming in the near term, it’s been a weird year and anything can happen. Specifically

1. [Silver Lake converted all of their $600M of debt](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-to-issue-444-million-shares-as-investors-opt-to-convert-600-million-of-convertible-debt-2021-01-28) to 44M shares during the AMC spike
2. It raised $917M in cash from debt and equity (165M shares issued)

Assuming the cash burn remained the same levels as Q3, which is the worst case scenario as states are much more likely to relax restrictions this year with vaccinations rolling out, this cash should last them all the way into Q4 2021. This also makes it much more likely that debt holders would extend their debt covenant waiver now that imminent bankruptcy is off the table. r/wallstreetbets **had effectively saved AMC from bankruptcy**.

**AMC Today**

With this background, there’s two mispricings that lends itself to a high-probability play.

1. As of Feb 12, AMC was at $5.59, which is barely double the share price of it back when they seemed to be approaching near-certain imminent bankruptcy in a few weeks
2. The Implied Volatility of put options are still extremely high based on the recent price action

Here’s some examples of the prices and IV of put options for AMC

[Feb 19 Puts](https://preview.redd.it/wkm8nscusuh61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=52bc0f459ac9d0a5c14587fe72733c727934c5c1)

[Mar 19 Puts](https://preview.redd.it/winpkfjusuh61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=cec5b9b71d92e5b16fbf06570e95ed833750d45a)

[Apr 16 Puts](https://preview.redd.it/pw5u741vsuh61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=712f8acdd7583d58db9f2de5478f3b42a0a9baff)

Furthermore, [as of 1/29 data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC/key-statistics?p=AMC), there’s still 38M shares short, meaning that not that many funds that were actually shorting AMC actually covered yet. Of course, because AMC was printing new shares like they’re JPowell to print themselves out of bankruptcy, the short interest went down to 15% of float, meaning it’ll be very unlikely to see another short squeeze.

**Thesis**

1. The stock is fundamentally undervalued at a market cap of $1.9B and share value of $5.50 (based on historical pricing; anyone doing an actual DCF analysis would say the equity is worth negative dollars because debt > EV). They were last at this price in late September, when there was uncertainty of their ability to survive another wave of lockdowns, and was $4.50 at late November, literally a month before they stated in their 10Q that they’ve already released that they would run out of cash and go bankrupt. Compared to this, it makes no sense for this stock to still be at $5.50 now that it’s extremely likely that AMC will not go bankrupt.
2. The Implied Volatility on the put side is insanely high, especially if you consider that AMC is likely undervalued, and hedge funds probably aren’t going to be adding additional shorts of AMC at this price, especially after seeing what happened to it a few weeks ago.

**The Play**

To take advantage of the mispricings, I’ve been short (i.e. write / sold) cash-covered puts on AMC on $5 and $6 strike prices for Feb, Mar, and Apr expiries since last week. Theta decay and a decreasing IV has caused the prices of these puts to go down substantially, but imo they’re still ridiculously overpriced. For example, to lose money on selling $5.50 puts expiring in a few days, AMC will need to go down to $5.15 (almost 10%). For March and April ATM puts, AMC would need to go below $4.50 to lose money, which is below the share price of AMC when bankruptcy was imminent. And if AMC stays above $5.50 by that time, you’d be making a healthy 21% return in 1 month.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll5mgc/dddd_why_i_still_like_amc/,1613516565.0
58,PLTR's Absolutely INSANE Capital Structure And Why It's Actually a Competitive Advantage. 🚀🚀🚀,702,0.83,BA_calls,"TL;DR: If you love America & money **buy the PLTR Dip**

Hey folks. I just read some of PLTR's actual S-1 filing with SEC which describes their multi-class capital structure and it's just pure bonkers:

[https://investors.palantir.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14399361](https://investors.palantir.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=14399361)

They created special ""Class F"" shares for the founders, such that the **total of all class F shares at all times have 49.99999% of the voting power of all outstanding shares**. This calculation is not static; these shares have ""variable"" voting power, meaning Founders can sell their shares without losing any voting power, however many shares they are left with then have 49.999999% of the voting power. And they can issue brand new shares as much as they want and it will never dilute their voting power.

This is absolutely unique and frankly a little crazy. To the point that the lawyers  felt the need to spell out the obvious in the prospectus:

>**Accordingly, our Founders will be able to achieve substantial liquidity in their holdings without diminishing their voting control.**

The trio could sell off their roughly 30% ownership down to 6% and still maintain full control of the company. What's more Class F shares are not transferable or inheritable. In case of the death of a Founder, the remaining voting rights are split amongst Founders who are still alive. Basically, Palantir is a fucking tontine between Karp, Thiel and Cohen. They've structured this in a way that they will control PLTR in perpetuity.

[Real-life photo of Peter Thiel with his voting rights.](https://preview.redd.it/zjdn74xq5uh61.jpg?width=944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c751b9cbd8506280b7b8c623ab60c3a226d528fb)

They appear to have crafted a way to get listed on the stock exchange while remaining privately controlled.

**Now why did they do this? And how could this be bullish?** It's all guesswork, but I think there is two parts to it. This little bit from the S-1, suggests a clue:

>Our relationships with government customers and customers that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, including organizations whose products or activities are or are perceived to be harmful, has resulted in public criticism, including from political and social activists, and unfavorable coverage in the media. **Activists have also engaged in public protests at our properties.** Activist criticism of our relationships with customers could potentially engender dissatisfaction among potential and existing customers, investors, and employees with how we address political and social concerns in our business activities. Conversely, being perceived as yielding to activism targeted at certain customers could damage our relationships with certain customers.

In 2019, [some liberals in Palo Alto protested Palantir's ICE contracts](https://www.businessinsider.com/palantir-protest-palo-alto-activists-ice-contracts-2019-8) for a hot second. Suffice to say, the Founders have political opinions that do not reflect those of social activists and likely a big portion of their employees. The class F shares immunizes the corporate leadership from ""yielding to activism"", as they put it.

However, the more important point is that, **PLTR is not non-political** per se. The corporation very much has opinions:

>***We do not work with the Chinese communist party and have chosen not to host our platforms in China, which may limit our growth prospects.***  
>  
>Our leadership believes that working with the Chinese communist party is inconsistent with our culture and mission. We do not consider any sales opportunities with the Chinese communist party, do not host our platforms in China, and impose limitations on access to our platforms in China in order to protect our intellectual property, to promote respect for and defend privacy and civil liberties protections, and to promote data security. Our decision to avoid this large potential market may limit our growth prospects and could adversely impact our business

And

>***We may not enter into relationships with potential customers if we consider their activities to be inconsistent with our organizational mission or values.***  
>  
>We generally do not enter into business with customers or governments whose positions or actions we consider inconsistent with **our mission to support Western liberal democracy and its strategic allies.**

This is very, very different from most of Wall Street, as most corps cannot help themselves from genuflecting before Xi. In many ways, excluding China is against the interests of shareholders who are there to make money. This would be unsustainable, without the unique capital structure that allows the founders to maintain the founding values of the corporation.

Now what the fuck am I saying, we're here to make money, not support Western liberal democracy. I make fun of the idiots who come here with ""iTs NoT aBoUt ThE MoNeY"".

The thing is, PLTR's primary customer is the US government, and I believe their ""mission to support Western liberal democracy"" is actually a selling point here and gives them a competitive advantage in the government contractor space. Especially in the defense sector.

That being said, Buying and Holding PLTR is essentially supporting Western liberal democracy, so:

59,Due Diligence on Burford Capital,None,0.47,Downvoted-4-truth,"**Due Diligence on BUR - Burford Capital - Litigation Finance**

Litigation  financing is an asset class that few have talked about here. It is,  however, very lucrative. Returns are lumpy but significant. The business  model is rather simple. Find someone with a claim, that (a) has little  money or is (b) risk averse. Have smart lawyers look at the case details  and evaluate the chances of winning the case (due diligence). If you  think you can win: offer to pay for his lawyers and costs. In return get  a share of the profits (usually 30% or more) if you win. Burford  Capital is the biggest player in this game.

I  believe BUR is significantly undervalued. I put my money where my mouth  is and have invested >100k. I will diamond hand this to USD 100+.

BUR  has been attacked by the Short Seller Muddy Waters in 2019. Using phony  made up scare tactics and the now well known ladder attacks, this has  tanked the shareprice. Following the attack, one of the bigger investors  in BUR (Neil Woodford) was forced to sell, further killing the sp.  However, the company has completely [refuted](https://www.burfordcapital.com/media-room/media-room-container/response-to-short-attack/)  the allegations and has brilliant prospects. I consider the risks to be  limited, especially since BUR has been deeply scrutenized before their  dual listing in the US in 2020.

While  the stock price has recovered a great deal, it is far from its all time  high of GBP 20 (=23 USD), currently trading at 9 USD. I think it can  reach its all time high quickly and go far beyond that. With Brexit and  Covid disrupting the economy, new legal cases will arise. This should  lead to an expanding client demand.

Hard  facts: P/E > 13; Price to Book: 1.06. Which is ridiculous based on a  cumulative historic ROIC of 88% (!). Those returns are completely  uncorrelated to the overall market (courts decide independent of  economy). The business model is hard to copy, as you need years of  market activity to convince lawyers that you are reliable. So there are  significant barriers to entry.

The  company has currently USD 820 million USD deployed in ongoing assets.  This is deployed in a large and diversified portfolio, the largest in  the industry, having many cases helps mitigating the risks of losing any  one case. It does not prevent you from losing cases, but on average,  you will win more cases than you lose.

There are realistic possibilities for an amazing ROI.

\-  The Peterson Case alone (that was already profitable for BUR bought at  20 million and already sold stakes in the case for 236 million,  retaining 61.25% of its original entitlement) has now entered a late  stage of the proceeding with the judge in NY being quite sympathetic to  BURs claim. That claim could be up to 13 billion, 61% of which would be 8  bn (6x the market cap). Anyone should invest on these grounds alone. I  have taken this bet, I believe that BUR has a > 50% chance of  winning.

\- VW and Trucks Cartel Cases have the potential of yielding USD 1.2 bn on a USD 30 million investment.

This  is quite legendary, especially knowing that all the other cases of BUR  (see graph attached) tend to win big. I think we have a winner here. The  Lit-Financing asset class is not well known, so investors should have a  great potential before the mainstream storms in.

I  think price to book should be at least 3. I can see the book value land  on USD 10 billion on invested capital. Market cap should be USD 30 bn.  219 million shares. Fair value USD 136 per share.

This is my personal opinion and not financial advice.

TL;DR: BUR should be worth USD 30 billion+.

* For whatever its worth, I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ivs6dw/bankrupting_institutional_investors_for_dummies/).

**I. Introduction**

* The commodities boom of the 2000s saw prices [balloon to incredible heights](https://i.imgur.com/gLQfQzn.png). Over a ten-year period, the price of iron ore rose from [~$12/ton to nearly $190/ton](https://i.imgur.com/ZYTveMH.png) as surging demand across the world drove unprecedented need for raw materials. The fun was cut short in 2008 due to the Financial Crisis, however government intervention saw to a [swift rebound](https://i.imgur.com/wle4DdR.png) in industrial activity. *(Chart data from World Steel)*

* If you’ve been watching the markets recently, you would have noticed a major rally among all the industrial metals. [Copper](https://i.imgur.com/U2QsNSr.png). [Iron Ore](https://i.imgur.com/nSzdE4p.png). [Nickel](https://i.imgur.com/ochvgTu.png). [Tin](https://i.imgur.com/lBr7RiM.png). This has been largely attributed to China’s quick recovery in 2020 as well as COVID related mining disruptions driving a mismatch between supply and demand. Heading into 2021, industrial metals have continued to rise as the rest of the world begins to come online after implementing policies designed to rejuvenate the economy. Other notable factors include: a strong US response leading to a weaker dollar and growing inflation concerns, a downturn in the services sector pushing consumers towards commodity intensive goods, and higher than ever global demand for large scale renewable infrastructure. All against a static, underinvested mining capacity owing to the [bearish environment](https://i.imgur.com/4dmwQmG.png) over the last ten years. 

* I believe the current environment has primed metals and other commodities to see prolonged, elevated demand not seen since the previous commodity supercycle as a strong resurgence in manufacturing precedes a long-term, worldwide push towards renewable energy infrastructure.

**II. Coronavirus & Government Intervention**

* The impact from the pandemic was far worse than the 2008 recession. A large-scale shutdown threw unemployment to the [stratosphere](https://i.imgur.com/3S0Gt56.png) and devastated the [markets](https://www.thebalance.com/fundamentals-of-the-2020-market-crash-4799950). The conditions were so poor it forced [governments around the world](https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19) to rapidly pass a series of heavy handed social and monetary policies – **note the US [absolutely jacked up the money supply](https://i.imgur.com/1vTd0GI.png) and [lowered rates to near zero](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/15/federal-reserve-slashes-interest-rates-zero-part-wide-ranging-emergency-intervention/)** – to revitalize the economy and prevent further deterioration. 

* The impact wasn’t just limited to consumers, businesses also felt the pressure as many manufacturers – expecting lower demand – [cut back on production and capacity]( https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/coronavirus-impacts-industrial-manufacturing.html#content-free-1-6e9a) as the commercial sector saw activity grind to a sharp stop. Miners, anticipating a period of economic weakness, not only sharply cut back production but also saw [severe disruptions](https://www.mining.com/worldwide-mining-disruptions/) across mining sites as COVID breakouts forced projects into suspension. 

* Note that the sheer amount of financial support in 2020 far outstripped the [government response in 2008](https://i.imgur.com/TMs02Ot.png). The [$2T legislation in March](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/stimulus-package-details-coronavirus/index.html) was followed with [$900B in December](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/20/politics/second-covid-stimulus-package-details/index.html) and President Biden has promised [another $1.9T proposal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/01/14/biden-stimulus-covid-relief/) and [$2T infrastructure proposal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/02/11/biden-senators-infrastructure/).

**III. Industrial Demand**

* Due to their rigid response to the pandemic, China led the world recovery, with the rest of the world not far off, driving an early surge in commodity demand and sending metals prices soaring. With the services market almost entirely shut down, buyers had turned to more [commodity intensive goods](https://www.wsj.com/articles/factories-bounce-back-as-consumers-snap-up-goods-11604315271) and [overwhelmed the markets](https://theloadstar.com/its-a-juggling-act-say-handlers-as-cargo-congestion-swamps-europes-airports/). Unexpected consumer demand drained inventories and manufacturers found themselves with record setting backlogs. This shift was further supported by the government’s stimulus programs, actively adding spending power to the consumer class.

* For some time now, there has been growing focus around renewable energy infrastructure and green policies. Current trends have pushed back against [new investment into coal](https://i.imgur.com/xDiza5H.png) and [Oil & Gas](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/28/joe-biden-keystone-pipeline-climate-crisis) and [numerous](https://i.imgur.com/VweHRwA.png) [countries](https://i.imgur.com/vZRsX4o.png) [have](https://i.imgur.com/16DSmh2.png) announced environmental targets. Renewable investments have been highly profitable with [studies stating](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2020/05/28/just-how-good-an-investment-is-renewable-energy-new-study-reveals-all/?sh=7b9d17194d27) that renewables investments in Germany and France yielded returns of 178.2% over a five year period, compared with -20.7% for fossil fuel investments. [The International Renewable Energy Agency](https://www.irena.org/financeinvestment/Investment-Needs#:~:text=In%20its%20latest%20analysis%2C%20Global,in%20the%202016%2D2050%20period) stated the world would require an additional $27T in infrastructure spending from 2016-2050 fulfill the objects of the Paris Agreement. Annual renewable investments in 2018 would have needed to [double](https://i.imgur.com/aKqAwSh.png) to be on track to meet targets and **[Goldman Sachs believes that the capital expenditure cycle could rival the 2000s](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-supercycle-ahome-idUSKBN29A1QM).** 

* China has announced they expect [higher steel demand](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-steel-idUSL1N2K204Z) vs last year. [Economists now see US-China GDP parity in 2028 from 2033](https://i.imgur.com/OOkc7mO.png). Both the US and China are looking to upset one another and it’s hard to see demand slacking with [two world powers competing](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56036245) to achieve faster greenification and out-GDP the other. Note that [India](https://i.imgur.com/coaL6YG.png) joined the infrastructure bandwagon last year and continued to emphasize infrastructure in their [latest budget](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/india-budget-health-care-infrastructure-and-fiscal-deficit.html). Countries have begun to launch major projects to meet their targets or as a tool to generate economic activity. [South Korea](https://www.power-technology.com/news/south-korea-plans-build-43bn-offshore-wind-farm/). [Scotland](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=d4355db2-3036-4450-b2a0-611a56d944bf). [EU](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-leaders-close-in-on-coronavirus-recovery-plan-deal-11595274568). [Canada](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-transit-fund-1.5908346). [Higher iron ore imports](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/iron-ore-imports-outside-china-show-signs-of-recovery-russell).

* Furthermore, EVs will require significant resources for new factories, batteries, and cars. This demand is already noticeable on [Nickel](https://i.imgur.com/ochvgTu.png) and analysts have increasingly raised their [projections](https://www.mining.com/nickel-demand-for-evs-expected-to-shoot-up-in-the-next-20-years/) on the metal. Ford even admits [here](https://www.mining.com/web/ford-joins-global-initiative-to-promote-responsible-mining/) they will be more reliant on mined material going forward. [These guys will probably need more metals too](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-15/tesla-to-start-making-cars-in-india-targeting-sprawling-market).

* Global construction is looking at a [record growth](https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/economic/2021/02/global-market-scan-2021-a-year-of-recovery-and-reacceleration-in-global-construction) for the year. Additionally, expanding the sector is a way for governments to have an immediate effect on [employment](https://i.imgur.com/JnbiYUS.png) and thus the economy. [BCG](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/infrastructure-stimulus-in-covid-pandemic-recovery-and-beyond)

* Lastly, the most recent [ISM](https://www.ismworld.org/globalassets/pub/research-and-surveys/rob/pmi/rob202102pmi.pdf) manufacturing index has continued to point towards growth with low inventory, high backlog, and overall bullish outlook on economic activity.  [Btw](https://i.imgur.com/6oK8as7.png) 

**IV. Financial Demand**

* The government’s expansionary monetary policies were successful in staving off further deterioration, however this resulted in extremely low interest rates across the world as well as a sharp increase in the money supply. [The DXY has weakened](https://i.imgur.com/JC9Yylb.png) starting in March 2020 and [current consensus](https://currency.com/usd-forecast-2021#:~:text=US%20dollar%20news%3A%20more%20pain%20ahead&text=Setting%20out%20its%20USD%20forecast,against%20most%20major%20fiat%20currencies.) is that it will further devalue as the Biden administration implements the $1.9T stimulus and $2.0T infrastructure proposals. The massive printing [heightened inflation concerns](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-13/inflation-is-coming-to-the-u-s-and-the-fed-could-be-in-a-bind) and the demand for hedges such as metals. Furthermore, a [low dollar](https://www.thebalance.com/how-the-dollar-impacts-commodity-prices-809294) raises the buying power of foreign currency and [low rates](https://www.thebalance.com/commodity-prices-when-interest-rates-rise-4084273) ease capital for companies; both are economically linked to higher commodity prices.

* Alongside the economic machinations at play, major financial institutions such as [Goldman Sachs](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-metals-supercycle-ahome-idUSKBN29A1QM) and [JPMorgan](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-fifth-commodity-supercycle-has-started-says-highly-regarded-jpmorgan-strategist-11613044794) have announced they see the beginnings of a commodity supercycle with some forecasts seeing iron ore as high as [$165/t for three years]( https://www.mining.com/iron-ore-price-jumps-as-vale-reports-low-output/) as others upgrade their projections on [steel](https://i.imgur.com/FuUtHLj.png). Not all metal demand is strictly industrial and trader demand for these metals for speculation and inflation hedging purposes are likely to further increase.

* PS. [This was JPMorgan just a little while ago](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/jpmorgan-defends-its-call-on-metal-trades-after-investor-backlash.html) 

**V. Commodities, Metals, and Mines** 

* The March contraction reversed at breakneck pace to a bullish narrative as all indicators pivoted towards prolonged, stronger economic activity. Government policies have bolstered the consumer class with direct payments, weakening the US dollar and driving inflation concerns, as the world powers race towards renewable infrastructure to jump start their economies. With service businesses suppressed with social restrictions, consumer demand has shifted towards commodity heavier goods resulting in manufacturers with low inventory, high backlogs, and rising raw material costs. Renewable infrastructure will remain a long term driver for capital expenditure as the US and China gear up for economic superiority while other major nations look to meet their own environmental pledges. 

* All these demand drivers are expected to be significantly accretive to metals and metals producers. Metals prices are soaring and are expected to remain elevated for some time both on continued market demand as well as the devaluation of the US dollar under the government’s upcoming spending agenda. The markets – on near zero interest rates – are still unwinding the last two major stimulus bills from March and December and the Biden administration has an additional $1.9T and $2.0T planned with potentially more support even after that. **Miners, aware of the impending inflection point, have already pledged to intensify cash distribution to shareholders.** $MT announced [$650M +$570M buyback](https://corporate.arcelormittal.com/media/press-releases/arcelormittal-announces-share-buyback-program-3) and issued $0.30 dividends. $FCX announced a [performance based buyback policy alongside a cash dividend of $0.30/share](https://investors.fcx.com/investors/news-releases/news-release-details/2021/Freeport-McMoRan-Announces-Reinstatement-of-Common-Stock-Dividend-and-Adoption-of-Performance-Based-Payout-Policy/default.aspx).

* Mines have traditionally been heavily slow businesses with lead times for construction to full production as long as [8 years](https://www.extractiveshub.org/topic/view/id/21/chapterId/268). While the jump from 2008-2010 came off a strong bull cycle with many mines already well into capacity expansion and new projects, 2020 has come off one of mining’s worst downcycles with weak capacity investments as miners opted to scale down from preexisting operations. In fact, 2020 saw production of [iron ore](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-iron-ore.pdf), [copper](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-copper.pdf), and [nickel](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-nickel.pdf) all flat to lower versus last year. Current miners can tap deeper into current capacity to produce at higher output, however there will be no major development in new capacity at least for the near term until metals prices rise high enough to attract significant new investments into the sector. Given high enough demand, a supply bottleneck is a very real possibility.

**VI. Conclusion**

* The pandemic induced recession was far worse than any previous downturn and it required a heavy handed government response to stabilize the economy. The economic recovery is gaining momentum each day and the commodity landscape is primed for further growth as nations increasingly invest in infrastructure and the US dollar continues to weaken. Both JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs stated they see the beginnings of the next commodity supercycle and the US has yet to deploy nearly $4T in stimulus and infrastructure. Renewable infrastructure has shown strong rate of returns and IRENA stated countries must double their annual infrastructure investment to remain on track to meet pledged targets. Additionally, the US-China standoff has transitioned into an economic competition over EVs and renewable infrastructure.

* Metals prices and miners are set to benefit immensely as major demand drivers act on constrained underinvested capacity due to a decade of bearish market activity. These companies have pledged to funnel large portions of their newfound profits to shareholders through increased dividends and sizable buyback programs. The most recent $900B stimulus in December has yet to fully unwind, we have yet to see the impact of Biden’s $1.9T stimulus and $2.0T infrastructure policy, and concerns around inflation have never been higher. All factors point towards heightened economic activity and heightened financial demand. Inflation, market demand, and short supply all combined; I see considerable upside for commodities, metals, and miners well into the future.

61,Why Shell (RDSA) is undervalued,122,0.75,UnBonCitoyen,"First of all, yes this is a boomer stock but I like money.

So you're probably wondering why I'm writing about this stock and why it is undervalued right now (in my opinion). Let me point out the following things:

First of all, Brent oil is at a 12-month high and will even go higher ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/oil-refineries-shut-as-texas-energy-industry-reels-from-deep-freeze.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/15/oil-refineries-shut-as-texas-energy-industry-reels-from-deep-freeze.html)). The supply shrinks but the demand grows, refineries are closing due the cold weather (aka we're turning up the heat to keep ourselves warm). Shell has a break even price at $31, so with the current Brent price ($63) they are making $32 per barrel!!!

Secondly, there is still a lot of air traffic ([https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/travel/coronavirus-air-cargo-capacity](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/travel/coronavirus-air-cargo-capacity)) and once the pandemic is over, there will be even more commercial flights.

Shell is producing synthetic kerosene!!! This is a huge one, I'm surprised that this isn't getting more attention ([https://www.flightglobal.com/fleets/klm-carries-out-first-flight-part-powered-with-sustainable-synthetic-fuel/142326.article](https://www.flightglobal.com/fleets/klm-carries-out-first-flight-part-powered-with-sustainable-synthetic-fuel/142326.article)). Shell is focusing on their emission neutral transition, they have a bright future ([https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-shell-emissions/shell-sets-emission-ambition-of-net-zero-by-2050-with-customer-help-idUKKCN21Y0MN](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-shell-emissions/shell-sets-emission-ambition-of-net-zero-by-2050-with-customer-help-idUKKCN21Y0MN))

Lastly, Shell also sells natural gas, which is also peaking ([https://finance.yahoo.com/m/19dabc60-9034-3569-a096-4802b26cffa4/natural-gas-prices-soar-amid.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/19dabc60-9034-3569-a096-4802b26cffa4/natural-gas-prices-soar-amid.html)).

Bonus: 18th February is the ex-dividend date aka if you have shares at opening, you get a dividend.

So why is Shell's stock price so low? Negative sentiment, completely retarded people thought that they will go bankrupt because of the pandemic. Others are saying that we won't need oil and that green energy is sufficient... delusional lmao.

The real reasonable reason: the dividend cut they have done, this helps them to pay off their debt. BUT they will raise every quarter the dividend with 4% (or more). There is a big possibility of a share buy back when their debt goes below 65 billion, which might be very soon with these insanely growing oil prices.

TLDR: Oil up, Shell up

Undervalued, low risk, good reward.

positions: 467 @ 16.28 (European market)

62,Playing The Market Fvckery... Pt. 3... playing the etf game for gee eeemeeeeeee,2215,0.93,misium500,"This one is very theoretical. If you don't know what Im talking about please research this or reread this.

Okay, we know the heavily shorted stock mentioned came off the Threshold list on Feb 3rd. That means they covered almost all of their FTD's (faild to deliver). Many of these were bought in the open market at high prices, however many people have speculated that it doesn't seem to be enough. The market Volume was very low and the sellers to buyers ratio was also very low. could that be enough? They were on the threshold list for 39 days straight and they covered it all in just a few days? Maybe. But what if it wasn't enough? Where did they get the rest of the shares they needed? Remember, if they don't deliver in 13 days after the 3 day settlement period is up, then they lose the right to short sell forever. That is why they have to buy at the higher prices and that is the main reason, along with the hype, that the stock price spiked. 

Now lets introduce another player into the game called the etfs.  There are several ETF's that have the geemee stock as part of their portfolio. I have only looked at one. you can  check out the other ones  too. Apparently there are 79 ETF's which hold the stock.  I checked out ex are tee. Their chart looks very similar to the chart of  the stock mentioned And it is one of their main stocks that make up part of their fund. Maybe Coincidence? 

Now, the etf went ON the threshold list on January  29th and has remained there to this very day! IT did not appear on the securities threshold list a single day this year before jan 29th That is the same day that the the short sellers supposedly covered most of their short positions and the geemee spike started to drop as well as about the same time the brokers stopped letting people trade!  This etf currently sits at 190% short float. Peaking on 2/1 at over 800% short float!  As of 11feb2021, they also only hold 454,595 shares(3.36% of the fund) of the mentiopned stock, coming down from a high of roughly 19%.

 

[outstanding shares of the etf](https://preview.redd.it/fcfu9kpisth61.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5484039e4707243d234da8a633f8f5c3af844e1)

&#x200B;

[Shares shorted of the etf](https://preview.redd.it/b6aalo74sth61.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=98c590c3113485e44c1839fe748be0918f582c17)

 There is a possibility that  the ETF's that had shares of geemeee were used to cover the failed short positions so that it would come off the threshold list. This would create the image that the opportunity is over, however then  the ETF's involved would be now in the exact same position that the stock was in just before the spike. This would  just move the crisis from one place to another. 

This procedure can be mainly done by naked shorting the stock.  If a manager wants to short a single stock, but they don't want to go to the extent of borrowing and disclosing the short, they would short an ETF that holds the stock, and simultaneously buy long the underlying holdings that they don't want to short. This Naked shorting ETFs is generally acceptable due to arbitrage, but if one goes long on the remainder of the holdings (not many in the mentioned etf), one can naked short the stock without doing any arbitrage on the ETF. This, when coupled with synthetic longs via options, gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't, takes the heavily shorted stock off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be, and provides the ability to naked short the stock again.

&#x200B;

[Comparison of the ETF short positions and the underlying stock](https://preview.redd.it/hrg8gx2lrth61.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=01cba928637efebe0e584c2796ea04e46bd52056)

 This is a likely scenario how geemeee could actually be shorted without appearing so. This solves the NYSE threshold securities issue and the ability to drive the stock down outside of buying puts. Theres list of etfs holding this stock. They can all be used in the same way. Thats a theory right now. All figures indicated that the % of shorts went down without any real price movement that should have reflected this. This would be the explanation.

For all the retards rubbing their hands now: It's very unlikely to squeeze an ETF because managers will just buy more shares of the underlying and issue more shares of the ETF. They don't need shareholder approval or prior announcement to issue new shares as do single companies. And other banks and funds can buy shares of the underlying and create more shares of the ETF themselves as APs. 

 I am not a professional.. I am not advocating any action on the part of anyone else when it comes to buying, selling, or holding stocks. I didn't mention any ticker. You should also not mention any ticker in the comments. You are responsible for your own actions in the stock market. 

Let's see what will happen in part 4.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll26ij/playing_the_market_fvckery_pt_3_playing_the_etf/,1613504830.0
63,Why TLRY is still a great move,270,0.78,cailebs,"Disclaimer: I've been in **$TLRY** since $11 so I might be biased but have been trading weeklies / holding leaps since I flipped the first weekly profits. Price popped to $60+ mid last week and is sitting back around $30 now. There's a couple reasons I'm not selling until later:

&#x200B;

**Earnings tomorrow.** February 17th after hours. After $APHA earnings recently they didn't do insanely well, but they beat expectations. $TLRY and $APHA both shot up right after that. If $TLRY beats tomorrow, I could see something similar happening even though price is still up a large amount.

&#x200B;

The **merger with $APHA** has been a big catalyst recently and is set to happen in Q2. This will make Aphria and Tilray the biggest cannabis company in the world by revenue. Together they will be able to grow even faster than now.

&#x200B;

I guarantee they will talk about the merger tomorrow in the earnings meeting, and I feel like we will get some positive hype from what they say.

&#x200B;

**TLRY announces contacts in France, Portugal, Spain, and the U.K. very recently.** Here's the global reach map from Tilray's website:

[Tilray Global Reach Map](https://preview.redd.it/4z4ywhn9hth61.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=2530afb0b698eab032df6be25c3cf65a47770919)

As you can see they're already pretty fucking well spread out. With the addition of APHA as well as APHA buying Sweetwater in the US, they'll already be established in the USA and be able to enter the market easier if we can ever get to decrim/legalization.

&#x200B;

**2021 legalization hopes.** Kind of reminds me of the market pumping on stimmy hopes. With the dems taking over I say we have a better chance. Even if some states pass additional bills all weed stocks could see a pump. There are a number of states with bills that are already in the works in a few states.

[Most recent 5 press released from Tilray's site](https://preview.redd.it/8vpue77djth61.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=7adf72476d7c26f222dfb062721f71cad39c6c20)

I don't know what better news you could ask for from a cannabis company. Big milestones, and creating big opportunities for them in different markets.

Another interesting thing with Tilray is the **price difference with $APHA.** This is important to note because  *""Under terms of the agreement, Aphria shareholders will receive 0.8381 shares of Tilray for each Aphria common share, a 23% premium to Tilrays.""*

$APHA at the time of this post currently is **$18.35, and $TLRY is $30.19.** That basically means Aphria is trading at about 60% of Tilray's price. I bet as we get closer to the merger, price will get closer to that .83 area. That means Tilray either has to come down more / Aphria will have to come up to meet in the middle.

The **short interest** has definitely changed recently as well, and a lot of fake numbers have been thrown around. With the whole $GME deal anything with short interest and a little WSB spice has been getting pumped.  Since $TLRY already did it in 2018, it's not wild to say it can do it again. Already saw a a huge pump, but I don't think it's over.

&#x200B;

That's about it. Had $480 in account on January 6th, now sitting at like 24k. Popped above 60k last week. I have diamond hands tho. Majority of $ in $30, $55, $60c leaps for Tilray that I got a while ago. I also have about 20% in $AG because I'm bullish on silver. Posted some screens on account for you ""gimme proof"" fuckers. Good luck to all.

&#x200B;

If you got some counters as to why I'm just 100% off on this, shoot them at me

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** Buy Tilray and Aphria

64,Blackrock is holding a huge put position on SPY going into the new year.🐻,63,0.69,I_sell_FDs,"TLDR: Read the title

If you follow my comments, I've been pretty bearish lately so I'm obviously always looking for my daily dose of confirmation basis. Blackrock is still overall bullish on the market and took a HUGE position on TSLA, I've also seen companies switch from bonds to shares of TSLA recently which may speak to a continuation.

Even though their call position on SPY is still larger than their put position, they increased their hedge by 12000% (basically nonexistent to very tangible) while their call position only increased a comparatively modest 52%

The Bill and Melinda Fund has retreated a bit from the market, they withdrew a sizable portion of their positions and only bought one stock, schrodinger Inc.

I haven't had time to look into more firms due to work, but I wanted to share this information with anyone who might be overly bullish. Keep a little cash on the sideline, don't overexpose yourself with margin, and if there is a major correction, please know that long $ROPE isn't worth it. There will always be another bull market to run up.

65,I am going to short the whole country of South Africa.,40332,0.8,The-Crazed-Crusader,"I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.

Under the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.

That is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.

Edit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.

I first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA ([EZA](https://www.bing.com/search?q=eza+stock&cvid=0d411debffed4d50b06fa54733b0bb0a&FORM=ANAB01&PC=DCTS)) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.

My new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the [South African Rand's inflation](https://www.inflationtool.com/south-african-rand) was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for SA to implode.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkzviy/i_am_going_to_short_the_whole_country_of_south/,1613494449.0
66,Why everyone is wrong about Vaxart—Medical opinion,73,0.72,aodh_the_fallen,"# Ticker: VXRT

# TL;DR

**Moderna and Pfizer lack a key aspect of the immune response the absence of which will help to enable continued transmission and, thus, mutation of the virus; Vaxart and Altimmune are most likely to be effective in targeting this component of the immune system that all COVID vaccines to-date fail to mount. Media coverage on these topics has been overwhelmingly misinformed so far, though this could easily and rapidly change.**

Analyst price target: $16 (+100% upside)  
Personal price target: $21 (+170% upside)

# INTRO

I am a soon-to-be resident physician wrapping up my studies at an American allopathic medical school. **My goal is to explain in simple language why I feel the market is wrong about Vaxart—as it repeatedly demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of medicine and vaccine science—so that you can better understand and, in turn, make more informed investment decisions.** I am not trying to give you investment advice; I am trying to give you greater understanding. I am not trying to make Vaxart the next Gamestop; I am trying to bring light to misunderstanding. With that said, I will disclose upfront that I actively trade not only VXRT but also PFE, MRNA, NVAX, ALT, SRNE, and TGTX. **Do your own research, come to your own conclusions, and make your own decisions. Your decision to invest in Vaxart makes no difference to me.**

Questions are welcome. Assholes are tedious and almost always misinformed. **Actually check the sources before telling me I did not provide it.** This is all very generalized and greatly simplified and there are no absolutes in medicine. **Simplicity of language and accessibility of information is the goal here.** Everything below is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and supported by the current state of science as we know it.

# VERY BRIEF HISTORY

Vaxart is making an oral COVID-19 vaccine. A few weeks ago, the stock price of Vaxart rapidly went up before sharply falling following the release of “positive” preliminary phase 1 clinical trial data. Why? Because their release stated that no “serum neutralizing antibodies” were produced, which the market apparently—and quite incorrectly—took as an indication of failure. Fortunately for me, the market does not understand immunology. I have owned shares of Vaxart for a few months now. I was watching (and holding) as the stock price rapidly increased a few weeks ago. As the stock price rapidly dropped, I bought more. When it dropped even further, I bought even more. Why? Because (1) Serum neutralizing antibodies were never Vaxart’s selling point for me, and (2) Vaxart has what Moderna and Pfizer will literally *never* have: The key needed to achieve herd immunity. (Hold that thought.)

# IMMUNOLOGY BASICS

“Immunoglobulins” (abbreviate “Ig”) are the “antibody” molecules our immune system makes to keep bugs at bay. There are 4 primary immunoglobulins: IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE. When a bug is swimming around in your blood, your immune system quickly makes IgM. If that bug won’t leave you alone, your immune system will “level up” and transition to making IgG instead. This transition from IgM to IgG usually takes at least a few weeks. If that bug leaves but then bothers you later in life, your body will remember where it left off and quickly make an even stronger IgG for you. IgA is quite different because it hangs out in all the “sticky” places of your body referred to as the “mucosa”—your nose, mouth, throat, stomach, intestines, anus, penis, vagina, and even the milk ducts of your nipples. When a baby is born, mom can give the baby IgG through the womb and IgA through her milk. This keeps babies alive while their tiny immune systems are growing up and becoming independent. (We can ignore IgE for this discussion.) These immunoglobulins/antibodies have a few weapons in their arsenal to use against bugs: The bugs can be labeled as an enemy for our allies to then attack, the bugs can be stabbed to death, or the bugs can be quarantined in a little box so that they can’t hurt you. In fact, “neutralizing antibodies” essentially quarantine bugs so that they can’t do any harm. When we say “serum neutralizing antibodies” we usually mean IgG swimming around in the blood. However, IgA is also very much a “neutralizing antibody” though remember it is found mostly in the “sticky” places of our body. This will be important later.

# VACCINE BASICS

Most vaccines work by essentially pulling a fakie on our immune system by using pieces of bugs (or even just dead bugs) so that we begin making our little soldier immunoglobulins/antibodies before the bug actually arrives. Unfortunately, vaccines never trigger a truly full immune response. Most (but not all) vaccines primarily produce serum IgG (“neutralizing antibody”). Remember from above that IgM transitions to IgG and that this usually takes at least few weeks? This is why most vaccines require at least one booster shot. You know our stomach is used to digest food? This is why most vaccines are given to us with a needle (because our stomach would destroy the vaccine).

Vaccines can be thought of as existing in two groups: (1) Vaccines that stop you from dying, and (2) Vaccines that stop you from giving your bug to others. While both of these categories are immensely useful, **only this second category can result in herd immunity**. More on that in a moment. While it would be ideal for all vaccines to fall perfectly into both categories at the same time, the vaccines that manage to achieve that are usually live vaccines (which we try to avoid using). Polio is a great example as there were both live and killed polio vaccines. The killed polio vaccine prevented disease and death, but it did not prevent people from carrying and giving polio to the rest of the world. On the other hand, the live polio vaccine prevented disease and death as well as prevented people from carrying and giving polio to the rest of the world. (Live vaccines are otherwise beyond this discussion.)

# HERD IMMUNITY

Herd immunity is when a population as a whole becomes effectively immune to a bug simply because that bug lost its ability to travel between people. (A spider cannot bite you if it cannot get to you!) There are two primary ways to achieve herd immunity: (1) Mass natural infection, and (2) Mass vaccination. Mass natural infection is by far the most effective option (because it triggers a full immune response), but it is also by far the most lethal. Voluntarily attempting to achieve herd immunity through mass natural infection would incredibly devastating and a clearly unethical option for a bug like COVID-19.

Remember from above that vaccines never trigger a truly full immune response? This is partly why the flu vaccine only gives us a partial herd immunity. (Influenza also mutates a lot.) This is also why the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will almost certainly never come close to providing us with herd immunity. These vaccines are missing the key to herd immunity.

What piece of the immune system makes herd immunity possible? It does not matter if herd immunity is achieved through mass infection or through mass vaccination, the primary and required key is—by far—IgA. Remember from above that IgA primarily lives in the “sticky” parts of our bodies, but also remember from above that most vaccines primarily produce IgG? We need IgA in the “sticky” places because that’s where most bugs enter our bodies. We need IgG once those bugs have found their way inside of us.

# ANALOGY

As an analogy, imagine an arsonist catching a house on fire. The IgG would be the firefighters and police coming to put out the fire and arrest the arsonist. IgG is doing great work! But this doesn’t fix the damage that’s been done, it does not guarantee that the burglar won’t burn down another home once released from jail, and it does not protect your home from being burned down again a year from now. On the other hand, IgA would be the gated fence surrounding the home, motion sensor security lights, security cameras, and alarm system that ultimately results in the arsonist moving along from your home to target a much easier home with fewer front-line defenses. In this analogy, vaccines like Moderna and Pfizer are the police and firefighters (because they produce mostly IgG) whereas vaccines like Vaxart and Altimmune are the fences, lights, and alarms (because they produce mostly IgA). While no home is ever truly safe from being burned down, having the most security features exponentially decreases the odds of houses being burned down. Indeed, it is exceedingly difficult to find a house that has been burned down by an arsonist in a community that has equipped all of these security features on every home.

# CONCLUSION

**Pfizer, Moderna, and even Novavax will likely continue protect us from dying of COVID, but we will still harbor and transmit COVID** within our mucosa (while likely being mostly asymptomatic). Most concerningly, this will be how we will inevitably breed innumerable new variants of COVID throughout the world. Hopefully these will be no more severe than the current dominant strain, but we must keep in mind that SARS and MERS (though less transmissible) are both coronaviruses and that all it would take is for just the right mutation(s) to take place for COVID-19 to become far deadlier. **While the current authorized vaccines are wonderful and are absolutely necessary in fighting the pandemic, they have—and will always have—devastating shortcomings for which we will ultimately pay if we do not bridge this gap in susceptibility quickly. Vaxart and Altimmune seem to be the two most promising candidates to help us bridge this gap through their mucosal IgA protection.** There is so much ground to cover with a lot more room for additional vaccines to round out our defenses. **At minimum, we must achieve both an IgG response (to prevent disease and death)** ***and*** **an IgA response (to prevent transmission). Without the prevention of transmission, it is not “if” but “when” we ultimately breed a devastatingly fatal breed of coronavirus.** We have wonderful IgG vaccines. Let us support and work hard to ensure we get some IgA vaccines as soon as possible so that we can all be safe and return to normal life.

The only analyst that seems to have unwavering optimism for Vaxart is Mayank Mamtani (top 100 on TipRanks) with a price target of $16 (+100% upside), but even his reasoning is, while not incorrect, totally different from my own reasoning and ultimately fails to see a bigger picture.

67,Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - Reality Check,132,0.89,SirBuzzKill777,"Some other loser was on here trying to pump the common (FNMA and FMCC). I just wanted to drop this in as a reality check for people before they go charging in like idiots and in all likelihood are met with disappointment. I commented this on the first post but thought it may have better reach as it's own standalone post.


The other post : https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkn9vj/fnma_and_fmcc_going_to_explode_soon_compare_them/



I've been following this trade for about 4 years now. I bought in at a bad time and I'm underwater but I still believe in the underlying investment thesis and thus have not sold all the times I've been above water too.

I am going to quickly break it down for people:

INVESTMENT THESIS:

FNMA and FMCC (the companies) basically got taken over by the government, they are massively profitable but all of their money goes to Uncle Fucking Sam, like in perpetuity. This is because in 2012 Uncle Sam saw they were going to be profitable and possibly pay back the original loan they made during the '08 crisis, and they didn't like that, so they just... changed the agreement. :) 

Seriously, go read the emails that were sent at this time by government officials, read about the meetings they had and the information they were provided. For me, this was clearly robbery and then they lied about it. That being said, the court cases that have been chasing this agreement for years now lost a lot, largely because of the complexity of HERA (the statute that governs the FHFA, the conservator of FNMA and FMCC) and the courts never really looking at the evidence but rather whether or not they even were allowed to. However, plaintiffs had a massive victory in the 5th Circuit Court of appeals, which was then appealed to SCOTUS. You can go listen to the SCOTUS oral argument and we are now waiting their ruling.

INVESTMENT VEHICLES:

The other post was pumping the common, this is likely a massive mistake. The jr pfds are likely much better and still have a potential 5x upside at today's prices (a month or so ago I put in another 12k). There are MANY MANY things that need to go right for the common to payout, and the commons basically have zero legal representation at the moment. Pfds have much fewer things that need to go right to get paid and have almost all the heavy hitters behind them. Ackman is the only guy holding commons I believe.

WHAT MAY HAPPEN:

Right now we are all-in on a SCOTUS ruling in our favor. 5th circuit went our way but all those gains have been sold off. If we win SCOTUS, guess what, if the government doesn't settle we could still be waiting 2-3 years for the APA claims to be judged on evidence. We have a STRONG case on that though and the government likely doesn't want egg on its face. If SCOTUS goes against us good fucking luck, we have one more case that is slated for 1.5 years from now or so and besides that we're at the mercy of the new admin and congress (e.g. we lose 50% or so from here at least).

WHERE WE HAVE BEEN:

The previous admin promised to make changes and get us out of conservatorship and basically failed to deliver entirely. The companies cap standards are pretty miserable now and Mnuchin basically kicked the can down the road (pray to Yellen if you buy in cause you're her bitch now). Court cases have been like all court cases and infinitely slow but the gears do turn.

HOW TO DO SOME DD:

Go follow holdenwalker99 and urbankaoboy on Twitter. Do not follow Glenn (used to post as /u/TheSerpent
 on here). That guy is a fucking moron who has some major fucking ego problems. You will come across his name often on this trade as he is a good flag bearer, but don't pay any attention to his thinking, like I said, fucking moron. The two dudes I mentioned are probably the most rational and knowledgeable (respectively) people I have come across in the years I have been following it. Glenn is more like the mascot at a sports game while the other two are the players.

Anyways, if you buy in, be prepared for the long haul. This trade is something that forever seems to be just a few weeks around the corner to a Nirvana that never comes. Many people have aptly called it the ""Waiting for Godot"" trade for that reason.

Anyways, good luck!

TL/DR - If you choose to go in  buy jr pfds, avoid the ones that have zero % interest rates right now, and good fucking luck to us all.

69,One picture should help you decide which weed company to invest in (Hint: It's not $SNDL),170,0.75,Unlockabear,"I know this sub hates 🌈🐻, but every once in a while a healthy dose of cynicism can help this growing community. Lately there has been a lot of activity surrounding $SNDL and how it's going to be THE weed company if/when the US legalizes. 

[Top 50 weed companies: Left US, Right Canada, latest quarterly earnings and change from prior quarter. Twitter: cannabisnewsDD](https://preview.redd.it/o0xzutazgrh61.png?width=2208&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ffccfd9cb88f0f19402efa77a7dbadf2d2cbdc7)

I know you autists hate numbers, so I've provided a picture for you. Notice where SNDL is? Nowhere near the fucking top. In fact, if you combined this list into one, they would be 42nd. If the US legalizes weed, there are already a huge amount of companies already primed and ready to go for the US market. Even if they were a US player, they wouldn't be one of the major players.

Now lets address some popular points:

**SHORT SQUEEZE JUST LIKE $GME TO THE MOON!**

Now there has been a lot of talk about how there's going to be a ""short squeeze"" on SNDL and one google search to find they have 1.5 BILLION shares outstanding should be enough for even the average autists to realize this isn't likely. In fact the company recently filed to sell even more shares to raise cash. 

[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-growers-announces-closing-of-its-us74-5-million-registered-offering-301222544.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sundial-growers-announces-closing-of-its-us74-5-million-registered-offering-301222544.html)

**But they have cash, don't they?**

No shit, they have cash, they're issues shares like it's the toilet paper shortage. It doesn't matter, they aren't profitable and not a big player. You know who is profitable? Many of the **US companies** on the left

**I heard their weed is really great! Someone commented on that?**

Really? Who isn't going to say their weed is amazing? If anything, their weed is so bad, investors have sued them for not disclosing how bad it is:

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sundial-sued-in-us-for-failing-to-disclose-half-ton-of-cannabis-was-returned-to-client-2019-10-07](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sundial-sued-in-us-for-failing-to-disclose-half-ton-of-cannabis-was-returned-to-client-2019-10-07)

Honestly the fact that there is a widely circulated meme picture that people are going to hold this stock until $420 should be enough to deter you from the stock. 

If you're looking for a weed company to ride the potential US legalization, pick a company on the left. $SNDL is **NOT** it. Do not fall for all the bag holders and bots waiting for you to rescue them.

70,AMD strong upside for this week.,357,0.89,BeardlessPete,"I honestly should have posted this last week because the trade is already in progress, but there is probably still time:

**The DD:**

AMD has strong upside for this week. There are two basic reasons for my view on this.

1. Fundamental points:
   1. Strong earnings reports over the past 3 quarters.
   2. Despite strong earnings, no real price spike. Been hovering between 80-90.
2. Technical points:
   1. The stock cross the 9-day moving average on 2/8/2021
   2. The stock formed a golden cross on 2/8/2021. This is very important because this stock has tried to form a golden cross 2 times previously and failed to do so within the past few weeks. However, this time it has formed the cross and it's continuing to go.
   3. RSI is continuing to trend up, indicating there is still gas for positive price action.
   4. Crossed 50 day moving average on 2/10/2021

&#x200B;

[Top is price action on 9-day. Middle is MACD. Bottom is RSI. If you don't know what these terms mean then please look them up.](https://preview.redd.it/7hj2tc6jbrh61.jpg?width=659&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7859d033c6af8f430eddefcfd30d7960da6a2bf1)

Basically, on the fundamentals this stock is ""due"" for a push up. On the technical side, we can see that it's starting to go up.

Overall, the 9th would have really been a good time to enter the trade because most of the elevating factors had already formed. And now with the futures up it's likely going to open up a lot higher, but still I see room to go up.

**The exit strategy:**

If you do decide to enter this trade, and it does become profitable for you, here is how you can look to get out.

1. On the MACD, when the **green bar goes from a dark green to a light green just sell the stock.** The simple view is this: dark green means strong bullish, light green means it's reversing to bearish. Dark red means bearish. Light red means reversing to bullish. Obviously this is overly simplified and subject to exceptions - but it's the general rule and if you know it you're better off than if you don't know anything at all.
2. If you want to stay in longer (because obviously none of this is guaranteed) you can wait until the price moves close to the 9-day moving average. Once it moves under that then I'd take all my money off the table. 

I use technicals as a piece of trading stocks, but I tend to never base an entire decision on trading stocks. Charts are useful because they give me more information and help me make decisions based on what is actually happening in the market. Essentially, they prevent me from making emotional decisions and allow me to think in a cool and collected way when I trade.

Do with this what you will. I have no idea if AMD will continue to rally. But, if I was looking to add a stock to a rolling basket of swing trade positions I would consider AMD.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkujx7/amd_strong_upside_for_this_week/,1613474451.0
71,DraftKings DD - Earnings report 2/26,56,0.73,GladiatorBear,"As of 2/2, momma Cathy's got about 620,000 shares of Draftkings on board the ARKW.

In the last week and a half since then, we've seen DraftKings hit its 52 week high on 2/5 of $63.57, and a nice little expected pullback that was further dragged down due to the outages seen on SuperBowl Sunday, outages that affected not just DKNG but hurt Penn, Fanduel, etc.

In addition to this dip, we saw Cathy bring on another 800,000 shares to the ARK in this time which was published on the Ark Invest site, seen in the holdings report put out on 2/12 report.

This makes sense for anyone opening up a long position in a company they see as a disruptive force for the future, but what caught my eye here was the fact that the **next earnings report is on 2/26, a little shy of 3 weeks away from these moves.**

Looking back, DKNG has missed the mark and their projected earnings in recent quarters due to their insistence on advertising spending and more notably the lack of active sports to bet on in Q2 and Q3 of last year, but Q4 2020 sees the start up of the NFL, the NHL, and the last parts of the NBA Playoffs. This points to a potential to potentially beat projections and start getting things moving in the right direction. Regardless, they're the largest company in online sports betting and currently lead other online companies in this sector with 16% of the market locked down since October.

With legalization of sports gambling in our future with the new administration, a lot of heads have been turning to this market and there's a sizable chunk of revenue incentivizing the legalization in the states that haven't done so already.

I've been a long time lurker and haven't commented a whole lot but I figured I'd share my thoughts on this, one retard to another. Feel free to put me up on the cross for anything I might have stated incorrectly or messed up.

&#x200B;

TL/DR

ARKW more than doubled their position in DKNG the past 2 weeks and we're coming up on an earnings report that has some potential to be a sign of things turning around for sports betting in a covid world

At current price level $126/share (P/E of 12ish), $DGX is the closest thing you can find to guaranteed tendies. Will it be a 10 bagger? While possible, probably not. However, **it is a virtual lock for a double up+ play trading calls.**

It isn't often you come across a stock with minimal potential headwinds (i.e. ""risk"", ya autists) , a strong reputation, over a billion of $ on hand, and coming off of consecutive Qs of record revenue growth and margin expansion **THAT IS TRADING AT ROUGHLY HALF THE P/E of many competitors.**

**Also, some** **52 week price performance:**

1. QDEL - 185%
2. LH - 27.1%
3. DGX - 13.4%

*Ok, I don't know what P/E ratio is jackass. I joined WSB 3 weeks ago. What else ya got?* Oh, plenty. Just starting with the very basic stuff. I'll even avoid deeper analytics since I know you all would just breeze past em anyway.

**Recent Earnings Call & Guidance (2/4/21):**

Historically, Q4 is a down Q for DGX because people aren't running to the doctors and undergoing procedures during the holiday season. Granted I schedule all of my appointments during this time to avoid the in-laws, but apparently I'm in the minority. Anyway, **DGX actually beat lofty expectations in Q4 and drastically raised guidance for the first 6 months of 2021.** Key items:

* Beat estimated Revenue by 2.73%, EPS 5.7%
* Quarter Revenue growth (yoy) over 55%, Earnings over 120%
* Announced additional ONE BILLION, with a $B, authorization in share repurchases. This is in addition to $900m+ previously approved. **Quest is approved for nearly TWO BILLION in $ share repurchases for 2021**. More importantly, the c-suite flat out stated they planned on being aggressive in repurchasing during the year after pulling back in 2020 during the call.

1. In 2020, DGX only repurchased $325m: [https://ycharts.com/companies/DGX/stock\_buyback](https://ycharts.com/companies/DGX/stock_buyback)
2. As previously mentioned, they are sitting on a boatload of cash...especially after more government AR converts
3. Their CEO is a dinosaur. He will be using almost all of this TWO BILLION authorization

* Increased dividend by 10%
* Great continued improvements in serology area
* **NOTE:** This company is notoriously CONSERVATIVE in their projections. Sandbagging pricks.

**THE ONE & ONLY CONCERN -** The reason this stock constantly runs up into earnings and then ticks lower despite large beats is solely due to their base testing lagging behind typical performance due to COVID. The market is acting as if the COVID faucet will just get shut off in the snap of a finger (soon) and then the base testing will take time to return. Does this sound right to you? **This line of thinking is laughably absurd and naïve.** Reasons:

* After a year of this shit, there is a massive backlog of people/procedures that will be completed after more of the pop is vaccinated. We haven't even seen a DGX Q performance with strong base testing AND COVID $$$ yet. Q1 of 2021 will be the first. Book it.
* **COVID Testing - Rampant testing isn't going anywhere anytime soon**. As of Jan 26th, all international flights require a COVID test to return (obviously DGX, LH, etc. are facilitating much of this work). Then rumors swirled this week that negative tests could potentially become required to fly even domestically. Millions of students remain out of school...reminder the current vaccines are mostly for age 16+. So expect strict testing for students too during 2021, mandated by the crybaby teacher unions. Sport leagues as well as I'm sure not everyone will get the vaccine.
* **Political climate / stimulus** \- I'm sure you all saw the CDC is now ""recommending"" double masking. Hell, I've passed out four times writing this diatribe due to the 6 masks I'm wearing. Why does this matter? For every bit a person feels the previous admin downplayed COVID, the new admin is going 100% the opposite direction. Considering the US is going to continue to pump trillions into the economy, you can bet your ass all testing companies will benefit. There will definitely be huge grants/subsidies for enhanced serology procedures and research....and of course in analyzing COVID further. These testing companies have so much COVID data that will continue to be poured over as the pandemic lessens. You can also bet there will be an increased $ focus on scanning/checking for new viruses in the near future.
* **$$$$$$$** \- Do you think DGX is just going to light the enormous $$$ they've made over the past 9 months and will continue to make for 2021 on fire? Because that's what the current stock price/growth reflects. When in reality and in addition to the buybacks, they will be targeting acquisitions in 2nd half 2021 and investing heavily in serology capabilities/analysis.

**VERY quick chart breakdown** \- most of you prob don't chart a ton, but doesn't take DFV to see the long sustained consolidation. This is begging to jump upwards and it will by next earnings. Even better, outside of an overall market pullback, there aren't any potential catalysts for a downward swing.

**Worthless analyst commentary** \- Most recently, Citi upgraded PT to $158 on 1/29.

**POSITIONS** \- Again, I see VERY little risk in this move. Worst Case PT: $120, Best Case: $170

* Sold position (2/19 $130 calls) pre-earnings during run up for 400%+ return in roughly 3 weeks
* Holding: $10k in shares

73,The Commodity Super-cycle trade: A macro DD with special focus on industrial metals,537,0.94,Golddigger2500,"“Commodities? What the hell is that?” asks the GME Ape, used to blockbusters stocks and phone companies from the 90s. We are talking oil, natural gas, industrial and precious metals, corn, GOURDS, etc. Got it? You don’t want to mess with commodity futures? No problem, there are more than enough stocks and ETFs proxies through which you can place your bets. But before tackling tickers, let’s talk fundamentals and let me lay out the bullish case for commodities, specifically industrial metals (steel😲, copper, aluminum, rare earth metals).

# Commodity Super-cycle?

Commodities go through cycles of booms and bust, following economic cycles of activity, and inflation. Growth and inflation make commodities go uppies, and recessions or periods of slower economic growth, coupled with deflationary pressures, make commodities go tits up. Specifically, commodities tend to rise rapidly when the economy goes into “overdrive” mode, so towards the second half of economic expansions. This is because as the economy accelerates, the supply for raw materials can’t keep up with the demand, leading to price escalations up to a point where demand has to correct abruptly, causing a recession. Then, commodity prices free fall as the economy goes through deflation, and investment typically shifts towards innovation and disruptive tech, preparing for the new cycle. Then, the economy eventually recovers and starts to slowly pick up speed, and the new cycle is in. You can see that post-2000 (coinciding more or less with the pop of the .com bubble), was the start of a rally in commodities (**Chart 1).**

**Chart 1: US commodity price index 1795 to present** (as of August 2020)

https://preview.redd.it/gmz5xuox7ph61.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a262060bed4870cf4bc0834a46f71d5ccd5fa21

Why was that? We were coming out of a pretty long period of economic deflationary stability and then accelerated going into the 2000s. As inflation started to pick up, investment flew out of tech and into commodities, given the demand for them was massive. There was massive GDP growth coming from the BRICS, the .com tech creating more jobs and more income/household, and massive lending growth backed by the US housing market (the economy was leveraged to the tits); all this strong, *tangible* (this is crucial, more on that later) economic activity generated a lot of demand for raw materials as houses and factories were built, cars were manufactured, cities rose all around the world (particularly in Asia), and so commodity prices went uppies. Of course, the economy was overleveraged, and like most FDs you hold for too long, it went tits up real quick at the expiration date. The recession post-GFC sent commodities down, and when there was economic recovery, commodities stayed pretty low. Why was that? Deflationary pressures coming from a risk-averse banking system and an increasingly efficient, high tech-driven economy could be a place to start. But from a cycle perspective, this was still the first half of the economic expansion following the recession, and there was still too much deflation for commodities to pick up real momentum. Of course, when March 2020 hit and everything went tits up, what little momentum commodities had was instantly lost as the entire world economy went through a massive deflationary bust. Suddenly, nothing moved, and nothing was built, and so there was barely any demand for commodities. But now that we begin to recover from the pandemic, are things any different than they were prior to it? If before the dreadful 2020 commodities were cheap, why would they begin to rally in 2021?

I’ll begin by analyzing what is going on right now with commodities from a technical perspective, and then I’ll give you what I think is the *why* behind it? Sounds good? Let’s dive into it then.

# What’s the technical outlook?

Being guilty of serious crayon-eating to the point of literally shitting colors every weekend, I never build a thesis without some technical ANALysis, so let’s look at a few charts to see where we are in the cycle technically, and then I’ll make the fundamental argument for the industrial metals reversal. **Chart 1** showed that we are at exceptionally low price levels, and it also shows that commodities don’t tend to stay at those prices very long. However, is a reversal going on right now? For this, no need to go back to Napoleonic Wars, let’s just look at the last decade or so. There is in fact a technical reversal in commodities going on, and it would be confirmed if we get above 90-100 on the BCOM (**Chart 2**). The *Coom*berg Commodity Index tracks commodity prices.

**Chart 2:** ***Coom*****berg Commodity Index (BCOM)**

https://preview.redd.it/kjfw2vma8ph61.jpg?width=1826&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ad8c833da4702d11cbb358c90ed909ac5c8c63d

Let’s have a look now at some specifics, namely industrial metals. Commodities tend to move in unison, so it is expected from steel (and, in the case of an index, companies working along the steel supply chain) to have a similar price action to the BCOM. Indeed, you can see on **Chart 3** that it’s the same breakout of the multi-year trend.

**Chart 3:** **ARCA Steel Index (STTL)**

https://preview.redd.it/ub7trgae8ph61.jpg?width=1833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0ff90918a5ba4ee9235b843a8f814bf96fee621

What about copper? Yeah, the same thing, but more extended than its industrial metal peers (**Chart 4**), due to the fact there has been quite a few strikes going on causing a supply shock, but I also believe people understood the vital role of copper in the EV industry and in de-carbonization (more on that later) a few months before they realized most industrial metals were going to go along the same path.

**Chart 4:** **US Copper Index Fund (CPER)**

https://preview.redd.it/2bwl1t5i8ph61.jpg?width=1820&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=899bc4e45465edda59e86dd73a987a4a364a93d9

As you would expect, other industrial metals, such as aluminum, follow similar patterns. While WSB was screeching GME (except Steel Bros, you guys nailed it), industrial metals were rallying, and are now at their inflection point, or past it (in the case of copper for example). So why is any of this happening? While we’re still on a crayon-eating binge, let’s have a look at the 5-yr forward inflation expectations chart (**Chart 5**). Ok, so consumers and businesses are expecting prices to increase at a higher rate 5 years from now, and believe inflation will be over 2% in 2025. Do you see a similarity with the BCOM? That’s because commodities and inflation go hand in hand, as I explained previously. While inflation is not sitting over 2% right now, it is expected to be in the future and commodity traders and hedge funds are already placing their bets, so the market is adjusting ahead of time, as it should.

**Chart 5:** **5-yr Forward Inflation Expectation Rate**

https://preview.redd.it/pp39er5m8ph61.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=543768ae6d5f09e89eb809ba7c4985707db69ab1

But isn’t inflation good for all equities? If we were to rely solely on inflation expectations, why would commodities be a better move than say, tech? My belief is that the huge rally that has been going on with Big Tech for years was fueled by deflation, not inflation. Our economy has only become more and more efficient given all of the technological innovation that has been going on (think of automation), leaving people out of work with less income and driving prices down. This is good for tech, but it is rather deflationary, so when I hear inflation expectations are up significantly, it makes me rather neutral to bearish on tech, and much more bullish on commodities. For now, let’s have a look at **Chart 6**, a ratio between the S&P500 and the PPI (the log of that actually). The way to interpret this is the following: when the ratio is going up, stocks, in general, are beating commodities, and when it is going down, commodities are beating stocks. Obviously, this excludes stocks which revenues rely on commodities since those stocks would typically be up when commodities are up (ex: metal processing stocks, mining stocks, etc.). Periods of inflation are better for commodities than for stocks, and vice-versa for deflationary phases. It doesn’t necessarily mean stocks will go down when inflation runs higher, but commodities will tend to outperform the market. One extreme case of this was the .com bubble pop, which immediately made commodities more attractive than stocks, and coincided with the start of an inflationary period that lasted until around the GFC.

**Chart 6:** **S&P 500/PPI (log)**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/me3zn6sq8ph61.jpg?width=1372&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f73bf6327287e80202491966eb1d8da994337d40

So by looking at this chart, seeing that we have been in a prolonged period of relative deflation, recognizing that equities are pretty overextended as of right now compared to commodities, and noting that inflation expectations are up (meaning a new wave of inflation might be forming ahead), I would argue that solely based on this there exists an arbitrage opportunity: short tech, long commodities. But shorting tech is rather wild, and if you are a conflicted bull that knows the tech rally must be approaching its end but you won’t go full u/Variation-Separate, you might as well just long commodities while reducing your tech exposure, or at least add some of that sweet sweet *coom*modity to your folio as a hedge.

This concludes our technical analysis for now. Congrats if you’ve made it this far and managed to keep your rectum intact, you’ve survived. Now, why is this taking place now? In other words, why are inflation expectations up now, as opposed to a year or two from now? Why is the BCOM breaking out of its multi-year downtrend right now, while we’re still mostly on lockdown when it’s been falling for years under a “normal” economy? Calling a bottom is as hard as calling a top, but while sometimes bubbles pop out of sheer exhaustion, it is rarer for prices to rebound after years of downtrend without any catalyst. So what’s the catalyst then? Is it just Grandpa Buyden and his big, long, and beautiful stimulus, or is there something else?

# What’s the fundamental outlook?

Now comes the juicy part. This is the sauce, this is what you came looking for and this is what will hopefully give you the confirmation bias you need and deserve. The question we must ask ourselves is the following: are the conditions for a commodity rally, more precisely in industrial metals, met or be met in the near future?

In other words, is there right now or will there be in the near future a supply and demand imbalance in industrial metals? If we look at the charts, it appears there is one, given the rally we’ve had in the past weeks, but this could just be speculation, right? Or maybe there was one, but now it’s all priced in? I’ll try to give you reasons for the current imbalance, as well as reasons for further imbalances in the future that will likely end up causing a multi-year rally similar to ones before (think 1970s, 2000s). The reasons are the following: Buyden’s Stimulus Plan, “Going Green”, China’s Infrastructure Spending, China’s Accumulation of Metals, India increasing CapEx spending, Wealth Redistribution Policies and Years of Low CapEx in the Commodity Complex. I’ll split these into 2 groups, the demand side, and the supply side.

# Demand

**-Buyden’s Stimulus Plan and “Going Green”**

Now, I know bears will say this is blasphemy. They will say fiscal policy won’t spur inflation; no matter how much spending, the government has never had any success creating inflation and it won’t this time either. I hear you and I agree, untargeted and irresponsible spending has never had any success in generating any kind of sustainable inflation. But are we going to ignore the fact that this is 1.9 trillion + another 2 trillion for infrastructure? Are we going to ignore the fact that Yellen believes this can achieve FULL EMPLOYMENT by 2022? Full employment people, in one year. This would be an economy on fucking steroids, and the price of going into full employment in such a short period of time is inflation. I just can’t see supply being able to adjust to such an increase in household income in such a short period of time, that is if full employment is really to be achieved. Now, full employment could be a pipe dream, it could be yet again another game Yellen is playing to get inflation expectations moving and banks lending, but the sheer possibility of it is enough for the economy to move in that direction. Full employment would be the “overdrive” mode I talked about previously, and that would set the stage for a big rally in commodities. Let me also add that some republicans who opposed Buyden’s plan did so on grounds that it would cause runaway inflation and that such a risk outweighed all of its benefits. It’s all politics, so it doesn’t mean anything on its own, but it can give some idea of the magnitude of how much spending is going on.

Regarding industrial metals like steel, copper, aluminum, and even silver, Buyden’s infrastructure spending is of course bullish. 52% of all steel produced ends up being used for infrastructure projects, so the infrastructure plan aiming at “re-building” a “greener” US is very bullish for steel. New infrastructure, new housing, new buildings and facilities of all kinds is obviously very good for industrial metals. The fact it is meant to be a “green” plan is particularly bullish for copper (think of batteries, wiring, etc.), which has already strongly reacted to this. This in itself is good, but I think it has the potential to have much more growth because it might initiate a bigger modernization wave across all industries, as they strive to “go green”. Just like the US, I can see governments around the world taking the same path; not only because it is good politically as more and more people care about the planet, but because it is a matter of remaining competitive in the future world economy. The automobile industry is going through this change, and ALREADY there is a supply problem. Everybody speaks about the semiconductor shortage, but I think this is just a symptom of a much larger supply issue that is looming ahead. Think about all the factories semiconductor producers will have to build from the ground up to meet demand in the coming years. Some won’t be ready before 2025. What about the famous Elon’s battery gigafactories? Approximately 100 of them will be necessary to supply the entire world with clean energy according to his autist brain (love you Papa), and I assume it is only to meet the current world’s energy demand (wait until India, and eventually Latin America, finalize their industrialization). How many other ambitious projects similar to these will come in the future given all the investment that has been pouring into tech for nearly a decade? What I’m getting at here is that “going green” will cause a “structural change in demand” (quoting Goldman; I typically inverse them, but not this time lol) for industrial metals as there will be A LOT of changes in manufacturing infrastructure, and a good part of it will have to be built from scratch.

This isn’t related to going green, but what about all the innovation going on with 3D printing? Eventually, there will be large 3D printers that will print-out houses and buildings, but they will necessitate gigantic factories to build them so they can build other buildings. You find that funny don’t you? It’s going to fucking happen dude, someday. No, but seriously, all of the crazy innovation that has been going on during the last deflationary years, all of the ARK shit, all of that will eventually have to be built using unconventional and new manufacturing, meaning, you guessed it, more manufacturing infrastructure will have to be built from scratch, causing inflation in industrial metals since the demand will largely outpace the supply like it happens every fucking time. And that’s the super-cycle. It’s the supply of material resources of one economic phase not being able to keep up with the innovation-driven demand from the previous phase, causing prices to escalate during the growth phase. It happened in the 1970s, it happened in the 2000s, and it’ll happen again, sooner rather than later imo.

\-**Gyna: Doubling down on infrastructure spending and accumulating industrial metals**

Say what you will about the china men, but they know what’s up. They understood before anyone that transitioning into a sustainable, greener economy was not nearly as much a moral duty as it was the premise for economic competitiveness. Only now is the US beginning to catch up to what China has been doing for years: invest in infrastructure to enable the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy. When the rest of the world was caught up in the GFC mess, instead of having to prop up its financial system, China invested even more in infrastructure and construction jobs. Regarding metals’ accumulation, it is perfectly understandable. They must think they will need them in the future and that they will be much more valuable a few years from now, otherwise they wouldn’t be accumulating and producing them like crazy. In the case of crude steel production, China’s production accounted for 53.3% of the world’s production in 2019 versus 46.6% in 2009. They have been ramping up production (probably in anticipation of a surge in demand), and I don’t want to bet against them because, so far, they seem to know what they’re doing.

**-India to increase CapEx spending**

Did you forget about India, the second-largest country by population size? New roads, new power grids, new rails, new pipelines, new housing, and new healthcare infrastructure are part of the Indian government’s plan to augment the country’s infrastructure as part of the Union Budget for 2021-22. Most of the country is still rural, and therefore lacks infrastructure, a problem the government is attempting to fix by increasing capital expenditure spending. Do you see what is going on? World leaders are killing 2 birds with one stone here. They are using infrastructure spending as a springboard to achieve post-pandemic economic recovery, thereby not only putting their economies back on their feet, but also addressing an issue that had to be dealt with anyway: a lack of new, modern, and greener infrastructure. This is wildly bullish on industrial metals if you ask me because other countries are likely to follow the same path.

**-Wealth Redistribution Policies**

Give a wealthy man a mil and he’ll invest it boomer dividend stocks like the rest of his 10 million dollars, since he already has a dream house, a dream car, and, unluckily for him, he can’t buy a dream wife on the open market, so in the meantime, he’ll strive to get richer. Give a wagie a mil and he’ll spend it faster than it takes a WSB degen to YOLO his paycheck on some 0dte FDs. The marginal propensity to consume of lower-income households is much higher than that of higher-income households, so because wealth redistribution effectively shifts income from investment to consumption, it is typically inflationary. Wealth redistribution has been part of the Democrats’ agenda for a long time and is also a component of the Covid Relief bill. Furthermore, with the likes of AOC gaining more and more traction among younger generations (AOC simps in particular), I can see these types of policies gain much more momentum in the future, given the current wealth gap is pretty abysmal and has the potential to cause social unrest if it is undealt with. And what about rising wages? I don’t think the $15 national minimum wage is going to materialize itself anytime soon, but there is nevertheless a push for wage raises undergoing (again, courtesy of the dems). This is, again, mainly beneficial to lower-income families and leads to a much more commodity-intensive economy, as a larger part of the population is able to afford housing, home appliances, automobiles, etc. than previously. This is obviously inflationary as well.

# Supply

\-**Low Capital Expenditure in the “Commodity Complex”**

This is a key component of the super-cycle thesis. What causes the rally in industrial metals is not only the sudden increase in demand but also the fact supply is unprepared. We know the industry that has been suffering from underinvestment for years and will unlikely be able to adjust to demand quickly enough. Since commodity prices started falling after the GFC, there’s been a dramatic decrease in capital expenditure for metal processing companies, miners, and industrials, as you would expect during a recession (add to that the manufacturing crisis). Furthermore, CapEx growth never came back to 2008 highs and has just been further dipping during the last decade, and even went negative following the pandemic adverse demand shock (in the case of steel for example). Producers had to outright cut back on investment just to keep their operating activities afloat. Although global capacity in industrial metals is still big enough to meet the demand today, given the state of the industry after the pandemic blow, I don’t think there will be overcapacity again like there was prior to 2019/2020, since the industry was momentarily weakened in the past months. This is precisely when prices tend to bottom, and then only does investment starts returning back into the industry, anticipating higher prices, and eventually margins improve when prices and the industry do recover, but with fewer players in it (**Chart 7** shows this cycle). I believe we are currently at the “Prices bottom” phase, and already we are seeing mining and metal processing stocks up. Investors are already expecting higher metal prices and profit margins, and investment is starting to flow back into the industry.

**Chart 7:** **Metals’ investment cycle**

# Bottom Line

""Listen, here's the deal"", we are about to have a manufacturing boom. There, I said it. Come at me bears! (except tech bears though). The US, China, and India are betting on huge infrastructure projects, and we're talking huge bets. Trillions. I believe the private sector is not gonna stand idle; they will follow and will also make massive manufacturing investments to turn around their businesses so they can be competitive in this new, high-tech, environmentally sustainable economy. This is big. As the demand for these types of massive investments goes up, interest rates will start increasing (this is not happening overnight, we're talking in a while), and then banks will be more than happy to lend at the right price (right now they just won't do it, they're not getting their risk's worth). Lending growth ✔️. As manufacturing starts rolling again, there will be more jobs and GDP growth ✔️. Full employment could very well happen, but realistically it will take more than a year; might still happen though. ""Overdrive mode""✔️. More employment means more income and with redistribution policies in place, more of that income will be spent back into the economy, driving prices up. Inflation✔️ Meanwhile, you have a metals' industry that is lagging the economy, as it did not receive the kinds of capital flows tech has enjoyed for a decade. Lack of raw materials supply ✔️. This generates a continued, multi-year, upward pressure on industrial metals prices. That's the super-cycle trade, investing where there is underinvestment in anticipation of the demand that's coming ahead. And look at it as an asymmetric bet, since you don't stand that much to lose with commodity prices this low. How much lower can they really get? And you know they'll rebound eventually, so you can double down if they dip again, and that's what makes the trade so interesting. Ask yourself, when the tech bubble pops, where is that money going to go? We've gone over this.

&#x200B;

# Hmm that's cool and all... but where are my tickers??

Ok, this is a Macro DD, it's in the title. I have not had the chance to take a deep dive into specific companies in order to find the hidden gems that will benefit the most from this (pls, if someone has done it, comment it in the thread that would be awesome). But if you want some tickers, I'll give you some. They can be broken down into categories. There's the steel sector (Steel Gang I got you fam), there's the Copper sector, and there's Silver (hey, there's industrial applications, and apparently there's already a fkg shortage so yeah, I'm adding it). I won't go into the specifics of the company, I'll just give you a quick overview of financials + valuation, so you'll have to put up *some* work yourself.

PS-I know there are other industrial metals such as Palladium, Platinum, Nickel, etc., but this DD is getting long af so I'll limit myself to just a few, but the super-cycle thesis is bullish on all industrial metals, so feel free to shoot other industrial metals tickers you are bullish on.

# Steel Sector

As I said before, 52% of all steel demand comes from infrastructure projects, so the fact governments around the world are investing like crazy in infrastructure is a think a good start for a steel rally. Steel gang knows all about it, and there's been DD on it, so go check it out, macro-wise, they're probably right.

**X**

https://preview.redd.it/np1cfyy3lph61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2271eee78f8fe217f4db722ab709ec741b795193

Basically for the degens. Small-cap with low float, much weaker balance sheet than its peers, but with more room for growth. Trading currently 20% below ""fair value"" should you use a DCF model. I would say it's one of the most speculative plays in the steel sector, win big or lose big type of play.

**STLD**

https://preview.redd.it/eq7p6cngmph61.jpg?width=375&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=302c250198eff734be70ce80684eb738713d715a

Now, this is more reasonable. Rock-solid balance sheet, that pays a fkg dividend (Imagine caring about a dividend of 2.5% though lol) and is trading at an impressive 46% below ""fair value"", again using a simple DCF model (if anybody wants to add another way of valuing this shit please do, I suck at coming up with price targets, I'm just copying [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st) estimates here). Won't probably move as fast as X though 😐.

**MT**

https://preview.redd.it/8udchr6oqph61.jpg?width=370&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=831dd6798b54cb436aedb8bede5b74ccb4a799ed

Steel Gang knows this one well, and there's already DD on it, so go check it out.

**VALE**

Well, I stand with the Knights of Vale, and that is all I have to say. There's enough DD out there to confirm all of your biases, so I'll just say it's a good long-term play. Go read the DD.

**SLX**

VanEck Vectors ETF Trust Steel ETF. Honestly, I have never used it, it doesn't look very option liquid, so I wouldn't dip in it, but if you absolutely love ETFs there is one.

# Silver Sector

Let's not overlook silver's worth just because there's a ton of shilling going on. There are the people that believe the dollar will be worthless and the financial system will collapse, and then there are the people that legit think silver is a good commodity play. I think it's not only a good commodity play but also a good industrial play. As opposed to Gold, which is purely an inflation hedge at best, silver has actual industrial applications. Anyway, you know the tickers for silver, there's been more than enough shilling on them.

# Copper Sector

Copper, being an excellent electrical conductor, will likely have the most intense rally amongst metals in the coming years. The EV industry especially, but all other industries that will strive to go fully electrical and clean will demand huge quantities of it. Think of all the electrical wiring, revolutionary battery tech (like the one Elon showed on battery day \*PTSD sets in\*), as well as other industrial applications. For what it's worth, Goldman Sachs is most bullish on copper. Fun fact: Copper surfaces kill most viruses, including the Rona, faster than other surfaces like plastic. Do with that info what you will.

**TRQ**

Now, this one makes me rock hard. Earnings are forecasted to grow 30% per year. On top of the huge growth prospects, it's currently undervalued at around 67%. 67%! And that's using the boomer valuation model that is DCF. Big value right here imo.

This one is a sexy beast. Excellent balance sheet, very good growth prospect, proven track record, and at a 55% discount using DCF model. But, of course, there's a but: it's only on the TSX, and while it has options, they don't look liquid at all. I'm a canuck so I can trade it, but yeah it's only on the Toronto Exchange...

**COPX**

It's the Copper ETF, and it has no options. Meh

Ok, so that's it for the tickers. To be honest, there are probably better ones, but I spent most of my time working on the overall macro thesis and wasn't planning to add any tickers initially and then changed my mind. Again, if you have suggestions please comment. These tickers are just the most popular and highest momentum names, they are not the hidden gems.

EDIT: Ok so I just had this idea by stumbling on somebody's comment just now. Somehow people think Biden is a warmonger. Well, the US hasn't had a good war in some time now. The Afghanistan war is still going on, not really going anywhere, and not being expensive enough to have any meaningful economic consequences. Meanwhile, tensions with Russia and China keep escalating. A war would be just about the last piece of the puzzle for the commodity super-cycle thesis. It would certainly cause massive inflation as demand for industrial metals and other commodities skyrockets, given the war effort resource reallocations. Historically, this is one of the conditions, so I think it's something to keep in mind going forward.

EDIT 2: wtf is going on with silver? All metals are up today 16/02/2021, silver and gold down. Gold I get it, silver I don't fkg get it. It has industrial applications, there is a current SHORTAGE??? Are people just not paying attention, is this just algos smacking the price down? I get the manipulation for silver futures, it's not new, but what about miners? AG and others... this is whack af. I'm doubling down on silver, it will come back to its senses eventually, it has too.

74,"SILVER, the investment that has no risk and infinite possibilities! DD on $PSLV and more!🚀",None,0.49,Woetz_B,"Ok no risk might be clickbait, no investment is fully risk-free but I still stand buy my point: buy silver, let me explain:

Silver massively undervalued and like GME it's possible to fuck with Wall street if it squeezes. A silver squeeze you ask? Isn't the silver market too big to squeeze? Silver ETF SLV (which is a scam) admits it's possible and that they're vulnerable to one. [http://gata.org/node/20913](http://gata.org/node/20913)

How is a squeeze possible then? Let me quote a Bloomberg article of 2014 to explain:  ""About $5 trillion of silver and $18 trillion of gold circulated globally last year, according to CPM Group"". $5 trillion dollar you say... After a quick search on the internet you will find that both total supply and total demand for silver hovers around 1 billion ounces a year. [https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/](https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/) This would mean that in 2014 (when the price was around $20 per ounce) the true circulating supply was $20 billion, a difference of 250 times! This difference is what we call 'paper silver' and just like paper hands it sucks, driving down the price. 

If the price of silver increases massively, those who create paper silver will lose a lot of money, and if it keeps rising it's just a matter of time before futures and fake ETF's will stop providing it. If that happens the price of silver will inevitably rise way further as supply will decrease up to 250x!

BTW: In the near past JPM was punished for manipulating the silver market as well, just a sign that stuff like this happens to a market this big.

ATTENTION  **🌈🐻** :

Are your expectations on the market negative? Do you think stock prices will fall? Do you believe we are in a bubble? I found the perfect investment: Silver! After the great recession and the short crash last year silver crashed quickly before it rose to the occasion. In 2008 it crashed a bit, only to rise almost 5x afterwards. In 2020 it dropped to appox $12 an ounce and rose to nearly $30. If you think the stock market will crash, this is a great opportunity.

Ok, now that the **🌈🐻** are interested, we can continue.

Time lag is a phenomenon in economics where there is a delay between an action and a consequence. Right now we are in the middle of this. As silver is sold in many forms (Physical, ETF, Trust, Futures) it's prone to price lag. Look at your local Bullion dealer. Are there many coins/bars in stock? Probably not, and the price has hardly increased last month. By buying trusts that actually own silver like $PSLV and $PHAG you can profit off this phenomenon.

READ IF YOU'RE A BOOMER:

Silver is actually a great long-term investment. It is important for many technologies we will see a lot of in the future. Think about batteries, solar panels and medicine. With the market for all of these 3 increasing quickly. This could be sped up by the US government if the current administration starts funding projects for renewable energy and electric cars. Also, in 10 years we will see a peak in Silver mining, but after that there will most likely be a decline in supply until the mines are almost completely empty. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344913002747#sec0080](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344913002747#sec0080) 

Important sidenote: If you want to profit of a possible squeeze you can also look into buying stock of silver miners. These will obviously rise a lot if the price of silver goes to what it should be worth. 

Conclusion: There are many possible scenarios imaginable in which silver prices will rise a lot, both in the short and long term. Buying silver futures does nothing, nor will buying $SLV. Buy physical silver or silver trusts which market values are the same as the amount of silver in their vault! 

TL;DR: 

Is this really needed? Buy silver!!  🚀  🚀  🚀 (NOT SLV)

75,$T - AT&T Short Term Bull Thesis - Insider Trading Galore,837,0.91,FluxRevived,"What's poppin' fellow degenerate gamblers. This is going to be my first attempt at writing DD in my entire fuckin life, so please, give it a read and let me know what you all think! I've attached a TLDR at the bottom for those who are a little retarded, and a TLDR of the TLDR for those who are illiterate.

&nbsp;


**__Background__**

What initially caught my eye about this entire play, was the [large influx of OTM call options being written for AT&T at the 30C and 30.5C strikes, dated for 03/05](https://imgur.com/vZLHCJ6). These contracts started popping up at the start of the month, and then exploded February 10th and 11th. What makes these calls so odd is the nature of AT&T; It's a boomer dividend stock. It experiences little to no volatility. It's a behemoth with an insanely large market cap. $T is extremely resilient to big moves, so why are so many options contracts so far OTM (*in relation to T*) being gobbled up? Someone with a deep pockets, and potentially a crystal ball, is betting insane amounts of money on $T to go above $30.5 (a roughly 6% increase at the time of writing) within the next three weeks.

&nbsp;

I had a few theories as to what may be going on, but was ultimately unsure of what to make of these unusual flows, so I decided to keep it at the back of my mind, and start to look for answers.

&nbsp;

**__Catalyst #1 : AST SpaceMobile__**

To those who don't know, SpaceMobile is the first and only space-based cellular broadband network able to be accessible by standard smartphones. SpaceMobile will effectively be able to provide both 4G and 5G connectivity to your phone ANYWHERE on the planet. AT&T has been in talks with AST about using their satellite network to provide 5G to their users, which I think is pretty nifty. Nothing has been confirmed yet, however, an FCC filing over the summer hinted at a commercial agreement. AST says that they plan on providing North American coverage for AT&T as early as ""Phase 2"" of their satellite launch. Overall, I think this is a pretty awesome deal, as the technology ensures that all AT&T cellular dead zones in North America would be effectively eliminated, making AT&T more attractive than it’s competitors in the consumer cell phone market. Could this warrant a jump in price? Absolutely.

&nbsp;

**__Catalyst #2 : 5G Airwave Auction__**

Every time someone accesses the internet through their smartphone, their wireless carrier transmits that data through the airwaves on frequencies that *only it* has the license to use. Currently, there is an active auction (Auction 107) for air-wave licenses within the 5G spectrum band that has netted a record grand total of $81 billion dollars from various big players in the industry, such as Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, etc. Bidding concluded on Friday, January 15th, with winning bidders having the opportunity to further bid for frequency-specific licenses in the assignment phase, which began on Monday, February 8, 2021. The larger the portion of 5G spectrum a company acquires, the better situated they'll be when 5G becomes the new normal standard among consumers. The performance jump from 5G is going to be so dramatic, that if carriers are not in that game they’re going to get left behind. On January 31st, it was revealed that once the assignment phase is completed in the *coming weeks*, the winners will be announced. Coincidentally, this lines up right before the expiration of these options, leading me to believe the call buyer(s) could be betting that AT&T won a large slice of the spectrum, easily warranting the needed 6% jump.

&nbsp;

**__Catalyst #3 : PLTR Partnership__**

Here is where things start to get a little spicy. It is rumored that PLTR and AT&T have signed a partnership agreement. As asinine as it sounds, these claims are easily backed up. PLTR and AT&T seem to have been in talks about collaborating for a bit, [as leaked by an employee on LinkedIn](https://i.redd.it/of9onix9izg61.png). The employee alludes to the fact that he was a key person in getting PLTR approved by the AT&T chief data office, with the timing and duration of his position reinforcing the fact that the contract is still fairly new. Furthermore, there have been a large magnitude of job postings from AT&T in Texas, that had PLTR as a high preferred / necessary qualification. This brings us to out next lead.

&nbsp;

Luxoft, a large Digital Strategy Consulting firm, has a newly posted Data Analyst role in Plano, Texas. [Some key takeaways from the posting](https://www.dice.com/jobs/detail/data-analyst-luxoft-usa-inc-plano-tx-75023/newageny/6846840) :

&nbsp;

• Our client is looking to Luxoft for help to scale the deployment timeline of a network ticketing and orchestration system into **five new centers**.

• This person would analyze Network operations center data via PowerBI and on the **Palantir platform**.

• Under ""Mandatory"" skills, there's **""Worked in Palantir or other big data analytics platforms""**

• Under ""Nice-to-have"" skills, there's **"" Experience in telecommunication industry""**

&nbsp;

So we know that Luxoft wants someone with PLTR experience, to scale and deploy some form of network into five new centres, in Plano, Texas. If we go to the Plano Economic Development website, [we find an incredibly important article](https://www.planotexas.org/269/ATT-launches-new-innovation-center-in-Pl). The key takeaway from it, is that :

&nbsp;

• ""**AT&T announced plans to open new innovation centers in Atlanta and Plano, Texas, to open in coming months, giving it a total of five such centers worldwide**""

&nbsp;

As a result, we can conclude that the undisclosed Luxoft client is AT&T, and that the new system they are looking to deploy across five new centers are the new AT&T innovation centers, the first of which is the one located in Plano, Texas, where all of the hiring is taking place. To top it all off, there was a recently posted position at AT&T, looking for people for their Professional [Advanced Analytics - Operations Transformation program, located in Plano, Texas](https://www.att.jobs/job/plano/professional-advanced-analytics-operations-transformation/117/18772894).

&nbsp;

Given Palantir’s meme power, and excitement for the future, a partnership could provide very beneficial to both companies, resulting in a swift upward trajectory to AT&Ts underlying price as well.

&nbsp;

**__Bearish Counterpoints__**

AT&T is under a mountain of debt (The most of any publicly traded company), and they're losing subscribers from DirectTV and cable faster than they projected, further adding to this issue. At the same time, for them to keep up with 5G, they're to pay additional billions in a spectrum auction and then need to pay many billions more to roll out 5G. From a financial standpoint, this is a massive red-flag, but with interest-rates still at 0, it is unlikely do be an immediate issue, especially with the shorter dated March contracts. Another thing to consider is that AT&T is a behemoth of a company. It's been trading in the 28$-30$ range since the dawn of time. PLTR Partnering with T may very well be akin to a fly landing on an aircraft carrier. Although its everyone's favorite meme stock with a promising future, the partnership may ultimately end up being negligible in the movement of AT&T's stock price. The same could be said for any of the above catalysts, so please, proceed with caution.

&nbsp;

**__Conclusion__**

With such a large number of potential catalysts, combined with the extremely cheap price of the contracts (10$ a pop at the time of writing), I feel like this offer is a little too good to pass up. Best case scenario, you hit a multi-bagger. Worst case scenario, you don't buy Wendy's for lunch on Wednesday and vow never to touch boomer stocks. I hope you all enjoyed this comprehensive DD on the unusual options flow of AT&T. If you would like to follow me for future DD, you can either DM me, or find my socials linked below in the comments, or on my profile :)

&nbsp;

**__TLDR__**

AT&T has been experiencing some insanely large magnitudes of unusual options flow. Whales are gobbling up $T 2021-03-05 C $30 and $30.5 like candy. This is likely due to them having insider information regarding one of the potential catalysts. AT&T  either partnered with AST SpaceMobile to eliminate cellular dead zones in their network, won the bidding war and managed to gain a favorable monopoly on the 5G airwave infrastructure, or partnered with none other than PLTR for an upcoming super project.

&nbsp;

**__TLDR of TLDR__**

• Buy **$T 2021-03-05 C $30** OR **$30.5**

76,"RKT DD Part II: A former employee's take on Rocket's Culture and how it will allow them to become the ""Amazon of financial services.""",369,0.88,The_Big_Short_2020,"**\*Disclaimer\*** this is a 15-minute read. I’ve seen a lot of posts on Rocket, but no posts focus on their culture. A lot of posts explain ***what*** they're doing, but this one will explain ***how*** they're doing it.

In RKT DD Part One, I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap. *Refer to RKT DD Part 1 Below:*

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but\_analysts\_say\_rkt\_isnt\_a\_buy\_no\_shit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but_analysts_say_rkt_isnt_a_buy_no_shit/)

In RKT DD part II, I will discuss the single reason I have such an oversized position in RKT.

The single reason my bullishness and conviction has not wavered since IPO is because of Rocket’s **company culture** – which I was lucky to witness firsthand while working at Rocket from 2013 to 2015. Based on my experience, Rocket’s culture is the reason no insider selling took place following their lock-up expiration period on Feb. 2. Rocket employees, especially their executives, don’t view Rocket as just a company. They view Rocket almost as a religion, which shapes their belief system and influences how they work and live.

In a 2017 Harvard Business Review article, the author discusses how effective cultures oftentimes require shocking rules in order to produce shocking results. The first two companies he discusses are none other than AMZN and RKT. After living Rocket’s culture and researching Amazon’s – it is astonishing how similar both cultures are. *Article Link Below:*

[https://hbr.org/2019/12/to-build-a-strong-culture-create-rules-that-are-unique-to-your-company](https://hbr.org/2019/12/to-build-a-strong-culture-create-rules-that-are-unique-to-your-company)

Both AMZN and RKT are not defined by what they do, but rather who they are. Amazon’s culture is what allows them to be in various industries all while maintaining their identity. Culture is the glue that unifies every part of Amazon’s diverse business together. Culture is the same unifying factor that allows Rocket Founder, Dan Gilbert to own and operate over 100 companies (15 of which are under $RKT).

# Introduction to RKT’s “ISMs” and “ISMs Day”

Rocket’s culture is based around 20 “ISMs” (aka philosophies) which serve as guiding principles. I will admit that these principles are obvious, and many companies likely have similar ones. But companies’ values are meaningless unless they are embedded into the company’s day-to-day norms.

Gilbert indoctrinates new hires by devoting 8 hours every three weeks to host **“ISMs day.”** ISMs day is a day-long seminar hosted by Dan Gilbert and Jay Farner for new employees to help them understand the deeper meaning of Rocket’s core values. Gilbert spends the entire day explaining how these values allowed him to transform himself from a pizza delivery boy to the owner of an empire with a net worth of $50B. They even hand out an ISMs books which are essentially corporate bibles. I kid you not, if you make a mistake at work, some directors will make you read out of the ISMs book as if you were repenting for your Anti-ISM sins.

As a former United States Army captain, I can tell you that Rocket’s first 4 months of indoctrination was almost as effective as the Army’s 11-week Basic Combat Training course held at Ft. Benning, GA. Dan Gilbert understands psych 101 and how to effectively use it to produce his army of soldiers.

# “Every Client, Every Time - No Exception, No Excuses”

Like AMZN, standards are very high at RKT, especially when it comes to customer service. If it is discovered that an employee failed to reply to a customer’s email or phone call on the same day, then they will receive a “no return call complaint” (NRCC). No matter if you’ve been with the company for 15 years or 15 days – if you get three NRCCs, then you are automatically fired, on the spot, “…no exceptions, no excuses.”

My most memorable moment of **“every client every time no exception no excuses”** was when I failed to call back a customer who did not qualify for a mortgage. The denied customer called the hotline in search of his banker (me). Three hours after he was routed to my phone, I got an email from former Rocket Companies CEO Bill Emerson inquiring on the incident – he even CC’d Dan Gilbert. **That’s right boys and girls, I was on the same email chain as Uncle Dan himself, getting bitched at by the former CEO of RKT** (The former CEO would run circles around Jay Farner).

The former CEO didn’t go through the president of mortgage banking who would then go through the regional vice president, who would then go through my director and then to me – he cut out all the bureaucratic layers to discover why I failed on one of their guiding principles. *(Rocket HATES red-tape bureaucratic layers; it is not in line with their culture and they prefer a flat hierarchy).* The RKT CEO even had a 5-minute call with my director as a follow up. CEO Bill Emerson dropped everything he was doing because nothing was more important than one of Rocket’s guiding principles: **“every client, every time, no exceptions, no excuses.”**

&#x200B;

# “It’s Not About Who Is Right, But What Is Right”

All individuals within Rocket Companies are held to the same standards defined by the company’s ISMs. It doesn’t matter if you are a lowly janitor or a Regional Vice President with a corner office view. Dan Gilbert formed a flat hierarchy reflected in another ISM, **“It’s not who is right, but what is right.”** I have witnessed a Regional Vice President of Mortgage Banking get double demoted to a banker solely because he started to arrive 20 minutes late to work every other day, for a few weeks in a row. Those 20 minutes are a big deal because at Rocket **“Every Second Counts” (another ISM).**

During my first ISMs day, Gilbert and former CEO Bill Emerson further proved they were a flat hierarchy when they gave their personal cell phones to the audience of hundreds of newly hired employees. Dan did this to drive home the importance of customer service within Rocket’s culture.

*“if you guys ever get too busy to return a customer’s phone call – let either of us know and we will call them for you,”* said Gilbert.

Of course, no one was stupid enough to do this, but we knew it was meant to drive home their message on **customer focus**.

I witnessed many employees let go for little things like this. It served as a reminder that either you lived the ISMs or you left the company. Leadership understood toxic attitudes were contagious, so they would quickly remove the cancer before it could spread to other teammates. If you quit the company and tried to give them your two weeks, they would decline and then show you the door. I am talking The Office, Michael Scott to Toby style exit.

# “Ignore the Noise”

ISMs exerted such a strong force on me, that even my parents and friends accused Rocket of being a cult – but instead of listening to them, I would **“Ignore the noise,”** which is an ISM that means, ignore the “naysayers” and never let them stop you from success. There will always be noise in our lives – but the truly successful are able to ignore it and complete the task ahead.

I was legitimately offended when people accused Rocket of being a cult. They didn’t understand that hard work and hustle was required for the finer things in life. Rocket made us proud of the work ethic it instilled, so we took it personal when an outsider insulted the empire Dan had built. The same empire that is now single handedly saving the City of Detroit. We didn’t understand why people would bad-mouth a company who gave young, non-college educated kids the chance to make $20,000 a month in exchange for hard work. RKT strategically empowered those who were never empowered, in exchange for their utmost loyalty and devotion to the company (more on that later).

I also remember when **“ignore the noise”** was used against me. I complained to a co-worker about working another Saturday and instead of agreeing with me, he looked at me with an almost robot-like stare and said, “**ignore the noise,** man.” Rocket had programmed him; he wanted no part in speaking ill toward the company that shaped his belief system.

# “We Are The They”

Rocket was able to create a culture so strong that the employees within Rocket looked at the company as an extension of themselves. Any negative remark against the company, was a negative remark against the individual employee, which is why I took it personal when people accused Rocket of being a cult. **“We are the they”** was an effective ISM designed to unify the individuals within Rocket as one. **“We are the they”** means that there is no “they.” The “they” is all of us. “**We Are The They”**: One team. United. All in the mission together.

# Action-oriented ISMs (i.e. “Innovation is rewarded but execution is worshipped,” “we’ll figure it out,” “Every Second Counts”)

Rocket’s ISMs are a roadmap designed to destroy the conventional bureaucratic BS that is so common in legacy companies like General Motors or IBM. Don’t you hate when you have hour long meeting at work and by the end, no decision was ever made? Rocket loves ideas. Employees can even email Dan Gilbert directly (flat hierarchy) when you have an idea. But Rocket places more emphasis on action out lined in ISMs above. At Rocket they realize you cannot cross every “t” and dot every “I” before launching a new innovative idea. If you did, progress would never be made – they emphasized that employees **“figure it out”** by doing and trusting the idea and refining along the way. A crucial step in acquiring and growing separate businesses and ideas.

It’s not just the customer-facing bankers that carry the ethos. Every. Single. Person. in the company, responds with a sense of urgency.

Now you “naysayers” might be asking how do I know if Rocket’s culture still is this way and that it extends to every part of the company. I left Rocket in 2015, and I am now a supplier for them. I deal with their facility management department and they are just as on the ball as their customer-facing bank force. They respond to my emails the quickest, out of any of my 400 customers. It is apparent that their culture runs deep and extends throughout the entire company, not just their sales team.

What happens if you are not on the ball? Simple: you are fired. This company is on the **lunatic fringe** of perfection. The same amount of perfection that Amazon demands, which is outlined in one of Amazon’s 14 leadership principles “Insist on the Highest Standards.”

# Who Does Rocket Hire and why?

Rocket hires anyone and everyone. Gilbert also strategically hires underdogs. He doesn’t care if you have a college degree, high school degree or neither – he hires almost anyone to see if they fit into the culture he created. If not, they are fired at a moment’s notice.

His way of hiring non-college educated kids, who somewhat embody Detroit, is genius. The non-college educated, young 20-year old’s are given a second chance: a chance to make easily over 6-figures. Keep in mind that these are kids who worked jobs such as bartenders or waitresses before Rocket took a chance on them.

Non-college educated employees typically promote faster than the college educated ones.

Why? Because these employees understand that no other company will compensate them the way Rocket does. Rocket empowers those who have never been empowered in exchange for their full devotion to the company and its philosophies. They are the ambassadors of Dan’s ISMs.

# How have these ISMs changed me and Detroit?

These ISMs not only transformed me into a more effective employee, but equally they transformed me into a very entitled customer when I was outside of work. Whenever I got bad service, I would become irritated. Rocket had programmed me on how service was supposed to be and that anything short of perfection was unacceptable. I didn’t realize how truly special and impactful Rocket’s culture was until I left and worked for another fortune 500 company. Its true: leaders either create a culture, or the culture will create itself.

Rocket also used the location of its headquarters as a symbol of hard work and resiliency. In 2010, at the height of the recession, Detroit’s unemployment was 3x the national average. Nothing was in downtown Detroit at the time. Detroit went from the richest city in the world in the 1950s to the symbol of tragedy at the beginning of the 21st century. When companies were leaving Detroit during the height of the recession, Dan Gilbert was going against the traffic and moving his entire team from Livonia, Michigan to the heart of downtown Detroit.

I can’t explain to you the difference Dan Gilbert has made in downtown Detroit. Everyone laughed at Dan’s decision to move Rocket Companies to downtown Detroit – but Dan followed two ISMs **“Yes before no”** and **“you have to believe it to see it.”**

They doubted Dan’s ability to revitalize downtown Detroit just as they doubted his ability to issue mortgage loans virtually on the internet in the 1990s, just as they doubted his idea to perform the mortgage process on only an app, with no loan officer, in 2015. The same way they doubted Gilbert could win an NBA championship with one of the worst sports teams in the league (do you notice a trend?)

The same way they doubt Dan Gilbert will be able to f\*\*ck the shorts who are driving down his stock.

They’re also now laughing at Dan’s vision to turn Detroit into the fintech hub of the world. But Dan follows **“you have to believe it, to see it”** to the T. And his bold actions inspire his army of soldiers who wear the Rocket badge around their neck.

Following the 2010 move, Detroit has become Rocket’s symbol – it has totally transformed the company and its employees to have an underdog mentality with the hunger to prove itself.

The character of the city — its grit, resilience, and fortitude — gave the company mythology for the brand and its founder. This has been a part of the storytelling mechanism by which Rocket evangelizes itself to the market…both locally and beyond; and it’s quite powerful.

# Why is Rocket’s Culture important?

Rocket is more than a company; it is a belief system that unites 20,000 employees to a common goal. This belief system allows for many strangers to cooperate effectively – just as the belief system of religion connects millions across the globe.

Culture isn’t about what gets done, but how it gets done. Rocket’s belief system can apply to any industry, not just mortgages. That’s why Gilbert pounds into his employee’s heads:

*“it’s not what we do, it’s who we are that defines us.”*

It’s why Gilbert went public: he wants to compete with silicon valley and incentivize software programmers to join his religion by offering stock options. He wants to use RKT stock as currency to acquire other fintech companies and have them adopt his unifying culture which has brought him to where he is today.

It’s why he owns all the historic buildings in the heart of downtown Detroit. Yes, there's a part of this that is about community and altruism, but it is also about business. It would be much harder for RKT to capitalize on it’s business plan to create the Amazon of financial services if their companies were spread out across different suburbs. By owning the majority of Downtown Detroit (which he does), Rocket is able to capitalize on talent and the millennial trend to work in urban cores all while creating a synergistic energy among Rocket’s multiple companies which will further revitalize Detroit in the process.

I see why those looking from the outside in think that Rocket is just a mortgage company. But those that work there understand mortgages are just the start of Rocket’s empire. Trust me, but as Dan Gilbert would say, you have to **“believe it, to see it.**

Gilbert's empire is just getting started.

*don't know why my screenshot doesn't show on reddit, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/2YvrkR0 

&#x200B;

Firstly, I want to thank everyone who commented constructively yesterday on [my initial AMC DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljz99b/amc_blockbuster_dd/). A lot of good input and questions. I thought it'd be best to try and summarize/address a lot of the concerns raised in a second DD, where I can get more into the details, in advance of the market opening tomorrow.

This sequel DD is split in Fundamentals and Mementals. A tl;dr is at the top of each section. At the bottom you'll find my thoughts on catalysts and forward momentum drivers. You don't have to agree, that's just how I see things. I'm not trying to convince anyone. My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40 price. For those who wonder why I didn't sell at the squeeze: I bought the shares before the stock started mooning and had sold covered calls. It was too expensive to get out of them, so I was rolling them up. Unfortunately for me, the squeeze subsided before I could extract myself from the calls, so I'm still in, and at a substantial unrealized profit as well. **My horizon is up to the end of 2021 the latest, so I'm only assessing the potential for the share price to go up until then** \- I'm not in it for years. I'll probably sell some CSPs in the meantime and if it stabilizes higher by June or earlier I'll sell some CCs for income.

I'll preface this DD by saying that in 2020, and it looks like in 2021 as well, fundamentals don't mean much one way or another in my opinion. It's pure moment trading in the market from what I gather and everything is overvalued. Every-fucking-thing is overvalued, so saying that a company's fundamentals aren't that great means shit when you got stocks with $bn market caps which have never turned a profit, have no product and won't sell anything for years to come. Investors are looking for what's least overvalued, or what may benefit from momentum over the next few weeks/months and jump on it as soon as possible. Today 2/15 the markets were closed in N.America, but Europe was open and anything related to post-Covid normalcy skyrocketed. All leisure/travel stocks mooned even though noone is travelling yet. I do really expect something like this will be happening in the american stock market very soon, if not immediately, as well. People will try to position themselves for the post-covid times as sentiment shifts to positive. I expect big rotations out of tech stocks and likewise into leisure/travel/socializing and back-to-business stocks. I do think AMC is one of the beneficiaries, irrespective of fundamentals or not.

Finally, all my figures are taken from the company's own annual report unless stated otherwise.

&#x200B;

# Fundamentals:

**tl;dr = if AMC does not change strategy it will stagnate and it's share price will not move much. I think $5 is the bottom anyways so getting in at this price point is fairly low risk. Should the price drop more after buying in you can make up the difference with CCs over a few months. Should it stay where it's at, again, selling CCs is a nice way to make money. But don't sell CCs just yet, because when it rallies you'll be trapped. Wait until it's price stabilizes.**

Onto the details:

Let's get something out of the way really quickly. AMC reaching meme status did not do anything for its solvency. Nothing, nada, 0. AMC had managed to raised capital through debt and equity BEFORE it became a meme, so shut up with that bullshit and google the timelines. Their CEO had announced that bankruptcy is off the table way before the stock took off.

&#x200B;

Some share prices for your pleasure and education:

[chart from IBKR](https://preview.redd.it/1x6u00gl0qh61.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d6a517d3b01e3f2a85380e6d2b058d160fb5335)

*again, the chart I uploaded to reddit doesn't show up on my end, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/VwK58BR 

**Highlights:**

Mar 2015: **$35** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Jan 2015: **$22** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end

Dec 2016: **$35** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end

March 2017: **$31.5** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end

Aug 2017: **$13** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end (20.3m shares issued in Feb at @ $31.5)

Sept 2018: **$21** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end (retired 24m shares in Sept @ $17.5)

July 2019: **$9.5** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end

&#x200B;

The above is some food for thought for those who say that AMC has diluted itself so much the price will stay forever low. As you see, the AMC share price has fluctuated wildly despite being diluted in the past, and despite revenues and profits not growing much. Therefore anyone who says this will go to $1 because of debt or dilution is talking out of their ass and is too ashamed to say they are a bear. The price has gone up and down despite being diluted and borrowing increasing, and it will go up and down again. The question is what will drive it either way.

&#x200B;

Shares dilution from 2020 onwards:

* Feb 21st 2020: 52.5m Class A and 51.7m Class B
* Jan 2021: 287m Class A and 51.8m Class B
* Jan 2021: 44.4m shares added due to convertible bonds sold as shares
* 2/15/21 estimated shares outstanding are: 287m+51.8m+44.4m = 383.2m (my estimate, could be wrong)

Note: there is a difference between shares outstanding and float. Float is what is available to buy in the market, which is of interest when you start thinking about short interest.

&#x200B;

According to the following sites:

* [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)
* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/)
* [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults\_companyquotes](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults_companyquotes)
* [https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock)

Float is between 56.1m to 115m depending on where you look.

Btw, they all quote shares outstanding as 287m, so maybe I'm double counting something?

&#x200B;

Short interest:

According to these sites the short interest ranges from:

* [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/)
* [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm)
* [https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)
* [https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest](https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest)

37.7m shares and some quote 79% of float. Clearly a lot of sites are calculating float as 56.1m.

If anyone has any official sources on short interest it'd be great to see. In any case, I'm not advocating that this will be short squeezed. That has nothing to do with my thesis. On 2/25 the Q4 ER is taking place so we'll have a definitive answer on shares outstanding.

**Tickets, sales, customers:**

2019 = 356m consumers

2019 = NYC, LA and Chicago represent 17% of USA total box office. AMC holds 39% market share there.

&#x200B;

[2019 annual report](https://preview.redd.it/mxpbc9wp0qh61.png?width=1664&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bcac6e37fa3fa23c30d671ac3a42c8ddb859237)

*The image I uploaded may not show up. Another link:*  https://imgur.com/WARXMTh 

It appears that there are y.o.y fluctuations on attendance. Adjusting the 2010 box office revenue for inflation ([https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/)) would result in 2019 sales of $12.5bn, when real sales were $11.4bn. Therefore, when adjusted for inflation the box office sales are not keeping up. However, it's worth noting that neither the ticket price nor the indoor screens have increased by inflation, and looking at the figures AMC is making more money per screen. I believe the reason why box office sales haven't kept up to inflation is because the strategy for theatres has been stale. I also want to believe that COVID has been a wake up call for the theatre industry to diversity and execute on more bold strategies, which combined with cost cutting measures should pay off going forward.

**Competition:**

2019 annual report = the 3 largest exhibitors are AMC, Regal (now bought out and turned private) and Cinemark, which account for 60% of box office revenues. Back in 2000 they accounted for 35% of revenues, so there is substantial consolidation happening.

Non-theatrical competition is of course the streaming services, cable tv, pay-per-view etc. In reality it's only streaming services as pay-per-view and cable tv is dead as a dodo.

Current (2021) peers are IMAX, Regal and Cinemark.

**Ops:**

2019 annual report: 1,004 theatres (636 in US) and 11,041 screens (8,094 in US). The rest are in Europe and Saudi Arabia. Market leader in USA and Europe.

26% of their revenue comes from int'l market. Europe is reopening fast and the UK GBP (biggest int'l market for AMC) is increasing in value, which in combo with a weak US dollar will bolster revenue figures.

A lot of people commented on AMC not making money and that it's doomed etc. Looking at their financials:

&#x200B;

[https://preview.redd.it/4am3oenr0qh61.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e](https://preview.redd.it/4am3oenr0qh61.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e)

*The original image uploaded doesn't seem to show up, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/Gx9Ded6 

It seems to me that the biggest bummers with regard to their operating income have been rent and Opex. Rent expenses went up purely due to accounting standards, but the end result is that it made their EBITDA look worse. Should accounting treatment rules had not changed their 2019 EBITDA would have been very close to 2018.

*Note: in one of my responses to a comment in my previous DD I erroneously suggested (that's what I thought) that the capex servicing and SG&A were what was dragging them down, but that seems to remain stable year on year - which are of course dragging them down, but are not what causes fluctuations in their yearly profitability.*

Now, we know that AMC has done a lot of work to keep rent costs down, and has done massive strides to reduce OPEX. Hence why I strongly think the profitability margins will improve going forward, all else remaining equal. Just look at the int'l markets where OPEX was the reverse (4.3% down y.o.y) and how it made all the difference in their bottom line. Add to that the fact they have gotten rid of a lot of underperforming screens. OPEX should go further down as everyone gets vaccinated and any additional spending on COVID sanitizing is no longer necessary.

**Capex:**

Between 2015-2019 AMC has built 37 new theatres with 310 new screens and bought out 700 theatres and 6,500 screens. They have doubled their capacity in 5 years. That's a lot of CAPEX spending, and obviously a lot of borrowing to deliver that.

Capital spending was $0.5bn in 2019, $0.6bn in 2018 and $0.6bn in 2017. This is resulting to about $300m cash outflows to serve that capex, per year from 2020 and onwards.

It appears that capital spending has stopped, so at least no more new servicing costs.

**Debt:**

2019 = $4.8bn

2020 (9/30): $5.82bn, but we know that in 2021 about $600m was converted to shares, so debt should be about $5.2bn currently. Again, if I've missed any bonds let me know.

**Comparables:**

Price to Book (ttm) and 5yr avrg:

AMC -0.26 / 1.16

MSGE 0.85 / 0.63

CNK 2.41 / 3.12

IMAX 3.34 / 3.54

AMC has the lowest valued share price amongst its competitors, therefore appears the cheapest across the peers. It also trades far lower compares to its 5yr average compared to its peers. Should the tide change it should see its price equalize to the others then there is a great upside. You may say that AMC has a lot of debt etc., well the rest are not in a much better position, with CNK being screwed with Regal for instance.

&#x200B;

# Mementals:

**tl;dr: A lot of positive catalysts await, and every single piece of news will boost the price. Aside a resurge of COVID there is nothing stopping people returning to the theatres, and a slew of blockbusters will be coming out soon to entice them. A change of strategy should also help add some growth to the revenue which will only boost prices further.**

If we were to ignore fundamentals, like the rest of the market does, then we need to look at AMCs potential for popping, squeezing or rallying. I'll start by saying I don't think a short squeeze is in the books. I just doubt it. There's a lot of confusion around its short interest and float. What I do know is that the float has increased a lot compared to early 2020, but it appears that short interest has increased as well. I don't think that shorts have covered to a large extent since mid-Jan and I can see - through checking the IBKR availability of shares to borrow - that shorts are hitting it every day. It's worth noting that its share price is now 100%+ higher than were it was when they were shorting it, so who knows, but I don't count on it.

What I'm thinking is catalysts that will push the price upwards. I do expect that people are just gagging to go back to the cinema. That's not going to change once things reopen. Things that I expect will make the price rally:

\- COVID vaccine roll-out proceeds well and movie studios decide to finally start releasing movies. That should happen once capacity restrictions are lifted at movie theatres. There will be a big marketing push around this in the news.

\- NYC and LA announcing the reopening of theatres at full capacity. This will happen and will happen soon. It will lift the price by a lot as those two are the price revenue makers for AMC.

\- Partnership with a major streaming service. Netflix, Amazon or Disney, or even bought up by a major movie studio. The synergies are insane and the worst case scenario for those giants' balance sheets is negligible. Streaming service subscription numbers are stagnating and streaming giants are forced to increase prices (hi Netflix) to make up for growth. Expanding through an acquisition of AMC makes sense to reach out and grow further. It'll be like Amazon buying up Walmart. Low chance but even chatter about it will push the price up fast.

\- Summer (and Xmas) are the prime seasons where studios release movies. This summer should be huge in terms of releases and times well with the reopening of theatres. This is guaranteed.

\- Wanda converted their shares and is no longer the controlling shareholder. This allows substantial more maneouvering ability to the executive team to do things differently.

\- COVID restrictions lifted sooner than expected. This will allow AMC to use the cash pile it has squirreled for a tough 2021 in repaying debt faster, reducing interest expenses and improving its net income. Any announcement around retiring debt will push the price up.

\- More strategic changes towards PVOD, eSPORTS, booking theatres to people through apps etc. to utilize all the spare seating capacity. Even at peak revenue AMC is only using 17% of its seats, so it's got a lot of idle capacity it can make money off with 0 additional costs. AMC should pivot to additional offerings on top of movie releases to capture more footfall in its screens. I do believe that COVID was a wake up call that will push them to more innovative ways of generating revenue.

\- As people return to theatres they will realize a lot of locals have shut down. There will be consolidation due to natural causes. Fewer screens but the same number of movie-goers. That's a benefit for AMC.

\- With sentiment improving around the economy reopening a lot of these stocks that were hit hard by Covid will get extreme tailwinds that will make them rally. Look at what happened when the Pfizer vaccine was announced with the massive rotation out of tech stocks. I expect similar moves, sooner rather than later. Biden is doing a decent job with vaccine roll out.

I believe that $5 is the new bottom of the share and I think we will be seeing a lot of weekly pops with small pullbacks, basically higher highs and higher lows, going forward. If you actively manage your position you may be able to exit at the high points and reenter at the pullbacks for additional profit.

&#x200B;

I don't see any negatives aside from COVID resurging for some reason. I do believe that the very worst is past for the theatre business.

&#x200B;

**Finally, let me address some common comments:**

\- I got Netflix, why would I go to the movies?

You've had netflix for years, yet you (and everyone else) still goes to the movies. The movies are not gonna die anytime soon. Worst case they won't grow and stagnate, but they are here for years to come.

&#x200B;

\- The studios will just offer their movies to streaming and not to theatres.

Absolute bullshit. Theatres are doing the opposite, pulling out catalogs from netflix. They are in a conundrum as they don't really know what to do. They don't want their movies streaming (because it's far, FAAAAAR less revenue for them) through 3rd parties but at the same time cannot create their own platforms to stream. The latter is just stupid. The CAPEX required to build your own platform is high, and the benefit is trivial since they can play movies in theatres and keep the majority of the ticket price. Besides, streaming movies only works for low budget films. Any blockbuster requires the cinematic experience. Very few people have top-model TVs at home with surround sound, and even if they do, 4K streamed over the internet results to sub-par quality. It just does not compare to the cinema quality. The only realistic alternative to cinema for home entertainment is having a top of the line tv+sound+bluray. But that's not streaming is it?

If streaming was to kill off theatres then VHS, DVD and Bluray would have done so before (Studios would have released straight to DVD, why didn't they?). It never happened and for good reason. People go to the movies because of a) The cinematic experience, b) they combine it with a night out, c) it's a way of socializing and much more. That won't go away. Btw, Disney, despite having a streaming platform decided to go ahead with theatrical releases of all its movies in 2021, and won't offer them on streaming at the same time. Get it now?

Another reason why that won't work = Look at Disney, they offered Mulan through their own platform, so what best example to examine. They did not offer it as part of the subscription, so forget about paying your monthly neftlix and having new movies for free. They instead priced it at about 2x movie tickets. Even if they are to continue that with their next releases it's not really that much more affordable compared to going to the movies, is it? So don't expect Universal or 20th Century offering you all their new movies for $10/month. Ain't gonna happen.

&#x200B;

\- Theatres have been open since August but noone is going

Noone is going not only because of COVID concerns, but there are no movies to see. You need studios to release their movies for people to return. I don't expect them to do so until restrictions are lifted and everyone can safely return to the theatres.

&#x200B;

\- So, what else besides James Bond is coming in 2021? why would I go to the cinema for just 1 movie.

You are an idiot. Here is a list of upcoming blockbuster releases: [https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/](https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/)

Look at summer time onwards, there is a hot movie almost every week. Most of the movies in the first half will likely be released in the second half after all, making it a bonanza of new films coming out in summer onwards.

&#x200B;

\- Theatres are dead in the long term, aren't they?

We are all dead in the long term. I don't care. Let's focus in the next six months ok? My investment horizon for AMC is up to the end of 2021 the latest. In a best case scenario I expect the recovery to be fully priced in by summer time when I will exit or just start selling CCs again. I may exit/renter several times to what I think may be short-term peaks and troughs. I'm not Buffett so I'm not buying for life. I'm in this for the rally to normalcy.

&#x200B;

\###I may edit this post at the bottom to address any recurring comments.

\###I'm also planning on buying some calls if IV goes down a bit

\###I won't be doing another AMC DD for a few days at least, maybe after 2/25 when ER happens.

**3. Apart from these indirect metrics, PLUG fundamental metrics are also growing:**

\- Plug Power has been steadily increasing its profits over the past years starting from 2013. The last quarter was a record revenue of $107M

\- In January, Plug signed a contract with Renault to create a joint venture.

\- The company Plug Power itself develops hydrogen fuel cell systems and works in the field of alternative energy, which on its own is quite innovative and lays the ground for further growth of the stock price.

\- **The new administration announced a return to the Paris Climate Accord, which means the inevitable growth of the Alternative Energy market and companies like Plug Power**.

Brief overview of why I like it.

&#x200B;

* Kratos has landed a bevy of recent contract wins and appears to be punching above its weight-class as compared to larger defense and aerospace companies.
* The company has a strong balance sheet and a strong backlog with a Q3 ending book-to-bill ratio of 1.8x.
* With a market cap of only $4 billion - and combined with leading edge drone and satellite communications technology - the company looks to be a ripe M&A target.
* Meantime, ARK Invest has been loading up on the stock and Kratos will likely be a core holding in the upcoming ARK Invest Space ETF.

These bullets are from a recent SA article, you can look it up for additional details.

Lots of words below, so here’s the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir’s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/fuvi00aejph61.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a…

# Big.

# Fucking.

# Deal.

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they’re in, I’m in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I’ll self dox myself. I’m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username).

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I’m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don’t kink shame. [Here’s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany & Co., and the FTC.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a Keyser Söze position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I’m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow.

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#1) Praise & Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0p7dwzijph61.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it’s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software.

Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce.

**Migration from ‘*****Find the Terrorist*****’ to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions.

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war,’ and I think that is spot on. That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I’ll keep it short. It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

https://preview.redd.it/hl1j7wwkjph61.jpg?width=1314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4dc190a30dc75e8d66bcd6c8ab74cb42472137d

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I’d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I’ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals

I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

>*· I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
>  
>*· It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
>  
>*· I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
>  
>*· I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‘*killed it*,’ you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir’s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/77xps5ipjph61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb3acbee813e27ca69f7b94c9158fba44c6e142a)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‘decision’ and ‘decision makers.’

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it.

But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft’s market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn’t make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That’s absolutely bonkers and that’s why this is no surprise:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ns8wcvvsjph61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fb13831b6f18b58f53fa5131f6543e950e8569f

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

>*\[minor edits for brevity\]*  
>  
>*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal & external) to ensure they’re airworthy when we need them. Since we don’t know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  
>  
>*Our optimization models consider when “big events” (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*  
>  
>*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives – do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*

&#x200B;

**#4) Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines.

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can’t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets.

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mvmtqwdvjph61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef22d9c598c63b3bd4e488b8439bc4082ff9f5ba

\_\_\_\_\_

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can’t scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce).

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir – PG&E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization.
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I’m not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock.

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don’t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right.

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right.

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes.

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you’re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts– whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you.

Enjoy your tendies, you’ve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I’m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it’s own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla.

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I’m not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I’m skeptical that I’ll sell any more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That’s my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news.

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang!

* Tesla has a market cap of $800 Billion. Fannie Mae has a **market cap of $2 Billion**.

   * There are also UNSEALED documents showing the mafia-style bailout, which is evidence in the SCOTUS case.
* I think most people don't know about the 12/9/2020 SCOTUS case questioning a bid by shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pursue legal claims arising from the government’s rescue of the mortgage finance firms following the 2008 housing crisis. Yes, the case went to the supreme court! **Less than 100 days until SCOTUS decision.**
   * If we are lucky, then the ruling will come out before June 9, 2021.
      * The ""June"" date is set as the end-date of the summer adjournment; they should, probably will, clear their slate and pronounce before heading out.
      * Seems like April 1st is a middle-ground - they will of course be hearing cases in Feb, Mar, April, etc and those would get cleared out, as well.
      * Bottom line: Shorts do not have until June to play games. Longs can't be on the sidelines thinking nothing-happening until then either. **It could happen literally any day now.** 🚀🚀
      * Here is a [good summary of the SCOTUS arguments for the Collins vs Mnuchin case](https://www.lawfareblog.com/supreme-court-hears-oral-argument-collins-v-mnuchin)
* Fannie has a P/E and it’s less than 1. The company’s fourth quarter 2020 earnings were $4.6 billion, or $18.40 billion annualized. As of December 31, 2020, Fannie had 1.158 billion shares of common stock outstanding, but Treasury also holds warrants for another 4.6 billion shares, resulting in 5.76 billion fully diluted shares outstanding. Fannie’s fourth quarter earnings per share (annualized) thus are $3.19, which at today’s common stock price at this moment of $1.92 makes for a for a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 0.60...

Lots of words below, so here’s the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir’s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/opd8qiutdph61.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4bf46f2978e194792814abf31e84c3e19fa6632)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a… 

# Big. 

# Fucking. 

# Deal. 

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I’ll self dox myself. I’m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username). 

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I’m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don’t kink shame. [Here’s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany & Co., and the FTC.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a [Keyser Söze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5k73jx2mIc) position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I’m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow. 

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

**#1) Praise & Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lpzxhuse5ph61.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e677cb560749bb8cbeeee1a64d4ac2a731ced48

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it’s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software. 

Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce. 

**Migration from ‘*****Find the Terrorist*****’ to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions. 

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war,’ and I think that is spot on. That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force 

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I’ll keep it short. It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

[Palantir is the IL-ist SaaS on the market](https://preview.redd.it/eo8dcuir5ph61.jpg?width=1314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b2c02e0131256508c34eeb0c2cdaeb26bc2a2eb)

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I’d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I’ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon 
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals 

I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

>*· I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
>  
>*· It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
>  
>*· I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
>  
>*· I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‘*killed it*,’ you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir’s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

&#x200B;

[Iron Man. Cerebral Edition.](https://preview.redd.it/krrhl2b18ph61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9cd28bdbdab1e372fddb9a91002774fe44c0f900)

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‘decision’ and ‘decision makers.’

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it. 

But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft’s market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn’t make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That’s absolutely bonkers and that’s why this is no surprise:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u5tuxd3v7ph61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a7e0dc34fc3b59e2e308b1e2440c7b6d28a02bc3

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

>*\[minor edits for brevity\]*  
>  
>*The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal & external) to ensure they’re airworthy when we need them. Since we don’t know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between.*  
>  
>*Our optimization models consider when “big events” (airframe checks, engine overhauls, and landing gear overhauls) will be due, along with the cost of those events and the available maintenance capacity to complete them. The models also incorporate other factors: parts availability and cost, available technician hours at each maintenance station, ability to secure supplemental maintenance lines at external MRO providers, aircraft-specific mechanical reliability and on-time performance, and even the quality of the in-flight products (seats, Wi-Fi, entertainment, power outlets).*   
>  
>*The team is also helping optimize the cycling of active and parked aircraft whenever we have surplus planes available to fly, which ensures regulatory compliance with the maintenance program, minimizes operating costs, and enables our Tech Ops team to be very intentional about balancing our operational objectives – do we want to fly the most reliable aircraft, the lowest cost aircraft, or the aircraft with the most time left until its next major maintenance event?*

**#4) Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines. 

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can’t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets. 

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nyytsh2t7ph61.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3add6e4cce72860f13b66048defdc0ba715c77ae

\_\_\_\_\_

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can’t scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce). 

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir – PG&E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization. 
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I’m not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock. 

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don’t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right. 

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right. 

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes. 

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you’re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts– whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you. 

Enjoy your tendies, you’ve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I’m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it’s own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla. 

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I’m not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I’m skeptical that I’ll sell very many shares this more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That’s my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news. 

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at [the restaurant at the end of the universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Ig3X59_qA) PLTR gang!

Let me introduce y’all retards to the wonderful world of commodities. 2021 is going to be a year like no other, we can expect this year for commodities to grow in value leading up to harvest in the fall rather then drop like they have in years past.

Why?

\-Corn prices ended in 2020 in a 6yr high of $4.80/bushel…+60% from august  of 2020

\-High demand for corn is coming from China due to their recent Hog population making a recovery from a swine flu.

\-Second to Ethanol, China is the leading factor for corn growth in the USA… soon to be the main reason.

\-China is estimated to import 16.5million mt of corn in 2021 compared to 7.6million mt in 2020. Also, important to note that in 2020 China only committed to 60,000mt of corn and ended up importing 7.6million mt. For 2021 CHINA HAS ALREADY COMMITED TO 11.6MILLION MT OF CORN. Yes, that’s right, they have already **committed** to import more corn than their total importation in 2020. Also keep in mind, thats just their commitment, the final amount will be <11.6 million mt of corn

\-US corn production estimates have also fallen \~9% from September to August (2020), not to mention year end corn stock estimated have fallen to a 7 year low of 43.23 million mt of corn.

\-Shrinking supplies of corn in the US, EU, Argentina and Ukraine will mean that corn prices will stay stable AT LEAST. Argentina and Ukraine have actually already suspended corn exports until March 2021… further boosting the price of corn.

\-The two main crops in the USA are soybeans and corn, analysts are predicting that more soybeans will be planted this year acre x acre compared to corn… further increasing the demand and price.

\-Last but not least, as I mentioned earlier the main biproduct of corn is ethanol, \~40% of corn production to be exact. With decreasing lockdowns and more vaccines getting distributed, more and more people will be active outdoors further increasing ethanol demand and usage. It is also important to note that one of the biproducts of ethanol production is DDGS, which are also shipped overseas to countries that cannot grow the proper feed for their cattle/hogs. DDGS are mixed in with the little food that these Asian countries grow so that proper nutrition can be met for their livestock.

84,"Some background on $HIMS, a branded telehealth company offering 🍆 pills, and why I'm super bullish",256,0.8,Frostayyyyy,"I hate nothing more than the market being closed on a Monday so here's some solid DD to outlet my frustration:

$HIMS is a branded telehealth company focusing on personal care products for both men and women. It originally started as a provider of pills for your balding head or limping noodle cock but has expanded into offerings for dermatology, mental health psychiatric's and women's care products as well. Basically, millennials and Gen Z don't like talking to their doctor and would rather order personal care products via online consultation to avoid awkward subjects, ie. balding and limp dick. The reason we give as shit is that Oaktree Capital, led by the famed investor Howard Marks, recently led a SPAC to merge with $HIMS and the ticker changed over just a few weeks ago. Peter Thiel and Alex Rodriguez also happen to be early investors. Has anyone seen the JLo ads? Cathie also couldn't resist and piled some shares into her ARK genomics ETF just recently. Smart people have clearly done the deep dive on this and left hungry to invest. 

I had to do my own DD of course so I tried getting prescribed ED pills via Hims. Now I'm a healthy college student but no one can turn down some recreational dick inflation. I was surprised by how seamless and fast the experience on its interface was, and the pills worked just as advertised. If every guy can do this, I can't see why Hims can't grow into a $20 billion market cap on this alone. Its financials have been nothing less than impressive with 91% YoY revenue growth and 71% gross margin, in line with what an attractive Saas company would typically have. It also has a substantially growing subscription base at 250,000, with average purchase amounts steadily rising. Telehealth is obviously a sector about to undergo massive growth in the U.S, with $TDOC and $AMWL leading in this space and providing the infrastructure to connect with your personal primary care provider. $HIMS is differentiated by its branded offerings, aggressive advertising and high-margin product categories which are direct to consumer, without insurance middlemen for now. Expanding into diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea and primary care product categories will supercharge this investment thesis. At $22, it's a few dollars down from a recent high a $25 but the real catalyst is earnings being announced on 3/18. All indications point towards a blowout earnings past management's typically conservative guidance. I'm long 15k in shares, 10k in $25 3/19 calls and 10k in $25 in 5/21 calls. I attached its investor presentation below which and the CEO just interviewed with the NYSE a few days ago. This is a no brainer imo.

85,Cannabis Stocks are Going BONGkers Ultimate DD,495,0.75,Braj728,"LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT TO INVEST IN CANNABIS (Shorting and hype aren't reasons)

In recent weeks, multiple factors have made pot stocks all the buzz. To begin with, Democrats taking control of Congress and the Oval Office could bring about real federal cannabis reforms. During the previous administration, Republican Mitch McConnell repeatedly kept cannabis legislation from reaching the Senate floor as Senate Majority Leader. Now, as Senate Minority Leader, McConnell no longer holds the same power. New Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has been clear that he intends to co-draft legislation to legalize marijuana in the U.S. 🇺🇸

Gallup's national sentiment poll on cannabis showed that an all time record of 68% of people in 2020 favored the idea of legalization. More specifically, 83% of self-identified Democrats want to wave the green flag on marijuana

I wouldn't focus on Aurora, Tilray-Aphira, Canopy, and definitely NOT Sundial. These stocks WILL NOT make you rich.

My Ultimate 2 Picks in the Industry:

VILLAGE FARMS:  In November, Village Farms took full control of cannabis grower Pure Sunfarms, which it had established as joint venture with Emerald Health Therapeutics. Village Farms announced that it had fully repaid that debt, with accrued interest, putting the transaction to rest well ahead of schedule.  

In addition, Village Farms announced that it had increased its investment in Altum International, an Asian cannabinoid company, from around 6.6% to roughly 10%. This move will expand Village Farms' reach internationally, and it has the right to increase its stake in Altum further in the future. Helping to fund both of these deals was a $135 million equity sale it conducted in late January. 

Village Farms is positioned as a high-tech, low-cost, vertically integrated company focused on agricultural consumers and is actively seeking high-growth opportunities in emerging legal cannabis and related markets in the United States, Canada, and Australia.

The company’s Texas site is ready for hemp production when it receives a green light from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In Canada, it aims to increase the number of stores in Ontario from 300 to 1,000 next year. The company also has a presence in Europe — last year it became one of six equal shareholders in a Netherlands-based cannabis company.



GREEN THUMB:

If you want to own Cannabis winners, Sundial Growers should be just about the last name you should buy. Instead, focus on successful U.S. multistate operators that are on the cusp of recurring profitability.

It currently has 52 operating dispensaries in legalized states, with the ability to open as many as 96 retail locations in a dozen states.  What stands out is the company's focus on states like Illinois, Nevada, and New Jersey -- the latter of which legalized recreational pot in the November election. Illinois, for instance, is a limited license state (i.e., only a set number of retail locations will be allowed). With the Land of Lincoln reaching $1 billion in weed sales in its first year following the legalization of adult-use pot, Green Thumb stands a good chance of securing significant share in this budding market.

Another reason Green Thumb is so successful is its inorganic growth. In June 2019, Green Thumb closed on its acquisition of Integral Associates, giving the company access to more than a half-dozen retail locations in Nevada, including the sole location on the Las Vegas Strip. 

Lastly, Green Thumb generates 70% of its revenue from derivatives (e.g., edibles, beverages, vapes, topicals, and concentrates). Derivatives offer substantially higher margins than dried cannabis flower, which is a big reason Green Thumb is turning the corner to profitability before many of its peers.

FUTU holdings is the ""Robin hood"" of China blah blah blah.. whatever.

Listen here. Robin hoods, IG holdings, Webull, all these dudes actually have crazy net profit margins (averaging 40% NET PROFIT MARGIN). I worked in a CFD broker for a while and I saw how they do it...

This is their magic 'SAUCE' - they offer you leverage. Then you Mr Autistic fuck head who just saw a post on WSB goes ahead and uses LEVERAGE to buy $1,000 worth of the stock with your measly 100$ equity account.

You only have 100$ in your account but you can leverage that shit *easily* with 1:10 leverage.

**Guess what-** you also pay 10 Times the fucking spread on the stock, or commission. THERE IS ALWAYS A PRICE.

Okay, if you've read this far I can explain to you how this relates to FUTU holdings.

40% net profit margin is the NORM in this industry, and they have just broken through to economies of scale

FUTU holdings has a LOW P/E of 180. That's low because they literally DOUBLED their net profit last quarter. What happens to a company with a P/E of 180 when net income doubles autists? P/E goes to 90 - *in one quarter.*

They have 10 million active users on their platform, China's population around 1.4Bn. They have ATLEAST a 100 million market in terms of people who will sign up and lose all their money on their app.

Their user growth and their paid user growth hasn't been slowing, it's been accelerating.

Like you have to be fucking retarded not to buy this fucking stock.

Biggest risk - China will probably regulate this business when they realise how damaging 'gambling on the stock market' actually is. Till then, it's a rocket to fucking 100 or 200BN USD

I don't think many understood this aspect:

&#x200B;

**P/E 180**, is obviously super high, *but*\*\*\*,\*\*\* this company is seeing increases in net profit of over 100% in ONE QUARTER. That means over 1 full year P/E ratio could easily fall drastically.

&#x200B;

For a company seeing growth as high as this, a PE of 180 is super misleading and makes chodes and normies alike say 'overvalued'. If the price doesn't move from here, and growth keeps going at the same pace (there shouldn't be anything stopping it, only regulation). Then next year price to earnings could be around 20-30 (STILL with significant growth prospects).

Okay folks, weebs, simps and autists.

Some of the comments said to take a look at TIGR. I've modelled their statements. They are *just about* to hit the 40% economies of scale net profit margin. Their 2020 Year looked like FUTU's 2019 year in terms of margins.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now, I am currently doing some more due diligence into this company...Mainly, we need to find out if the company allows people to easily deposit from Chinese Mainlanders.

FUTU, as the comments have said, make it difficult for mainland customers to deposit money. They first need to open up a bank account in Hong Kong. Is TIGR's process any different? I will find out and update.

87,DD for Checkpoint (CHKP),30,0.68,CadperGN,"**Preamble**

Comming from a technology background I clearly have a better edge when looking into these types of companies opposed to other sectors.

Checkpoint is first a Security company with a productline of firewalls and other network related software/hardware configurations such as IDS, IPS, Gateways and more. Checkpoint also runs a highly skilled security research team that, just by looking at last year had the awesome finding of SigRed that could have been a very potent vulnerability.

Checkpoint is located in Israel but traded on Nasdaq.

**Disclaimer**

I bought 26 shares for an avarage price of 120,48 on friday.

**Financials**

Checkpoint is  running as a profitable business trading at P/E of 20,26 and EPS at 5,96.

Checkpoint has had YoY growth in revenue for the past 3 years (not looking further back), no large outstanding debt to be paid and a free cashflow that covers just about a years worth of expeses for financing activities.

They've beaten EPS the last 4 quarters whereas the latest came in at 2.17 with expected 2.11.

**Price range**

As the Q4 earnings came out there has been an increase in shorting of the stock which was reported at \~8% of float on the 29th reporting. This can also be observed in the price chart:

*Why short?*

I have absolutely no idea. It's a healthy company with good financials, a great prospect for future growth given their position in the market. While the network product line continues to dominate (at least from my industry perspective) their research team is of the highest standard and they've continued to grow their product line in other areas such as threat prevention and cloud security.

*Positives:*

* Good position in the market
* Good financials
* Good productline
* Good access to skilled resources (being in Israel and their heavy investment in Cyber Security)

*Negatives:*

* Highly competitive market
* Short positions seem to increase (theoretical SI could be at 11,48%)
* Short term estimate from CHKP is below what the market hoped
* Downward trend when looking at SMA30+SMA50 (see below)

Market cap is smallish roughly 40bil.

Means even if they double they are still tiny compared to Tesla! Even if the 10x they are half the size of Tesla. This means room to grow 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Everyone knows “Ford” there’s rumors a merger with Tesla but I don’t think it would ever happen the brand “Ford” is like Disney to famous be acquired but it’s a possibility because Ford has the factories and can pump out tons of cars FAST something Tesla struggles with.

They are doubling down on EV now! Mache-e has the WOW factor which = free advertising for them via social media. Beats out Tesla in almost all the reviews. Seriously go google Mache-e.

The new Branco also has the wow factor! Legacy company and brands which = consumer loyalty. Has factories in place already ready to ramp up EV FAST!🚀🚀🚀🚀

F-150 going electric in a few years this is THE truck there really isn’t any other truck out there because Ford is undeniably the best truck maker in the world.

Vehicles cheaper because of EV government credits which Tesla doesn’t get anymore.🚀🚀🚀🚀

New CEO! Who reshaping and got the business back on track! Auto sales are up significantly and they closed under performing regions.

You need more reasons to buy and hold stocks here? Car discounts for share holders!!! [Discount - Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/leWoGTB) you need 100 shares and hold them for 6 months min

""Yup, Ford has all that, plus:

* A 500 billion dollar investment and partial ownership of Rivian, a member of the Ford family on Rivian's board of trustees, and a partnership with Rivian to be able to use Rivian's skateboard (R1T, R1S) platform.
* 1 billion dollars investment and majority ownership in Argo AI which received a multi billion dollar investment from VW early last year. Argo AI is the team putting together Ford's autonomous vehicle. They must have been doing something right for VW to invest billions in them.
* Partnership with VW that allows Ford to use VW's MEB platform (ID3, ID4).
* 7.6% stake in Velodyne, a LIDAR company. How many autonomous vehicles do you see without LIDAR? No, not even the Tesla's with the ""full self driving beta"" are fully autonomous.
* Owns SPIN, the scooter company.
* Massive ICE F-150 profits instead of Tesla shareholders and tax credits to fund their EV and autonomous plans.

89,"Comparing Market Volume Patterns for Stocks from WSB Sectors WeedGang, DiamondHands, and VintageTech: Predictions for Tuesday",188,0.86,President_Wolfe,"This post presents several market volumes for multiple stocks with daily price changes in an attempt to explain a possible method to identify future dips in share price.

Since the last time, I automated a TON of the process I used in my [last post to predict dips with market volume patterns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li5vch/i_think_i_found_a_way_to_predict_dips_with_nasdaq/) to where now I can search across stocks WAY FASTER for market volumes starting to sync and rise up. **For those curious, READ the old DD post,** and linked to a public version there for those wanting to recreate the figures.

**NOTE:** *Jan 26th data is shit* for NASAQ BX, it shows some stocks having MORE short volume then there was total volume, and FINRA actually removed their 26th data and replaced it recently, so that date in the plots should be ignored.

**Understanding the Legend:**

* **F** is data from FINRA Daily Volume files
* **NP** is data from NASDAQ PSX market's daily volume files.
* **NB** is data from NASDAQ BX market's daily volume files.
* **ShXVo**l is the short exempt volume for the day from FINRA
* **ShVol** is the short volume for the day from the respective market
* **MaxShXVol** is the largest value short exempt daily volume from FINRA for all the data shown
* **MaxSVol** is the largest value from the short volume data from respective market
* **TotVol** is the day's total volume from the respective market
* **DayChange** is the ( day's closing price minus the opening price ) divided by the opening price
* **PreOpenActivity** is the (previous day's close - day's open)/ previous day's close

[Figure 0: Plots for TSLA markets, top and bottom show similar values that differ by normalization. ](https://preview.redd.it/z2rixi5hyjh61.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=d45ef261fcc2a2593fd10a4e9bd3fb51bf5519f3)

**Overview of the Method Using TSLA:**

* Identify which days TSLA fell the most:
   * Jan 11th, Jan 15th, Jan 29th, and Feb 10th TSLA fell 4-5%
* Look for patterns and trends in available data around those days:
   * NASDAQ BX(BLUE) and PSX(RED) short volumes go higher around those days
   * Jan 8th, Friday before Monday's Jan 11th dip, showed blue and red syncing up and climbing.
   * Jan 14th showed similar behaviour, but peaked much lower
   * Jan 27th and 28th had red and blue both rising steadily before Jan 29th dip
   * Feb9th, going into Feb 10th, has a HUGE sharp spike in both red and blue. This one seemed VERY sudden and probably could not be used.
* **Generalize Findings:**
   * Different market's short volumes sometime start to move in a similar way before significant dips in price.

**Summary:**

* ***By watching for similar behavior across different markets, a possible dip can sometimes be identified  the previous trading day, and possibly two days prior.***

&#x200B;

Hopefully the above explained to you the general method that I used in the previous post to predict the drop in the one stock. HOWEVER, I have not tried this with any other stocks, and I have not claimed that this will predict every dip. Rather, this only appears to predict significant dips in the price, where significant is relative to the dataset.

**So how does it work?**

* Usually the different markets appear to be independent of each other, some high, some low, trending up or down, doing their own thing... MOST of the time.
* From what I've seen, when the markets do appear to sync and act in a similar method, regarding their short volumes rising together, the share price dips.
* The volumes across the three different markets are VERY DIFFERENT, and unique for each stock. I've also only looked at data from NASDAQ based exchanges, even though some stocks are listed on the NYSE, some volume is still done via these markets.

&#x200B;

***My thoughts to explain all this:***

*When different markets all start to think the price is TOO HIGH, and start to short the stock, this general consensus across the markets becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and the price dips.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So without further ado, here are the plots that were asked for by popular demand!

# 1.) Diamond Hands Sector: AMC and GME

https://preview.redd.it/742aciqkyjh61.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf7782b899b15ad9a9113accc4a404648e053ab6

General Comments: Volumes have calmed down SIGNIFICANTLY since the excitement in late January. Very similar patterns in GME and AMC, and appears that short volumes have decreased over the last two days:

**Prediction:** GME and AMC up a small amount Tuesday, but nothing exciting, maybe even neutral.

&#x200B;

# 2.) WEED GANG Sector: SNDL and TLRY

https://preview.redd.it/56yuvzhcyjh61.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=200b5f171f259c17ddaef98e1841ddf22067cdc1

https://preview.redd.it/rzmpr5edyjh61.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df6e5ff35440715c24f064c81a46d9552aa067c

Again we see very similar market volume behavior across two stocks. The recent trend in different short volumes and similar behavior regarding their slope, and large dips in price, could be compared to either Jan 6th, where it would fall Monday, or Feb 8th, where it would rise Monday.

**Prediction:** SNDL and TLRY struggle Tuesday, but ends up positive.

&#x200B;

# 3.) VINTAGE TECH Sector: NOK and BB

https://preview.redd.it/pw0az0h0zjh61.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bc53002f21f2250ebf3f63893cf5af6f42ebdb9

https://preview.redd.it/7o4ubhy0zjh61.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cf0dab1afc6633770651f127f9506346a604967

Yea, I couldn't think of a better name for these two, so ""Vintage"" it became. There volumes have also significantly cooled off since late January. Without some comparable swings in volumes can't really say anything, especially since the NOK has been flat for weeks even back in 2020.

**Prediction:** NOK and BB both just forget to set their morning alarms for Tuesday and sleep in.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

* Explained my method for how to look for upcoming dips.
* No signs of large, significant dips for Tuesday for any stocks shown above.
* Made half-assed predictions for Tuesday:
   * None of them dip significantly, weed sector **may** start recovery, and I buy discount Valentine's Day candy.

**EDIT: Premarket for Predictions (6:00am)**

* DiamondHands: GME +1.3%, AMC +16%!
* WeedGang: SNDL +8%, TLRY +3%
* VintageTech: NOK +2%, BB -1.6%

92,Repost of my oil play dd. Last chance before the train leaves the station.,379,0.8,dc_chilling17,"(This was posted back when oil was around $50/barrel or so. It is now $60+)

Big oil play

There is an oncoming supply crunch in oil that can’t be stopped. Oil companies are now trading at a fraction of their former valuations, despite oil beginning to accelerate. Oil will be $80+ by the summer and the super majors will run up 50%+. Options are dirt cheap and unlike the meme companies, these are legit companies that will hold their value in time for the autists to take some gains off the table.

Here is the DD:

Global oil production has been carried by the US for the last decade. However, much of that production increase was achieved via shale/tight oil plays. At our peak, the US was producing 13.1 million barrels per day. 

Due to the pandemic, we shut off a ton of rigs to curb production. This was fine except their is one big problem: legacy declines. Shale wells can decline up to 80-90% in a year, so you can imagine what happens when you pull 75% of your rigs off line. Worse, companies/countries all over the world have significantly reduced capex related to oil during the pandemic.

It’s very likely that US production falls to 8-9 million barrels per day by the late summer. In that case, global production would be somewhere in the 95 million barrel per day range if cranked to the max. 

Global consumption was 100 million barrels per day in 2019. Since economic activity is essentially oil, if the economy opens up in a big way, supply will fall woefully short.

Fast forward to this summer, where most of the adult population is vaccinated and savings rates are at all time highs due to all the stimulus/unemployment money in the system. Now imagine that covid deaths are near 0 and people aren’t even getting tested anymore because they got the vaccine. What likely happens? My bet is on a surge in activity akin the the roaring 20s.

The play: 

I’m personally buying LEAPS in the super majors. I have around 3000 January 2022 $35 BP calls. I also have hundreds of XOM $55 January 2023 calls. Also have RDS $50 calls for January of 2022.

There are other plays in the oil patch but the super majors are the safest bet imo.

TLDR: Oil is going to the moon due to a supply/demand imbalance. Oil majors are still 40% off their 2019 lows and are about to take off.

Also, this is not investment advice. I just like these stocks.

Here are a couple of my positions: [XOM](https://snipboard.io/mhGHV8.jpg) and [BP](https://snipboard.io/RZKCs4.jpg).",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lk1pdl/repost_of_my_oil_play_dd_last_chance_before_the/,1613378867.0
93,AMC Blockbuster DD,1301,0.89,ImFedUpWithItAll,"&#x200B;

Disclaimer: None of the following is investment advice. Do your own research.

There's a lot of chatter about AMC and whether it'll pop or it'll dive. This is an attempt to establish the facts and figure out what's the roadmap to tendies from here on.

**tl;dr for those on a multicoloured crayon diet:**

**AMC is not dead, nor will it die anytime soon. There's plenty of positive catalysts coming up.**

**If you want to get in this play right away then better buy shares because IV is very high at the moment. $5 seems like a price floor. If you do want to buy calls I suggest Aug expiry between $7-$9, or better yet LEAPS Jan 22 at $10-$12.**

**My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40. I'm waiting for IV to drop a bit before I buy LEAPS.**

Let's start at the beginning:

AMC is the largest movies operator in the world. It has 1,004 theatres and 11,041 screens worldwide. The biggest, by far. They made $43bn revenue for movie studios in 2019.

What we know from the Q3 2020 results:

After 5 months suspension of Operations theatres started to reopen.

First domestic theatres reopened 8/20 and int'l ones as early as June. However, most of Europe has been in lockdown since Nov/Dec 2020 and all domestics operate on a 20%-40% limited capacity. As of Oct 30th it operated 539/600 domestic locations and 261/358 int'l locations.

Record high scores in cleanliness of theatres.

March 2020 raised $900m in debt and equity. $1bn concessions from creditors and landlords, $80m asset sales.

* Q1 of 2020: drew down $325m from existing credit lines
* April 2020: issued $500m of debt due 2025. Suspended cash repurchase and dividends. Received $7m in tax cash refunds
* July 2020: debt exchange reduced debt by $555m, reduced interest expenses by $120m for one year (up to July 2022), extended maturities on $1.7bn of debt until 2026 and issued $300m of new debt due 2026.
* August 2020: sold Baltic region theatres for $77m.
* Sept 2020: sold 15m shares for $56.1m.
* Oct 2020: sold another 15m shares for $41.6m.
* Dec 2020: Prepared 50m shares for issuance, should they need to. Total shares outstanding on Dec 28 2020 were 164m Class A and 51.8m Class B.
* Jan 2021: Total shares outstanding as of Jan 22 2021 were 287,276,58 Class A and 51.8m Class B (Class B can't be sold unless converted to Class A).
* Jan 27th: SLA converts debt into equity and sells $600m worth of shares in the market. Total shares added to float: 44.4m. Debt reduced by $600m
* Feb 5th 2020: Wanda converted it's class B shares to class A shares. This means they can sell them in the market at any time now. There is no specific # on how many shares it converted, but we know it owned 51.8m of Class B shares.

Operationally they proceeded with layoffs and a series of cost cutting measures, renegotiated theatre leases, eliminate contractor roles and all sorts of expenses. **This is important as these savings will persist throughout the reopening of the theatres, so they will improve their profit margins going forward.**

**Cash position on 9/30: $417.9m**

**Total debt on 9/30: $5.82bn**

**Q&A with myself**

**Are people really returning to theatres?**

Attendance was 6.5m tickets in Q3 2020 vs 87.1m in Q3 2019, representing about 7.5% of seating capacity, which was limited to about 20%-40% of total seats. While this may look like they are not utilizing their existing seating capacity, remember that theatre ops in USA were suspended for 2/3 of the 3rd quarter. I am guessing (no data) a similar restriction at the international theatres. Had ops not been suspended for 2/3 of Q3 then we'd be seeing roughly 3x the tickets, about 19.5m, or 22% of total seating capacity. That would suggest people were returning to cinemas before the end of Sept 2020. That's despite no blockbusters playing. **Only 2 films were released theatrically since mid-March to end of Sept and theatres were open mostly on weekends, so there wasn't much to watch anyway.**

**Are people spending at the theatres?**

Average ticket prices in Q3 2020 were $9.37 VS. $9.45 in Q3 2019, so pretty much the same.

In Int'l markets ticket prices were actually higher, at $9.80 vs $8.45.

Spending on food and beverage was the same in USA, at $5.35/patron in both Q3 2020 and Q3 2019, and higher in int'l markets ($4.10/patron vs. $3.59/patron in Q3 2019)

Again, that's positive in relation to how customers feel about AMC managing the cleaning of its theatres and safety practices. That level of spending suggests people are comfortable watching movies and eating/drinking in the theatres.

**From the Q3 ER call:**

The critical movie-leading markets of Los Angeles and New York City remain closed.

There has been massive focus on improving liquidity and deleveraging the balance sheet and cutting costs and spending. **A lot of those cost saving and spending cuts will continue even after revenue recovers,** which means higher profit margins, which means higher EPS, which means lower multiples to comps, which means share price will go up as it will be perceived as 'cheap'.

Stroke a deal with Universal for a PVOD window. Basically, that means that AMC will not exclusive rights to play movies for 74 days at theatres before the movie can go on video-on-demand. The time window is shortened, and after that you will have movies both on theatres and on demand online at the same time. AMC will take a cut for any movies that go on PVOD before the theatrical release period ends. As they said later in November, they have made more money with the PVOD deal than the standard exclusive theatrical release.

Theatre count in Middle East tripled in 2020, and it will further double in the first half of 2021.

Cash burn for Q3 2020 was $324m, inclusive of the costs for raising capital.

**44 major film titles have been rescheduled to play theatrically only in 2021. Once theatres reopen, say in summer, there will be a blockbuster every single week and some more.**

They have gotten out of 40 loss-making theatres in USA as well by not renewing leases.

**Breaking even?**

In 2019 AMC sold 17% of their available seats and had the biggest revenue/profit of any year ever. It all hinges to NYC and LA reopening basically as other individual theatres break even at 25% capacity. What this means is that you don't need COVID restrictions to lift fully before AMC starts making profits, you only need LA and NYC to reopen. This makes AMC a bit of a dark horse because most people will be waiting for full economy reopen before they jump at the stock, but its financials will be in the black long before then, and that means that it will most likely surprise upwards on ER going forward and exceed wallstreet's expectations.

**Innovation. Ok, they will reopen, but will they grow?**

They have launched a private theatre rental program, where you can book the whole auditorium. They have had 80,000 incquiries about it, and that's with a soft launch (no press releases yet or advertising).

There have been a lot of articles in the second half of 2020 about Amazon or Netflix partnering or buying them out. That would drive the price high instantly. Bear in mind that the streaming giants are facing pressure on growing their market share and AMC makes perfect sense. Also, given their balance sheets the financial risk of buying AMC out at roughly $2bn market cap is negligible.

**Won't streaming kill the movie theatres?**

No, absolutely not. AMC provided $43bn of revenue to film makers in 2019. No studio will forgo that kind of revenue. In fact, from the pilot testing of PVOD they've done, it's actually more lucrative for both theatres and studios to have a short exclusive theatrical release followed by concurrent streaming, than either/or. It's a new model of releasing movies and a much more profitable one. In summary, streaming will actually increase profits for AMC, not take away any.

**Ok, that may be true for the big blockbuster Avenger-type movies, but what about smaller releases? won't they be best stream-only?**

No, they have tested the PVOD deal with small releases (e.g. Kajilionaire which made under $10m revenue in cinemas) and the combined profit for studios/AMC was higher than the older model or what it'd have done streaming alone.

**Analyst ratings:**

According to marketbeat: 4 sell and 6 hold

AMC has the lowest, by far, P/E ratio against its competitors. This means it is perceived as cheap.

**Earnings date: 25 Feb**

&#x200B;

**Major shareholders:**

* Blackrock 2.9% (increased it's position by 70%)
* Vanguard 4.5% (reduced its position slightly by -5%)
* Mittleman 1%
* Norther Trust 0.5% (increased position by 40%)
* Stifel 0.2% (increase position by 285%)
* Bank of NY Mellon 0.2%
* Wells Fargo 0.15%
* Charles Schwab 1% (increased its position by 10%)
* Goldman Sachs 0.6% (increased position by 160%)

**Risks:**

Further dilution in case AMC decides to sell more shares. This can be avoided if theatres start reopening faster or attendance picks up. With vaccinations underway in USA we should soon hear about LA and NYC reopening (NYC already lifte some restrictions in hospitality). People are worried about dilution, but do remember that shareholders were happy to pay high prices for those shares, so they believe they bought in cheap, and they aren't all idiots.

Debt holders pushing hard on AMC. However, this is unlikely to their benefit as any restructuring will take forever and they stand to lose a lot through a prolonged asset sale. It's preferable for debt holders to convert debt to equity and sell - and for that they'd need a good/high stock price.

Further COVID lockdowns because of new variants or whatnot

&#x200B;

**Catalysts**:

Definite: Vaccination roll out means NYC and LA announce reopening of theatres soon.

Possible: Esports partnerships

Who knows: Buyout or partnership with Netflix, Amazon or Disney

**Other**

* Short interest remains high, I believe it was around 68% on 1/31, but someone may correct me if I got this wrong. In any positive newsflow the shorts will be pressed a bit.
* People are gagging to go to the cinema, AMC has had it's best revenue year after year up to 2019. They are not a dying business by any stretch of the imagination.

95,Banco Macro (BMA) - DD (SUPER LOW PE),21,0.61,Sidemen-Ultimate-Fan,"Some boring ass DD for you all. Afraid this stock doesn't have the high short interest we love so much but here we go. It's off to South America for this one!

Banco Macro is the second largest bank in Argentina. In 2020 it suffered the death of its CEO and suffered hard from the Covid-19 Pandemic so far appearing to have come out at around a breakeven point in terms of income (estimated P/E=0.01) for the year. The stock currently trades at $14.83 with a mkt cap of 1.615BN.

However, and here is why this stock really is a winner, here are the PE/forward PE ratios for 2019 and estimates for 2021 and 2022.

2019 = 1.36

2021 = 3.48

2022 = 2.02

An average of 2.75 for the two coming years. Far far below the industrial standard for banks of the low teens.

The average analyst 1 year price target for this stock is $22.80. Additionally, the reintroduction of a dividend would be a massive boost to the stock and would have a reasonable chance of being a high div yield. The vaccine offers a way out of the pandemic and a fast recovery for the bank.

For its last earnings Macro managed to keep non-performing loans at 1%, below the sector average of 4.5%. Its coverage ratio -- a gauge of liquidity -- held above 300%, far higher than the industry average of 126%.

My PTs:

Level 1 - $25

Level 2 - $50

This does not mean this stock is a definite. Argentina is suffering an inflation crisis and the full outcome of the pandemic is still to be seen. Additionally from a TA perspective, the current price sits near the top of the Bollinger band and has a number of resistances on the way up. It does have high calls activity for April at $17.50 which could be a good sign.

**Conclusion: High growth potential, a big move would almost definitely be a 50%-100% with room for far more in the PE ratios. Element of risk comes due to the financial situation in Argentina which should be weighed in. PSYCH risk is just a concept made up by financial institutions to stop us making millions.**

I plan on taking a small position (around 250 shares) on Monday and some calls.

96,INTC - Catalysts for a breakout of all time high and the road to Trillion dollar market cap 🚀🚀🚀,41,0.62,tecladovoador,"Hello again lazy slush brained degenerates. I'm putting rocket emojis just for you guys! I know you love them  **🚀**  **🚀**

&#x200B;

TLDR: There are a few short term catalysts that can propel this sleeper stock to the moon. Buy INTC on Tuesday, or wait till the end of the week and see if I am right and its at near 70$ and buy then. Or just wait till its already overvalued and spiked parabolically to enter as usual.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I expressed (but not nearly enough) how Intel is like a beautiful meal. You got an appetizer yesterday with Mobileye and today I planned on giving you a dessert focused on Intel's AI/machine learning/neural network play but ill leave that for another day like I will with the main dish (Data).

&#x200B;

Ill wait for the price to be more ripe (which it will in the coming weeks) to expose these valuable long term prospects for the legacy chipmaker. I think you will take my valuations more seriously when INTC is around 70$ per share.

&#x200B;

Today I want to look at possible catalysts for INTCs 2021 bull run.

&#x200B;

1.) The most obvious is one that is already partially in play, and also partially responsible for INTCs 24% YTD returns. The changing of leadership at Intel. As you might know this Monday (markets closed) Pat Gelsinger officially takes over as CEO of Intel. Catalyst 1.1 was his appointment, catalyst 1.2 is him stepping in officially as CEO and his first announcements. When he stepped in for the earnings call last month he mentioned he had many ideas and thoughts that he would share publicly when he was officially in the role and had a chance to look through things more carefully (which he has been doing lately). There is guaranteed to be interesting chatter in the grapevines this coming week. If you believe Pat is one of the good ones this chatter is bound to be positive. Ill leave your uncreative brains to think of the myriad possibilites of the things Pat can say in the first few days/weeks that can tremendously impact the market price and corporate perception.  **🚀**

&#x200B;

Small side note, the leadership change is not exclusive to Pat, there are several top silicon valley pros coming back at Pats request (some returning from retirement). INTC knows it has been hit and is rallying its troops. All hands on deck to get this shit rolling back to the top. These people don't fuck around and they bleed Intel.

&#x200B;

2.) Semiconductor shortage. As you may or may not know there is a relatively large chip shortage that is affecting many industries. GM for example had to shut down two of its plants recently, but this is not just affecting the auto industry, it is affecting dozens of different industries (some more than others). What does this mean for Intel? Well, Intel makes chips. They have the largest foundries in the world and there are at least a handful of ways a company like Intel can leverage this situation to their advantage.  **🚀**  **🚀**

&#x200B;

3.) This one is at least in part linked to the second point, but goes beyond that. Biden administration intervention in the US semiconductor industry. Last week the SIA (Semiconductor industry association sent a letter to President Biden calling for governmental support of the industry). Please read the one page letter, and your conclusion will be the same as mine. This rally call is exceptionally bullish for the industry. [https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf](https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf) It is especially bullish though for one of the signatories of the letter: Intel. Intel unlike AMD actually makes the chips and does not outsource the production to a foreign company (a Taiwanese company for that matter (risks associated with this I have discussed in another post)). Having an actual American fab is extremely big both short term and long term. This is a national asset and Intels future and well being is intertwined with Americas. Any Presidential administration will come to this conclusion. What does this mean? It is in the best interest of the United States for Intel to be bigger, richer and more dominant than TSMC and there are many ways American top brass can go about this.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**

&#x200B;

Expect tax breaks and subsidies soon (that will asymmetrically impact Intel positively). In fact, as part of Covid relief packages you can expect executive action pretty here pretty soon.

&#x200B;

4.) Look at the power of memes and momentum over the last year. The market has been permanently tainted and so the unexpected can happen. Intel is one of the few profitable tech companies that has not shot parabolically (yet) although from a technical standpoint its starting to hint at that this year. Soon people especially retail will want a play that hasn't already been exhausted, that can still give them strong returns. I mean is it really appetizing to buy TSLA or even AMD after they have multiplied so much? There is a cognitive bias for a pre parabolic company with potential, and in a parabolic industry (semis). This bias may not be super rational but if price action continues to side with INTC it will be part of the reinforcement process for the potential parabolic play. You get this stock to be memetic and it flies.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**

&#x200B;

5.) Strong market correction. As you know many smart and stupid analysts have been predicting a crash since last March. They have all turned out to be wrong (so far). Last week though several bearish indicators started reappearing (from bearish insider transaction numbers, yield on the 10 year, and the bizarre VIX action). To be clear I do not think the market will crash anytime soon and I'm quite bullish on all sectors for the coming months (so long as the fed and white house play along(and they have no reason to not until inflation actually passes 2% or something crazy happens with commodities including that coin that cant be named)).

&#x200B;

In any case in the event a crash happens INTC will be in a much better position than most. Speculation in the stock is low for now, large long term (boomer holders). The company has very little debt and is extremely cash rich. It can self fund all its operations for years and even lose revenues. Essentially Intel is an underleveraged company. AMD and NVIDIA for example are much more leveraged companies as is normal with rapidly growing tech companies. The reality is a market crash would damage the competition much more than it would INTC and it could even benefit Intel's market share.

&#x200B;

Further if the correction is not a full blown panic it is quite possible that Intel may actually appreciate in price as the majority of the nasdaq depreciates (again due to risk perception and lack of leverage) Intel can easily be seen as a safehaven.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**

&#x200B;

I get it, its not easy for you to part with your emotional investment in NVIDIA and AMD, besides they have treated you spectacularly especially the past year. You like their product and are angry at the fact INTC has been treating their retail customers poorly the last few years. You are sick of the machinations of the INTC leadership and their total focus on $$ losing track of the most important thing, product quality.

&#x200B;

Don't let the past cloud your judgment for future investment opportunities.

&#x200B;

You see Intel has its tentacles in everything that matters related to chips. They truly are Chipzilla as you will discover, in time.

&#x200B;

Come back to this post when Intel opens Tuesday up 2% and closes the week up 10% sniffing 70$ per share.

I reiterate my position:

1700 shares, 500 April 16 80$ strike calls, and 50 February 26 65$ strike calls.

97,Using options to play APHA/TLRY arbitrage,129,0.81,raptors902,"Using options to play APHA/TLRY arbitrage

For those of you who aren’t familiar with this situation I will outline a brief summary here. On Dec 16th, it was announced APHA would acquire TLRY through a reverse merger, with the new company trading under the TLRY name. Through this merger, each share of APHA will be converted to 0.8381 shares of the new TLRY ticker. However, there is currently a price dislocation in the market, as APHA closed Friday at 16.94 compared to 29.00 for TLRY. This represents a 30% discount from fair value on APHA.

The obvious trade to take advantage of this arbitrage opportunity is to put on a long/short pair trade. I’ve seen a few posts outlining this idea already. Basically, it would entail going long 1 share of APHA and short 0.8381 shares of TLRY. Theoretically this would capture the entire 30% dislocation as both companies trend towards their fair conversion ratio. There are, however, a few flaws/risks with this trade that should be considered. 

1. Borrow rates. In order to short TLRY you will need to pay interest to borrow the stock. This interest rate is quoted daily, and has fluctuated between 8-22% this past week (annualized). Assuming the holding period for this trade is 4 months - based on the merger occurring in Q2 - you would be paying 2.5-7.5% in interest at today’s rates. Now this doesn’t sound like a big deal because we’re capturing a 30% return right? Sure, assuming rates and share price remain at these levels. Now let’s assume TLRY continues to squeeze up to 100, now you’ve tripled your short position and need to pay triple the interest. Furthermore, the borrow rate will likely increase with price, and we’ve seen extreme borrow rates before, sometimes even in excess of 100% (GameStop topped 150% for a short period last summer). Very quickly you can see that interest rates have the potential to eat away at your returns.

2. Margin requirements. Along the same lines as my first point, if TLRY squeezes back up to ATHs your broker is going to require significant margin to hold your position. Remember, even though this is theoretically a delta neutral play with the impending merger, your broker won’t recognize your long APHA position as a hedge against your TLRY short. There could come a point where the margin balance required to hold the trade won’t justify the max profit potential.

Okay - so how do we play this then?

I’m suggesting a play that involves going long APHA shares and hedges with ITM TLRY puts. Specifically, let’s look at the June 100p. It would look something like this using Friday close numbers:

Long 100/0.8381 = 119.32 shares of APHA
Long 1 Jun 100p on TLRY

Premium on the puts is 75.525. 

If, at expiry TLRY trades at or below below 100, then the profit will be:

APHA
(P-16.94)*119.32*0.8381

TLRY
(100-P)*100 - 75.525*100

= 426.26

Essentially what we’re doing here is paying a slight premium on the put to lock in the short interest rate on TLRY and remove margin risk (we are essentially locking in the margin required for the trade - eliminating the risk of getting margin called if TLRY squeezes). 

Now the beauty of this trade is that you are now also delta positive. Assuming price dislocation does not increase, you are poised to capture another spike in APHA’s share price, profiting disproportionately on your long shares (because the delta of your TLRY put will trend down). Therefore there could be an opportunity to close the trade early for a profit - but if not you are secured by the fundamentals of the merger conversion ratio at expiry.


I believe using this strategy is at least lower risk than the long/short pair trade. This being said, there is still risk - and that is if for some reason the merger does not go through. This is unlikely, but possible. If this is the case, it is my speculative opinion that APHA will still outperform TLRY. My evidence for this that APHA traded at a higher per share value than TLRY pre-merger announcement in December. Upon announcing the deal, APHA sold off - indicating that the street saw the merger as an over pay for APHA. This assumption could be distorted by the political events that have ensued since that merger (it could be argued that the blue senate disproportionately benefits the American based TLRY compared to the Canadian based APHA). However, it is still my biased opinion that APHA is the better company absence of the merger.

TLDR:

Long 119.32 shares APHA
Long 1 Jun 100p TLRY

98,"Celebrate Chinese New Year with PUTS on $NIO & $XPEV, Wish Me Luckin",132,0.65,BIGJAYsmalljay,"Every time I see another pump article on the “next Chinese Tesla” because deliveries, I get triggered and have to put on chilled cow on spotify for 3 hours. Although entertaining, “NIO is going to squeeze like GME, all aboard!” comments on stocktwits is making my testicles feel like tiny furrowed cerebrums and not because it’s cold AF outside.

So I had to put together some pleb research on TSLA, NIO, XPENG & LI for you to scoff at. This is NOT financial advice, I just don’t like these stocks.

**1. Positions**

[https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo](https://imgur.com/qKMQHBo) Yeah my lazy ass needs to switch off.

A few more 2023s, I just went sniping randomly yesterday. Full disclosure, I also hold and sell CCs on my Tesla shares, so this play doubles as somewhat of a hedge for me. Sorry, not up to YOLO standards, I'm a lil biatch.

**2. The Chosen Ones: NIO & XPENG**

Did you ever look at TSLA and think, god damn that shit is overpriced? Then look at the price to sales and realize, holy fuck it is? Then looked at it a month later and the price doubled? Well guess what, NIO and XPENG are trading even higher than TSLA.

Current PS as of 2/10/2021

\- TSLA: \~25

\- NIO: \~40

\- XPENG: \~41

\- LI: \~19 (It’s because their flagship SUV is hybrid electric +ICE, insane PS reserved for pure bloods only)

Let’s compare. These guys aren't coding the next Gran Turismo 8, but let’s look at high margin tech anyways.

\- NFLX: \~10

\- ABNB: \~28

\- PLTR: \~72 (peter pan stock)

Actual automotives, old, unsexy, fell from grace, like your grandma’s teets

\- TM: \~0.8

\- F: \~0.4

\- VWAGY: \~0.5

I did some monkey spreadsheet math to forecast their updated TTM Revs after Q1. Don’t ask me how I did that, the answer either won’t impress you, or straight up glide over your smooth brain and I need you to focus on what’s important right now.

Q1 2021 PS if MC doesn’t change

\- TSLA: \~22

\- NIO: \~29

\- XPENG: \~26

\- LI: \~14

Yep, still overvalued AF. Before we get into the nuts and butts, there is always the risk (lotto upside in our case) that macros choke and correct >20% because of some black swan (I mean it’s 2020s, Murphy has been trying to prove a point). When this happens, we know what gets hit hardest, the ones with the high forwarding looking, rosy multiples. These EV stocks will get beat up worse than that washed up highschool varsity prom king’s girlfriend.

Some other lotto events include China stocks being delisted, and who can forget the audit risk on those poorly cooked books, but enough to win the Great Chinese Bake Off.

Can they grow Revenues though? Let's look.

**3. Revenue Growth Stunted**

You might be one of those Stocktwats and you’re thinking; “but but... they’ll ramp deliveries exponentially and grow Revenues just like TSLA did back in 2018!” \*Smacks you in the face\*, no they won’t and here is why.

Chinese people love brand name shit. I repeat, Chinese people love brand name shit. Quantitatively, go look at LVMH sales in China. The figures on Chinese tourists going on vacation, spending without looking at the price tag (naw they definitely check for them deals) is incredible. They’re not there to look at some antiquated tower (way better architecture back home), they tryin to get those furry Gucci Slips on discount (they are ugly AF btw). Tesla is no different, people worship Musk over there. You could probably sell his panties online, and some Chinese billionaire will pay millions for it, just like they did for his Gene Wilder house in LA. Qualitatively, I called my cousins in China, confirmed, he couldn’t stop jizzing at the slight mention of Tesla.

Why does this matter? Owning a TSLA is like owning any other brand name shit in China, social status. Social status is EVERYTHING to much more of the population in China vs. RoW. The biggest difference is, you’re not going to be able to buy a knock-off TSLA in some shady, cigarette smoking thug’s closet on the 2nd floor of a Chinese dumpling street stand.

TSLA just ramped the Model Y in China and started deliveries in Jan. [That shit sold out in a matter of days.](https://electrek.co/2021/01/06/tesla-sells-out-model-y-electric-suv-china/) If you’re not buying one, you basically have to settle for an uglier wife (this is probably not much of an exaggeration). Well guess who has been selling mostly midsize SUVs without much competition from TSLA and achieving recording breaking deliveries up until now?

NIO: 100% SUVs

Xpeng: 40% SUVs

Brand aside, some triggered specs nerd out there is thinking “Well, ultimately people will decide based on specs and value, not brand alone.” Fine, let’s take a look at what aspects of an EV people care about.

Let’s break it down apples to apples for these SUV EVs

Tesla Model Y- Price: \~$52,800

\- Range: 594 km (Kilometers for the apes)

\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.1s

\- Charger network: 20,000+

NIO EC6

\- Price: \~$57,200

\- Range: 430 km (605 if you pay \~$9k for a bigger battery)

\- 0-100km Acceleration: 5.4s

\- Charger network: 290+

Xpeng G3 520

\- Price: \~$30,580

\- Range: 520 km

\- 0-100km Acceleration: 8.6s

\- Charger network: 866+

You may be thinking the G3 520’s price tag is looking pretty attractive. Then you imagine the future wife you’ll be banging, yeah, trade up for that Tesla boi.

“But JJ, NIO has battery swap tech! It’s perfect for China’s dense cities!” If you know anything about product market fit, battery swapping for EVs is like trying to bang a gerbil's anus. First of all, battery swap stations are way more expensive to build, stock and maintain. Crazy upfront build out costs and battery requirements kill your rate of expansion (shit is important for demand). [Tesla superchargers are spreading like wildfire](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3120578/tesla-starts-v3-supercharger-production-new-shanghai-factory) and become recurring revenue generators over time, while battery swap stations stay cost centers over time, breakeven at best. That’s why NIO tries to charge a $150 subscription fee, I’d rather get pornhub subs for the whole family. Oh btw, you can’t even do it yourself, you have to give it to a service technician to do the swapping for you. Be realistic, these wealthy, classist Chinese dirtbags (I’m Chinese and know some first hand) don’t want some lowlife service tech to sit on their mothball leather.

Back to battery swapping and product market fit. Look, [Tesla tried this in 2013](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/tesla-shows-off-a-90-second-battery-swap-system-wants-it-at-supercharging-stations-by-years-end/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE0JxnRip8JKTQ9hYnvdEiU-EGgAt6RW47Mq0A7ZuzTcGFLVQKn_NUtf1M3CkQ2cr8dUxg3JtIp_G19l7z2s00l9g0WiGbkkMioZLCFNMr5D73kJ3LgwEAEXxNaD11mDTZCLIhfebIWvDzxCab8BRiANI1OHd1pocFU69FweZwNd), decided it was dumb, abandoned it and decided to make charging super fast and let you watch the actual Great British Bake Off while you wait. In 20 fuckin 13 some of you were still going through behavioral therapy and reading Robinhood as a picture book.

Lastly, the people buying EVs above the $50k range have easy access to charging, especially Tesla’s network. So, battery swapping for cars above $50k is serving a niche market, a handicap, and a money losing operation.

“But JJ… China EV Market Growth! They may have a smaller share right now, but the Pie grows for everyone!” Maybe, but if you look at [the 2020 EV market growth](https://insideevs.com/news/481465/china-plugin-car-sales-december-2020/), most of that came from guess who? Tesla. Oh, and a $8k mini, pretty much a golf kart that Tyrian would be uncomfortable in.

Solar & batteries are money losing businesses right now for Tesla, but people are pricing in some of those rosy projections into the valuation. Nio and Xpeng haven't even hinted at the idea because people in China live in 3D printed skyscraper boxes. Home solar and battery doesn’t make sense, but this also means no revenue opportunity.

Oh and let’s not forget about autonomy… no, let’s forget about it (for now).

International expansion you say? Sure Nio and Xpeng trying to expand oversees to... Norway. No way has the population size of a small Indian wedding. Let's be honest here, would americans buy a ""made in china"" EV over a Tesla or even Ford/GM EV? I'm Chinese and I wouldn't even fuckin touch that shit.

Back to Cars, to make matters worse for Chinese EV players, [Tesla has already designed a budget model](https://insideevs.com/news/486843/tesla-confirms-25k-car-sold-globally/). Unfortunately, it’ll be hard, like wiping ass with sandpaper, for Xpeng and Nio is follow suite in this space because of... MARGINS. Let's look at this next.

**4. Your margin is my opportunity - JB Retiree**

History lesson; how did China become #2 in GDP globally? They industrialized their massive population, kept the RMB artificially deflated to undercut the world through exports. Sure, quality suffered, but everything was ""made in china"" at some point. This is all to say, you can always increase demand by reducing price, and you can optimally reduce price if you have better margins than your competitors (or have the cash to sustain a loss to not bleed out before they do).

Let’s look at the current state of margins.

Q3 2020 Gross Margins

\- Tesla: 23.5%

\- Nio: 12.9%

\- Xpeng: 4.6%

\- Li Auto: 19.8%

We’ll have to revisit Q4 margins when everyone reports in a few weeks. But wow, it’s not even close for Nio and Xpeng. This is not even taking out Tesla’s solar & battery margins, which are negative, like when your mom finds out you YOLOed your college tuition on \[redacted\] at $400.

“But JJ, that’s not fair, Nio and Xpeng are still ramping!” First of all, so is Tesla, just on a larger scale. I mean, they are building factories like Starbucks locations. But fine, just taking a peak at margins for Tesla in earlier “ramp” years.

2017: 18.9%

2016: 22.8%

2015: 22.8%

This may not look right, something must be wrong you’re thinking. Well, let’s we take a look under the hood, you won’t find Trayvon Martin.

\- Battery is the main cost of an EV. Tesla has been working on battery tech from the beginning, they invented and are [retiring the “skateboard” design, saying it’s obsolete](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-retires-skateboard-vs-structural-batteries/) because they got something better, while Chinese EV companies are busy copying it. Ay caramba!

\- For the batteries them selves, just look at battery output distribution. Both Nio and Xpeng rely on CATL for their batteries in China. But so does everyone else at an Indian wedding, including Tesla. Either everyone is going to be supply limited, or someone is going to have to pay more. You can pay more when you have better margins to work with/bleed cash. At least Tesla will have their own way out soon enough.

[https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz](https://imgur.com/ZacBvhz)

Can you find Nio, Xpeng or Li Waldo?

\- Tesla’s electronics are industry leading, [Mario knows](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-sandy-munro-analyst-data-video/). Neo and Xpeng on the other hand outsources most of the Chips (Nvidia) and hardware (Mobile eye). When you outsource, you ultimately have less margin, control, speed and ability to freely synergize.

\- Tesla is also [literally stamping entire cars](https://electrek.co/2020/08/25/tesla-start-operations-worlds-largest-casting-machine/) like crispy cream donuts. It's almost if Chinese EVs are trying to take on Megatron’s fuckin Fusion Cannon with blow darts. Nio on the other hand [abandoned plans to make their own factory](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18252244/nio-ev-startup-factory-shanghai-cancelled-jac-motors) due to cash shortage and [partnered with JAC](https://cntechpost.com/2020/12/05/how-does-nio-build-cars/). A short term plat that won't help margins in the long run.

\- You know how Tim Apple gets a hard on every time he talks about service margins, EVs have some of that too.

\- In car entertainment: Tesla is building an app store, while Nio and Xpeng outsources

\- EV Charging: Tesla has the biggest network, Nio has $ losing battery swap, while Xpeng relied on and pays government network

\- Connectivity: Startlink? \*shrugs\*

\- Autonomous driving: Tesla is rolling out subs for FSD, and I wouldn’t trust Nio and Xpeng’s software with your wife’s boyfriend’s life

**5. Closing**

Look, Nio is backed by Tencent and Bidu. Xpeng is backed by Ali. Their balance sheets pass the acid test with flying colors, so they can bleed cash for awhile. But Tesla has a meme lord at the helm. Let’s not forget some of the giant local players like BYD, who is backed by Bigly Buffet himself. There is also SAIC, Great Wall, Geely, BAIC, Chang Jiang, Kandi, and dozens more names you don't know, just like the name of your cousin's mail in bride. Tesla copy cats are literally coming out of the woodworks, when buyers have a paradox of choice, the clear pick defaults back to the trusted brand, guess who?

CCP has already been 3 steps ahead of Biden (I mean, who isn't, lol) and EV bullish years ago. Matter of fact, EV subsidies (which Nio and Xpeng survive off of like a bums on opioids in the streets of San Francisco) are already [getting cut by 20% in 2021, and phased out by 2022](https://fortune.com/2021/01/05/china-electric-vehicle-subsidies-sales-tesla/). I'll let you figure out what happens to deliveries when subsidies get cut, again comes back to magins and cash. If it comes down to EV price wars, I don't think it'll be Nio and Xpeng winning the bleed out. It'll be more like Matrix 3, rather than 1.

I’m no voodoo magic chart nerd, but Nio tested $65 resistance again yesterday and failed. Xpeng in general looks like it’s peaked. Google search interest has spiked and all the little virgin armchair analysts on YouTube have pumped it 10 times over. I’ll wait for their earning numbers in a few weeks to take the temperature again. I'll likely add more to the position then, will update.

At the end of the day, Nio and Xpeng may trade sideways for much longer than I can stay solvent, but fuck it, I’ve spent too much time on this, so sunk cost is set in hard, change my mind.

TL;DR Not sure when, but bet on EV bubble popping with Puts on Nio and Xpeng. Better to sit on the side lines for Tesla and Li Auto",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljwqf5/celebrate_chinese_new_year_with_puts_on_nio_xpev/,1613363664.0

Feel free to criticize any part of the DD, and I will use it as a learning experience. My main goal is to be able to learn how to identify investment opportunities. I am not a financial advisor. This is purely for entertainment purposes only. Do your own DD before you make any decisions.

Disclaimer: I own 60 shares of BALY (I know I'm a small player...trying to grow one play at a time).

So, a friend of mine, who works and lives in Atlantic City, NJ, mentioned that Bally's (a casino in Atlantic City) has been on a spending spree lately. He sent me this article. [Bally's acquires SportCaller free-play game provider](https://apnews.com/article/atlantic-city-sports-betting-46689f9a2b6421467ce415db076ebe9b)

What caught my eye was this paragraph: ""SportCaller is but the latest acquisition for Bally's which recently added BetWorks and Monkey Knife Fight."" It was interesting that a casino was purchasing Sports related assets. In light of the success of DKNG, this was intriguing to me. So, I started to dig deeper.

Here is a timeline of the acquistions:

April 2020:

January 2021:

[Bally's acquires SportCaller free-play game provider](https://apnews.com/article/atlantic-city-sports-betting-46689f9a2b6421467ce415db076ebe9b)

Putting all this together, this is what it looks like to me. An ambitious play by a little known branded casino to use the brand recognition of the Bally’s name to compete on the ever expanding online sports betting arena. I believe if they are able to execute on their plan to enter and grab market share in the blooming online sports betting arena, this stock has an opportunity to return capital.

Some additional notes, it's a relatively thin stock. Only 30.46 outstanding shares. BETZ, the Roundhill Sports Betting ETF, reported the addition of BALY to its holdings in January ([link to source here](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sports-betting-etf-adds-4-new-components-including-another-spac-2021-01-19)) ([BETZ holdings](https://www.roundhillinvestments.com/etf/betz/full-holdings)) . They report earnings March 04, 2021. Market Cap as of 2/12/2021: $1.83B. (Market cap of DKNG as of 2/12/21: $23.92B, not saying this will be DKNG, but helpful to know). Reported earnings 2020: Q1: $109m, Q2: $28m, Q3: $116m.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading! Any and all criticisms and praise welcome.

Edit:

101,Generac ($GNRC) DD,37,0.68,jduggan124,"Hello you actual dumbasses

This is a company that I think would be a long term move - market cap of $20b - total revenue at over $2b - and some smart money makin moves in   the meantime, but I don't know SHIT

Definitely not a get rich quick type of ticker, but looks good for that smooth brain ride you all care about.

Generac  is the leading manufacturer in power backup and generation systems. They produce home and commercial backup equipment up to 2mw, as well as have lines of power-washers, snowblowers, and other motored chore equipment. They are the number one provider of their products in North America. Recently they have budded into clean energy with the Generac PWRcell, a competitor to the Tesla (simmer down) Powerwall with the option to choose different sizes at different price ranges (something Papa Elon's baby lacks). In November they announced they were taking over the Harley Davidson Roadhouse to create the Generac Power Stage at the Milwaukee World Festival , a popular venue for concerts and other performances (it's a new source of revenue but ik who the fuck cares).   Recently Generac also announced that they are opening a new production facility in South Carolina providing 450 jobs. This is to deal with the increase in demand and for larger production capabilities in the future. As more people work from home and extreme weather related power outages become increasingly frequent these backup systems are becoming critical to many households across the world.

(here boy 🚀)

On   top of all this the management is a bunch of Milwaukee bulls. Our boy Aaron Judgefield sits at CEO/President has worked at Generac for a whopping 26 years from an accountant all the to his current position as head hog. This All-American slab of ground beef will fuck your wife before you knew he threw you out of bed, and I trust he has a stake in the well-being of the company given his long history. Most of the top management has spent years at this company, and they've only made money   moves so you're choice.

In Q3 2020  Generac saw a 17% increase in sales, and beat expected EPS for the  5th  quarter in a row. This brought a 2020 net sales of $2.48 billion,  which  is up two billion from last year. GNRC did this while doubling  their  cash in hand from $322 to $655 million. Debt has only increased  slightly  for the amount of bills they're taking in. By 2026 the home  generator  market alone is estimated to be worth $7.6 with GNRC looking  to be the  top dawg among suppliers.

Current  ticker is at $326 (2/13), but price targets have been adjusted from under $250 to $360 by a few different firms (Goldman, JPMorgan, Roth, Oppenheimer). Average target $346 with the high hovering at $400. We don't talk about the low.

102,Unilever $UL - Why this oversold boomer stock will surge once the $1400 stimulus cheques drop.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,128,0.76,soupstock123,"From the moment your mom's boyfriend changed your diaper to last Wednesday when you opened up pornhub and did two pumps of vaseline, you've been using Unilever products. Dove soap, Lipton Tea, Ben & Jerry's, Vaseline, Klondike and every goddamn tea or shampoo you've ever used is straight from UL. UL, like a lot of consumer discretionary stocks, has been declining since consumer spending and buying power have increased due to all the stimulus checks Americans have been getting .... oh wait. This represents an opportunity to take long positions on UL since consumer spending is expected to return to normal levels once those stimmy checks drop and UL's huge catalogue of food, personal care, and household care products will absorb those sales. 


Main Points:  

1. The first wave of Biden's 1.9 Trillion Stimulus, $1400 checks will sent via direct deposit during the week of March 8, paper checks will be sent on the week of March 22. People are going to spend these on staples like food, toiletries, and household items.

2. UL from the technicals is currently [oversold](https://imgur.com/a/y2Ui62v). Shit crop I know, but I'm too lazy to redo it. Support has been established at 53.9 and has been holding the last week. The RSI on the daily chart reached 26 a few days go, and is currently in the low 30s. 

Options are quite cheap on UL rn. I would have got more but I loaded up on LI at around 30ish last week. 

TLDR: Consumer spending low rn. 1400 dolla stimmy checks is basically giving free money to food, personal care, and home care companies like UL.

103,$BNTX massively undervalued - the COVID guys,None,0.46,OliBolly,"Hi fellow retards,

long term $BB and $AMD investor here. Wanted to point your short attention span to a massively undervalued, hidden champion from the COVID vaccine and cancer treatment world:

**$BNTX** 

**Some facts**

* They own one of two **actually working COVID vaccines** (mRNA). *COVID is this thing that keeps you at home, in case you didn't realize.*
* They have a **50/50 commercial agreement with Pfizer** (sharing cost and revenue)
* US paid **$19.90** per dose - poorer countries pay probably less, richer more- **assuming an average revenue of $10** per dose here
* Their 2021 production capacity just increased to max. **2bn doses/year** 
* Based on this, I'm estimating a **$20bn** (that's 10 zeros) FY2021 revenue**, Pfizer and BioNTech combined on the vaccine only**, up from a few hundred k in 2020. 
* Expected net **profit $10bn** for BioNTech 
* BNTX's market cap just $21bn - that could make a **four or five bagger** from here
* Vaccine **can be easily adjusted** to target new mutants - and won't need lengthy re-approvals (see Reuters news today). 
* Your wife's boyfriend will probably need **two fresh shots every year** to stay safe  
* **Biontech CEO Ugur is on a mission - cycling to the lab (**Papa factor)
* COVID is just a side-business - they have a healthy cancer treatment pipeline
* **Q4 2020 earnings call expected for March**

104,OSTK - A Sleeping Giant with Deep Value,2510,0.88,Variation-Separate,"**OSTK is undervalued**. At first glance, one may wonder does a stock with a >4000% run from its 52-week low and up 54% YTD have room to grow?

**Point 1:** There has not been broader market interest in this stock in over a year. Put simply, demand for shares as examined through volume traded at 1D, 1M, 1 quarter, as well as 1 year averages is at a low.

[Fig 1 - OSTK overview](https://preview.redd.it/4fwgbra2lih61.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=00f85d806f01c47f65ad010a3981b60ee7bf68ce)

**Point 2:** OSTK trades at a significant discount relative to its competitor W which currently trades 2x sales and OSTK trades 1.1x sales. The best market comparison to OSTK at the moment is Wayfair (W).

[Fig 2 - OSTK and W relative comparisons](https://preview.redd.it/n0vk6gc5lih61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=e28eca64e8d10be029dce04ef5fee1581a9c9225)

**Point 3:** Institutional ownership of OSTK is growing. 1 month ago, institutional changes in ownership of OSTK increased dramatically by 40% through large tutes such as Morgan Stanley, Allianz SE, Blackrock, and Vanguard as well. In fact, Blackrock was against OSTK's direction towards digital blockchain technology last year. [https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/press-release/blk-vote-bulletin-overstock-feb-2020.pdf](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/press-release/blk-vote-bulletin-overstock-feb-2020.pdf)

Last week, Allianz SE increased it's stake to 7.5%.

[Fig 3 - Bloomie institutional data](https://preview.redd.it/68kml1a8lih61.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=73f684e7ee5daa2ebb826024e1e9d96aa022d004)

**Point 4:** OSTK has short interest of over 10%. With 42.77 million shares outstanding, and a 40 million share float, latest NASDAQ filing data still show that over 4.374 million shares are currently held short. While that may seem relatively small, naked short selling is still occurring with 16 SEC fail-to-delivers during January occurring on OSTK.

Legendary short trader Marc Cohodes is long on this name and I learned about this stock from his posts on Twitter.

**Point 5:** OSTK through tZERO addresses an emerging need of broker-dealer issues (\*cough\* Robinhood \*cough\*) and transparency at the right time. Briefly, tZero is an alternative trading system **regulated** by the SEC that will enable people to invest in **any** asset using a tokenized system with the goal of ending settlement times. Think of a one stop shop for c$rypto, tokenized securities, and stocks.

Current assets include OSTKO, tZEROp, ASPD. With the acquisition of Bitt: B/T/C, E/T/H, L/T/C, and RVN are now tradeable. The current roadmap is to have traditional securities such as stocks traded on the platform by Q4 2021.

[Fig 5 - tZERO trading volume](https://preview.redd.it/b4jyb74elih61.png?width=3284&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9af5bbe4794c9067dd22fb60792bf942598d8d9)

[Fig 6 - tZERO $ nominal trading volume](https://preview.redd.it/swgb2o1hlih61.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1f12882ff8c6c34e6d12df252871cc6f0a6f94a)

**Point 5:** OSTK holds a 90% stake in tZERO. tZERO is nascent. With only $53 million traded in digital token securities, this is small to other markets and exchanges. However, this represents a 10x fold increase from 2019 to 2020.

Numbers on the actual c$ryptocurrency volumes and $ volume traded are less clear. The latest information revealed a 32x increase in $ volume year-to-year traded.

Coinbase had $923 million in revenue in 2017 with a trading volume of 41 billion. In 2020, it had a revenue of $2.3 billion with a valuation of $75 billion. Coinbase does not offer trading other tokenized securities nor does it offer trading of traditional securities like stocks.

Napkin math: simply assume that tZERO has 1/30th the revenue across all securities ($53 million in digital tokens + $13 million in c$rypto = $67 million), this implies tZero has a valuation of $2.5 billion when compared to Coinbase. Once the valuations of these two companies becomes more clear, OSTK valuation will reach closer to its true value.

[Fig 7 - Coinbase revenue](https://preview.redd.it/vxnyrjzllih61.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f3d11ee7aa6852ff0f4826b829376028a61b6fa)

DYOR. Know your risk. Size appropriately. Manage your own trade.

Important areas to watch next 130, 172, 256, 394, 482, 512.

**tl;dr Fundamental dislocation and valuation of OSTK is leading to a large mispricing event where the market cannot effectively evaluate OSTK's true value.**

On a simple relative valuation, OSTK at parity to W should trade at 200/share given same P/S ratios. Once the valuation of tZERO is more properly priced in to OSTK, tZERO in and of itself could be closer to the same valuation of OSTK. This does not include future performance, multiples, or other blockchain businesses such as Voatz that OSTK has a stake in.

Q4 earnings 2/24/21.

Potential headwinds: Execution by management of their timeline for tZERO's rollout. Failure to get FINRA approval for stocks. G20 simultaneous regulation of c$ryptocurrencies. Slowing down of the economy and appetite for risk assets such as c$ryptocurrenices in 2H 2021.

105,"There is officially a silver shortage, and silver miners ($AG and $SILJ) are going to triple by May. This isn't a squeeze - it's a bank run.",1727,0.71,ephyfish,"The U.S. Mint just admitted [they can't print enough](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-precious-coins-demand/us-mint-unable-to-meet-demand-for-gold-silver-bullion-coins-idUSL1N2K82XU) silver and gold coins to meet demand. CNBC has it wrong - this didn't start with WSB. People are losing faith in the dollar and wanna hold fucking metal.

You don't think there's a shortage? Go try to buy a 1,000 ounce bar of silver. Google it. If you happen to find a dealer who isn't out of stock, you'll be paying an insane premium over the spot price.

I'm not gonna get into all the silver manipulation conspiracies. Let's stick to Retard Economics 101: if there's a shortage of the good it means the price is too damn low.

Because of the differential between the physical spot price of silver, and the futures price in the COMEX there's an arbitrage: Anybody with any serious cash today could take silver delivery from the COMEX at $27, and quickly flip it for well over $30. Futures deliveries last year were already at a record:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/djlle4wb8hh61.png?width=1466&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd198b6fa8db58121a9654f2e46fe668ec342268

But the amount of folks standing for March delivery might just break the bank... because there's just not enough Silver to deliver to everyone who wants it. That's why (as another WSB post already detailed) The SLV ETF amended their prospectus to basically say [we can't actually get the silver that we need.](https://twitter.com/BullionStar/status/1360703958029905921)

If silver futures start creeping up, this thing could completely snowball. Because those industrial consumers of silver - Tesla, Apple, Medical stuff - absolutely cannot afford to have their production lines shut down for a month because of one input, and will pay anything to make sure they get those 1k bars in hand.

How to make tendies? Look what happened to AG and SILJ a few weeks ago when Silver went up 9%. Those two tickers FLEW. Buy calls on them for July if you're responsible, April if you're a degenerate gambler.

How to do your part and make sure the squeeze happens? Buy PSLV. That fund is going to actually take delivery of 1,000 ounce bars on your behalf.

Positions: $PSLV shares, $AG July calls, strike 20,  $SILJ August calls strike 25.

DON'T BUY $SLV

EDIT: I received a message from a smart dude suggesting that this news actually means that $SLV is vulnerable, and buying it is also a direct way to create tightness in the silver market. Could be.

106,Why I think AMD is going up a lot soon,1981,0.91,longi11,"Corona\`s main economic impact is supply chain disruptions that are unprecedented. Before Covid supply chain was running smooth as a glove, think of it as a highway full of cars flowing at exact same speed and spaced equally. This supply chain was being perfected for over a decade. And then this shitstorm happened. The highway is clogged, ships are standing loaded with crap they cannot effectively unload quick enough, there aren\`t enough ships to move products that are needed. Including basic materials for industries and intermediate components to make a final product.

For those who don\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Spanning from AMD/NVDA CPUs and GPUs, to auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics. Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.

The main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead) 

The perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.

&#x200B;

1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)
2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.
3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . 
4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.

To recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID

107,Why you actually should consider CRSR,416,0.84,npiterman,"In case you live under a rock, [CRSR is growing faster than it can handle and remains supply limited](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020)

Corsair just moved very aggressively into SSDs and dominates the RAM market. A chip company  growing revenue at 80% should be valued more like AMD or NVDA.

For some reason, I still associate Corsair with their peripherals such as mice and keyboards. They also do gaming chairs, ring lights, green screens, microphones, headphones... If you compare them to their peer Logitech (LOGI), Corsair is growing revenue at a faster rate, but has lower profit margins. I have all the aforementioned stockerinos, but I generally favor growth over profitability.

108,Unga bunga unga bunga: At&t DD,21,0.64,potatoandbiscuit,"Reasons to buy T leaps/shares.

1. It’s HBO Max/HBO has gathered 41M subscribers in the US till now. It will go higher. A lot higher(although there's some difficulty in its pricing structure due to its TV ventures, but this problem will eventually be mitigated).
It’s quality of programs is also subjectively better in my opinion compared to Netflix/Disney's offerings.

If management decides to go bold(which they probably won't), and declares some good shit targets like Disney. You can be ready for an explosive ride.

2. 1M+ fiber optics net addition and this will go much more higher in the future. Fiber optics based internet is the real thing(if you subscribed to one, it's hard to think of anything else, kinda like display tech); unless of course you think Elon will eat this lunch in 2030.

3. After Covid-19 thingy ends at the end of 2021, it’s mobile related revenue will increase. Plus, 5g will slightly help(that's what others are saying).

4. It’s not ATH. Leaps and shares are not really that expensive. One can sell CC, after getting shares, not a terrible investment in any sense. Plus, F are not bad for this company; one could even argue that they are great, though it is not upon oneself to utter the F word.

5. Warner Media related losses will probably decline pretty quickly.

6. Their debt load is declining and would probably decline more in the coming years and quarters. Especially, expensive debt is declining.
One could argue that their debt is unsustainable, but then you would also have to say TSLA's debt load is unsustainable.

Everyone and their mother in the S&P 500 is loaded with debt, and if inflation truly comes after the end of 2021, having more debt is good, not bad.

7. Overall, I would say, in T's case, more doom and gloom is being priced in. Its potential is being mispriced.

8. If ever the management decides to not pay dividend any more, the stock would tumble for a bit and then skyrocket to infinity and beyond.

9. DirecTV will be probably sold. Granted it was a complete waste of time to begin with.

Reasons not to buy leaps/shares.

1. It’s a dividend paying stock. Which means one can easily calculate the true price of something rather than relying on some FCF predictions which are absolutely ridiculous(one can make a serious DD with FCF calculation of TSLA with the revenue being equivalent to the GDP of Canada and FCF being something even more ridiculous).

That means, as long as the company pays this huge amount of dividend, the stock would have to remain connected to reality. The meme that, ""invest for the 5% dividend, lose 10% in stock decline is kinda...""

2. 5g investments would make it incur more debt.

3. Management expects only 1% growth in 2021. But again, my common sense tells me, when the time comes for pricing in the growth at the end of 2021, it would probably be already too late to enter. Or maybe, I am wrong.

4. There's no short squeeze opportunity in this stock. Short interest is below 2%.

7. Some of its investments and ventures are now kinda like ICE manufacturers' valuations. People are giving even negative valuations in this sphere. I don't know if it’s negative or not, but it probably isn’t much.

*That's all.*

I think, given the bull case and bear case, bull case outweighs the bear cases substantially and the stock has substantial room to run in the future. That's why, I think leaps or shares would be the best to get into this play.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljlatb/unga_bunga_unga_bunga_att_dd/,1613323188.0
109,Why XM is the Most Underrated High Growth Stock,21,0.62,runboli,"Qualtrics (ticker XM) IPO'd on Jan 28th and has received little attention compared to other IPOs this year. It initially shot up from $41 to $57 and has since sold off to $45 as of Feb 12.

Qualtrics sells subscription SAAS products that allow companies to obtain and track data on customer, product, and employee experiences. Like other SAAS companies, XM's gross margins are 75%, and it currently has a market cap of $23 billion.

Here's why Qualtrics is the most underrated high growth stock:

\- With 2020 revenue of $763 million and 31% revenue growth between 2019 and 2020, Qualtrics will reach $1 billion revenue in 2021 assuming a conservative flat growth rate. This is a forward Price to Sales ratio of 23, over 2x cheaper than other software database companies including SNOW, PLTR, and DDOG.

\- SAP owns 80% of outstanding shares, with at least an additional 5% owned by institutions. With minimal float, the stock is primed to rise quickly with any news, including coverage initiations and institutional purchases over next few weeks as Qualtrics gains more attention.

\- The stay-at-home trend means more businesses are investing in remote work tools and services, creating demand for experience management products. Qualtrics increased its customers from 9,000 to 13,000 in the past 2 years, and the digital shift caused by COVID will only accelerate this growth.

\- Technically, the stock is ready to bounce. In the past 6 trading days, selling has been consistently decreasing in magnitude and volume, and this week, the trend looks like it's going to reverse.

And they still haven’t hit their pre-Corona highs. If you don’t already know, I’m talking about Hasbro. They literally make every single toy that you loved as a kid, and now, that you love buying for your kids.  Believe it or not, but Corona isn’t going away and parents will need to keep their annoying kids entertained for another year at home. 

Disney+ also just announced about 52 new Star Wars shows and if you know anything about Star Wars fans, they fucking love their merchandise. And guess what, Hasbro makes it. 

Lastly, and I know nothing about this but we’ve all heard of the game. Magic the Gathering. Apparently they’ve doubled their player base in 2020 and expect to double again by ‘23.  Literally millions of people buy these cards.  As states loosen restrictions and they can have their live tournaments, card sales are going to rocket.

For those that know about Trivago, it essentially serves as a price comparison tool for multiple travel sites and it allows you to book hotels.  This is a recovery play that may or may not pan out, I believe that the floor for Trivago is probably around 2.00 right now so you may see those prices should this fail to pan out. Also, Expedia is a large owner in Trivago and Trivago is a European based company. Trivago is a cost per click business that essentially puts multiple pricing on the same site and lets the customer compare. With Leisure travel picking back up and companies desperate for cashflow, Trivago might find companies being more aggressive on customer acquisition. Trivago may benefit with these surges.

I am buying shares and selling covered calls A 5.00. I believe 5.00 is my exit price for the stock as of right now. If something big happens like an adjacent expansion then this might move, but I am going to sell monthly covered call @ 5.00.

# Beaten Down Stocks Respond Aggressively to good news

* Often time stocks that are at all time lows just need a single small catalyst to respond aggressively to the upside.
   * Gamestop's investment from Ryan Cohen is an example of a catalyst that drove a huge increase in Gamestop's game price.
* A few years ago Trivago was trading at \~23.00 dollars per share. As of Friday it was trading around 3.00, an 87% decrease. As of two years ago, it was in the mid to high single digits.
* Revenue has steadily declined for a few years and the pandemic itself was no help.
   * A new large partnership, or an adjacent product category expansion like airline travel or car rentals are a potential catalyst.
* The recovery will begin mid year

* The airline industry is struggling and they are desperate for cash flow. Airlines will have reason to push for low cost or at cost flights to ensure they are maximizing their cash flow on their assets,
* Airlines are going to most likely focus on efficiency this year and continue to have less flights with higher occupancy.
* Studies are showing that the pandemic has pushed people to the point where they will travel and this summer could set records.

112,Inminent bull run for the Uranium market?,356,0.83,HomoSapien-sa,"# The world needs clean-air energy

There is growing recognition of the role nuclear power must play in providing safe, reliable, affordable carbon-free baseload electricity and achieving a low-carbon future. Examples of this growing recognition include:

* Many countries, US states, and utilities announced net-zero carbon targets in 2020. While most of these targets are further out in the future, many of the plans include an important role for nuclear. For example, a study suggests that for China to achieve its net-zero target by 2060, will require a 382% increase in nuclear power from 2025 levels.
* In the US, President Biden’s campaign included positive statements about the need to maintain the existing nuclear power fleet and to build advanced reactors as part of an overall shift to non-emitting carbon power sources.
* Japan’s Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga, announced that the country aims to become carbon neutral by 2050. Regarding nuclear, he indicated Japan will continue to develop its nuclear energy supply with “maximum priority on safety”. Japan’s current energy plan calls for 20% to 22% nuclear by 2030.
* In France, President Macron stated in December that nuclear will remain a pillar of the French energy mix for decades to come and pressed for preparatory studies on new next-generation EPR reactors to be wrapped up in the coming months.
* The Netherlands announced they will begin a process that considers building up to 10 nuclear power plants.
* According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, there are currently 443 reactors operating globally and 52 reactors under construction. With a number of reactor construction projects recently approved, and many more planned, the demand for uranium is growing.

# Supply-Demand

Like other commodities, **the uranium industry is cyclical.** History demonstrates that in general, when prices are rising and high, uranium is perceived as scarce, and a lot of contracting activity takes place. The heavy contracting that takes place during price runs, drives investment in higher-cost sources of production. Once that production is in the market, it tends to stay in the market longer than is economically rational, creating the perception that uranium is abundant and always will be, and prices decline. When prices are declining and low, like we have seen over the past number of years, there is no perceived urgency to contract, and contracting activity and investment in new supply drops off. **After years of low investment in supply, as has been the case since 2011, security of supply tends to overtake price concerns at some point, and utilities re-enter the long-term market to ensure they have the reliable supply of uranium they need to run their reactors.**

Customers do not go to the market right before they need to load uranium into their reactors. To operate a reactor that could run for more than 60 years, natural uranium and the downstream services have to be purchased years in advance, allowing time for a number of processing steps before it arrives at the power plant as a finished fuel bundle. The longer the recovery of the long-term market is delayed, the less certainty there will be about the availability of future supply to fill growing demand. **Recent data from the US Energy Information Administration shows that utility inventories are starting to decline and are approaching levels that could put security of supply at risk, there is a significant amount of uranium that needs to be contracted to keep reactors running into the next decade.**

As utilities’ uncovered requirements grow, annual supply declines, demand for uranium from producers and financial players increases, and with trade policy potentially restricting access to some markets, the pounds available in the spot market will not be adequate to satisfy the growing backlog of long-term demand. As a result, **there will be increased competition to secure uranium under long-term contracts on terms that will ensure the availability of reliable primary supply to meet growing demand.**

Global population is on the rise, and there is a growing focus on electrification and decarbonization. With the world’s need for safe, clean, reliable baseload energy, nuclear remains an important part of the energy mix. With demand increasing due to restarts and new reactors, and supply becoming less certain as a result of low prices, production curtailments, lack of investment, and end of reserve life, unplanned production disruptions, shrinking secondary supplies and trade policy issues, a market transition is expected.

113,Now is the best time to buy cruise ship calls (NCLH) (xpost r/options),178,0.72,KRAndrews,"tl;dr NCLH calls = 🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕

There are very few industries that have been completely, 100% shut down for the entirety of the pandemic. The cruiseship industry is one of them. There’s a lot of fear around the stock, but now that vaccine distribution is on the rise it’s inevitable that cruising will resume. For cruise line companies, the strategy is simple: if you have proof of being vaccinated, you can board the ship… the only issue is the government giving them the go-ahead, which is just a matter of time.

The way I see it, there are three ways you can approach this opportunity.

**Low risk**: buy NCLH shares and hold

**Medium risk**: Jan 21 2022 $30c

**The WSB special**: Sep 17 2021 ???c

I have done all three. 472 shares at $17.56, 4x Jan 21 2022 $30c, 3x Sep 17 $17.50c.

**WHAT THE WORRIERS SAY:**

-“New vaccine-resistant covid mutation will ruin everything.” Seems unlikely, and even if it happens it could be months after you already cash in.

-“The shares have been diluted.” Yes, it won’t return to the $60 highs anytime soon… but it doesn’t have to. Optimistically, the shares could reach $40 if there’s proof of cruising being successful again.

-“Bu-bu-but Canada delayed crusiing until 2022!"" (https://www.travelandleisure.com/cruises/canada-bans-cruise-ships-until-2022 ) Nobody cares about Canada. Maple syrup is overrated.

114,MVIS: Shiny Laser Go Pew ⚡ No But Seriously They Are Gonna Take Over The LiDAR Industry,1507,0.92,BigBlackWifey,"So, the day has come, and MicroVision's market cap is finally big enough so that you won't get banned for mentioning it on WSB. But what is it? Why have they seen an 800%+ increase in three months? Where are they headed? Allow me to explain.

**About Them**

MicroVision, Inc. (MVIS) makes futuristic-as-fuck laser technology that's used in self driving cars and augmented reality headsets. This already sets them apart from a major competitors like Velodyne (VLDR), which focuses solely on LiDAR for self driving cars.

Sumit Sharma, the CEO, was head of operations at Google's Project GLASS and has worked to map hardware development at Motorola, also worked at Jawbone.[ Source](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/brooklinerunner?challengeId=AQG9ZZGeKX9VWgAAAXec1fLslGoC7UaTFwCgduU3ajjeIw_gMofulYMLCHKxKwfCHu5xLOoDIeF-4bS-FWdNj62xNtLfDVTmBQ&submissionId=a9151f8a-df64-6316-dda0-24150063286d)

Why have they been increasing 800% in three months while similar companies in the same sector see a fraction of that gain?

**Because their tech is much more advanced than the competition, and they were (are) criminally undervalued.**

The reason they're so undervalued is because the first thing hedge funds see when they research a potential investment is the balance sheet, and on paper MVIS looks like shit. (Low assets, high liabilities) Even I saw the movement back in December, did some research, and was like ""Wtf is this? I need to get puts"" But once you do research into their product, who their customers are, and the future of the industry that they are involved in, you see that MicroVision is a turnaround story similar to that of Plug Power; both are 90's futuristic companies that people got way too excited about in 2000, have struggled to make it to 2020, but now are about to finally have their heyday. And they got a $13 million [equity facility (loan) in December](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/29/2151422/0/en/MicroVision-Announces-13-Million-At-the-Market-Equity-Facility.html) that greatly improved their balance sheet, making them appeal to institutions, and bringing [Vanguard](https://fintel.io/so/us/mvis/vanguard-group) and [Blackrock to invest](https://fintel.io/so/us/mvis/blackrock) in MVIS days later. I actually had a hedge fund manager tell me that MVIS was doomed to run out of cash in Q1 2020, but if they secured funds then they would have a lot of potential. I go over that in the comments.

[ MVIS \(left\) vs PLUG \(right\) 1990's until present ](https://preview.redd.it/803a6oge9dh61.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=d889603b5691f3b12126c5807db5752804598a63)

Anyways, what is this ""much more advanced"" technology? I'll just let this chart do the talking:

[ The MicroVision Consumer LIDAR being compared here isn't even their model designed for self-driving cars, that will be coming in April.](https://preview.redd.it/c3zdfgwh9dh61.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae8c428f74846c15e06c16c0bbdf270a9fcb9bf8)

The resolution it can take as input/second, the points per second, is key when it comes to how clearly the LiDAR sensor can see, how accurately it can identify what it is seeing, and how quickly it can react.

That chart is from 2 years ago and *still* the best resolution Velodyne can provide today is only 4,800,000 pps in their most advanced model, the ""[Alpha Prime](https://velodynelidar.com/downloads/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)""

>3D Lidar Data Points Generated 2- Single Return Mode: \~ 2,400,000 points per second- Dual Return Mode: \~ 4,800,000 points per second.

VLDR has not publicly announced a price for their Alpha Prime yet, but historically their top of the line devices cost[ $75,000](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055011/lidar-sensor-self-driving-mainstream-mass-market-velodyne-ces-2020).

They did [announce a $500 model](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2020/11/13/velodyne-announces-500-velarray-h800-lidar-production-in-2021/?sh=4a37f2246e8f) called the Velarray H800 in November, but the only thing they said about its pps resolution is that its [""outstanding""](https://velodynelidar.com/press-release/velodyne-lidar-unveils-breakthrough-solid-state-lidar-sensor/)... lol.

As for Luminar (LAZR),[ they will launch the new model ""Iris"" in 2022, which will cost about $1,000:](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/luminar-eyes-production-vehicles-with-100m-round-and-new-iris-lidar-platform/) (the[ same price](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microvision-inc-announces-progress-automotive-210500945.html) as MicroVision's device to be revealed in April). It will also only operate at 10Hz. This is similar to playing a racing game at 10FPS. If you know anything about video games, you know that **this is unplayable.**

>Iris will cost less than $1,000 per unit for production vehicles seeking serious autonomy, and for $500 you can get a more limited version for more limited purposes like driver assistance, or ADAS. Luminar says Iris is 'slated to launch commercially on production vehicles beginning in 2022,' but that doesn't mean necessarily that it's shipping to customers right now. The company is negotiating more than a billion dollars in contracts at present, a representative told me, and 2022 would be the earliest that vehicles with Iris could be made available.

A[ lengthy post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k7bzrk/race_to_mass_production_luminar_lazr_vs/) has been make comparing Luminar's resolutions with MicroVision's, which was not easy to calculate because Luminar said their resolution was ""300dpi/spdeg"", a statistic that is incomprehensible for shareholders because its not the common specification of millions (3D) points per second. Here's the math, I sum it all up at the bottom:

>Luminar's Hydra claims resolution of ""**up to** 200 points per square degree"" and a FOV of 120° x 30° (degrees). (and 300 points for Iris, the one coming in 2022.)

>However, the vertical FOV can be configured from 1° to 30° , which likely explains the use of ""up to"" in the resolution numbers. Generally, as FOV expands, resolution shrinks, assuming a constant pixel stream. This is why Alex Kipman made such a big deal about MSFT maintaining resolution in Hololens 2(YT links aren't allowed apparently) while expanding FOV because it required more pixels to do so.

>Specifically, regarding Luminar, is 200 points per square degree available when FOV is at the maximum 120° x 30°? Or is it available only at a lesser FOV such as, for example, 120° x 5°? The use of ""up to"" suggests the latter.  
>  
>Even assuming 200 points per square degree at 120° x 30° is available, which is not conceded given the stated ""up to"", that would yield a total resolution of 720,000 points. MVIS claims capacity in excess of 20M points per second. At a resolution of 720,000 points, Luminar would require a frame rate of 27.7 Hz to equal 20M points per second. Luminar's specs do not suggest that its technology is capable of such a high frame rate at this resolution. This is not surprising given it does not use MEMS micromirrors but something more ""mechanical"" including, as per a recent patent,[ spindles and a drive belt](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10310058B1/en?oq=US10310058B1)  
>  
>(1) At video time **19:56**, Luminar compares the specs of its Iris product to industry requirements. The graphic reveals that Luminar's 2022 production lidar, **Iris**, will support resolution of **300 points per square degree at 10 Hz**. Assuming that resolution applies to the entire FOV of 120 x 30 degrees and not just a portion of the FOV, that would imply a points per second value of 120 x 30 x 300 x 10 Hz = **10.8M points per second**. If the 300 points/ sq. deg applies only to a smaller FOV, the points per second figure would be proportionally smaller. Microvision claims **20M points per second** for its current MEMS lidar. The company also advises that its technology is capable of more than 20M points/sec.

TLDR: The best case scenario for Luminar is that their 2022 model will have 10.8 million pps, but in reality its probably much lower than that because of FOV configurations, careful wording by press releases, and Hz limitations. Additional Interesting insight on Luminar and their tech lagging behind is in the comments, this post is long enough already.

Again the [MicroVision Consumer LIDAR](http://www.microvision.com/consumer-lidar/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) ([specifications](http://www.microvision.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MEMS-Based-3D-LiDAR-Engine-Product-Brief.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) being used for comparison here isn't even their model designed for self-driving cars. Their device specialized for cars, the ""1st gen Long Range LiDAR (LRL) Sensor"",[ will be coming in April](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microvision-inc-announces-progress-automotive-210500945.html).

>We expect our 1st generation LRL Sensor to have range of at least 250 meters and the highest resolution at range of any lidar with 340 vertical lines up to 250 meters, 568 vertical lines up to 120 meters and 944 vertical lines up to 60 meters. This **equates** **to** 520 points per square degree.

(For those who read the math on LAZR, notice he doesn't say **up to**)

It testing is successful, the 1st Generation LRL Sensor will be able to calculate velocity of objects relative to itself, and be able to be used in Level 3 and Level 4 self-driving applications

>Our LRL Sensor will also output velocity of moving objects relative to an ego vehicle across our dynamic field of view in real-time 30 Hz sensor output. This sensor would accelerate development of Level 3 (L3) autonomous safety and Level 4 (L4) autonomous driving features that are important to potential customers and interested parties.

What is Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving?

Level 1 is feet off, level 2 is hands off, level 3 is eyes off, level 4 is mind off, and level 5 is full passenger (you can sit in the back). So basically, they have that 2045 technology **today**, while everyone else is trying to play catch-up. How is it so advanced? It all lies in the high resolution of the laser sensors.

If their devices can really recognize people, objects, and pets, it could integrate security verticals in MicroVision's business model. ([Video surveillance is expected to reach a 144.5 B market size by 2027](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/video-surveillance-market-size-is-expected-to-reach-usd-144-85-billion-by-2027---valuates-reports-301056561.html#:~:text=The%20global%20IP%20video%20surveillance,CAGR%20from%202019%20to%202026)) Why not just use cameras?[ Cameras are worse at long distances](https://www.techbriefs.com/component/content/article/tb/stories/blog/37699),

**Growing Industry**

The self-driving cars market[ is expected to reach 220.44 billion](https://www.marketdataforecast.com/market-reports/self-driving-cars-market) dollars by 2025. This includes taxi, civil, public transport, heavy duty trucks, ride shares, and ride hail (UBER - 72 B mkt cap) applications.

Traffic Accidents ***in the US alone*** [Cost 871 Billion A Year](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/motor-vehicle-crashes-u-s-cost-871-billion-year-federal-study-finds#:~:text=federal%2Dstudy%2Dfinds-,Traffic%20accidents%20in%20the%20U.S.%20cost,a%20year%2C%20federal%20study%20finds&text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%94%20The%20economic%20and%20societal,National%20Highway%20Traffic%20Safety%20Administration), even just yesterday there was an[ insane pileup](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/traffic/traffic-updates-overnight-sleet-turns-north-texas-roads-into-sheets-of-ice/2548822/) on the I-35W highway in Texas that killed 6, injured 36, and damaged 133 vehicles.

Not only self-driven cars need LiDAR. In a few years, as soon as MicroVision's 1st Gen LRL is available, LiDAR systems will certainly become mandatory for (still) human-controlled cars to avoid collisions. This tech could become as revolutionary and successful as airbags.[ Airbags are a 37.3 billion dollar industry](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/airbag-market#:~:text=Global%20Airbag%20Market%20is%20expected,and%20deflate%20after%20the%20accident).

If only 10% of the[ cars produced](https://www.statista.com/statistics/262747/worldwide-automobile-production-since-2000/) annually contain four Microvision LRL systems, this will result in a volume of 364 million units in ten years. (9.1 million cars \* 4 modules \* 10 years) And this is a conservative calculation, both a higher market share, more cars produced, and more modules per car are conceivable.

Whoever has the MicroVision technology may be able to eliminate the competition or demand license fees from them. Or the other way around: Whoever does not buy the technology can be excluded from markets. Therefore, bidding competition may arise to gain access to the market. Whoever has the best LiDAR system for cars will also be able to supply other components and software to car manufacturers. The car manufacturer who has the best LiDAR system has a big advantage over the competition.

MicroVision offers a quantitatively much higher performance product than both of its competitor companies. Because of their lack of focus on augmented reality technologies, competitors are not likely to have a future in the markets of smart glasses, healthcare, engineering, military equipment, GPS safety, entertainment, and interactive projectors. They are involved in an industry that is currently at an inflection point, due to grow massively in the near future. Their high number of extremely advanced patents will bring in significant revenue for the company in the coming years. I have never seen a company with such low insider selling, that the last case of a sale was in 2014. Institutional investors are piling in as MicroVision's balance sheet improves and they near the April LRL sensor test date, which has a high likelihood of being a success.

115,PM (don’t @ me I know) and the Tar Train to Tendie Town,15,0.63,pjorgypjorg,"# Introduction:
With the exception of possibly fracking you won’t find an industry that’s more frowned upon than big Tobacco. And yes I know Phillip Morris cigarettes personally jumped through the window and murdered your nana or something (the jury is still out on the whole “science” thing I’m fairly certain). 
# But wait! You say. Aren’t cigarettes a dying industry? 
Yes, yes they are now shut the fuck up and strap your helmets on while I explain the three reasons why that’s ok: 

> 1). You know what I like to do when I’m out at a bar? (Other than getting blackout drunk and trying to convince people I’m the bastard son of Nikki Sixx). That’s right, buy an overpriced pack of cancer sticks and smoke every fuckin’ one of them. So when the hip youth finally get out of lock down and head back to the club who’s coming with them? *Ding* *Ding* It’s motherfuckin’ Camel Joe and the Marlboro Kid —or whatever the fuck wacky mascot institutional cancer has these days.
 
> 2). Smokeless tobacco/vaping/boofing pipe tobacco, doesn’t have the same negative sentiment as smoking, approximately everyone under the age of 25 (I can’t count fuck off) has developed a vape habit while you’ve been watching the PLTR ticker and if you think the biggest players in the nicotine game aren’t getting a piece of that I have a bridge in New York to sell you. I’m not gonna weigh in on if that’s actually any better for you because —again, not a doctor and for all I know vape fever is gonna cause everyone’s dicks to fly off and their eyes to explode. But I believe that even a micrometer of positive public sentiment would drive investor confidence higher than your moms libido (ok, probably not that high, but you get my drift). 
  
> 3). Marijuana. This elephant has been in the room for a long damn time, and is pure speculation but if I was a floundering tobacco giant trying to stay relevant I know what industry I’d diversify into. And unlike many popular marijuana stocks this company actually has *money* which is — I’ve been told, fairly important to running a business. 

# FINANCIALS: or, how I learned to stop worrying and love the stock: 

I’m not going to beat around the bush here, the glory days are gone for PM, all the 🌈🐻 laws have stopped inter-office smoking parties, you can’t smoke in the McDonalds play area, it’s rough. But what’s this? A positive EPS? Why yes yes it is. And the tobacco packaging industry [is projected to grow ](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/tobacco-packaging-market-to-2030-projected-for-healthy-growth-rate-by-marketresearchbiz-amcor-limited-innovia-films-ltd-2021-02-12) healthily into 2030. PM is currently trading at a P/E of 16.21 which is less than MO (90) or UVV(21.8) but higher than BTI (10.9) 
It also pays something called a “DIVY-den” of ~5.6% I’m not a boomer 🌈🐻 but I think this is some kind of house (den= house for 🐻) that you count money in (Divy= old fashioned pirate term for counting or dividing loot), unfortunately you can only get these weird bear-houses when you buy these boomer options called “chairs” that never expire (?) even after more than TWO weeks (crazy I know). 

# My bet/ positions: 
 
I think that not only will tobacco retail see a decent pop post COVID, they are positioned to capitalize on the federal legalization of marijuana we’re all so fond of jerking off over. In fact I believe PM may be better positioned than some marijuana specific companies (this is highly speculative). Additionally while global smoking rates are decreasing,  there is still a growing market share in [certain ](https://tobaccoatlas.org/topic/consumption/) countries. I’m not balls deep in this trade yet but will be executing it on Tuesday at open and will update afterwards
# THIS POST IS NOT “ADVICE” FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE AND THE AUTHOR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF ANYONE (even himself).

Positions I plan to add:
PM 9/17/21 $75c @12.55
PM 1/21/22 $75c @13.10 

Sell PM 2/19/21 84p @0.21

Edit: I gotta add that these absolute mad lads have managed to INCREASE revenues on a DECREASE in sales because once you go black (lung) you never go back. They also already own a cannabis company: CRON —so there’s that.
There are only two things I’ve never been able to quit: smoking, gambling, and your mom (transcribers note: this is more than two things but my client was very insistent that “ numbers don’t even go that high” and that “no one actually knows how to read”)Take from that what you will.
Based on some new info I’ve seen MO may be better positioned in the space due to magic numbers making their P/E better than it appears.

116,I sharpened my crayon set for this NOK dd....I hope you enjoy,493,0.89,clash_jeremy,"I was in NOK before the craziness of a couple weeks ago. I still am, and have been accumulating under $5 pretty heavily. Average is right around $4.50.

Disclaimer: I own 2500 shares of NOK, and 65 Jan 2022 $10C.

I am fully aware that P/E valuation isn't the best method of valuation for a stock, but I did some rough math to set a PT for myself. I'm very long on this stock, and I don't foresee myself selling a majority of my position anytime in the life cycle of 5G networks. Anyway, in my math, I realized a wild undervaluation IMO on NOK.

***P/E Breakdown*** *(these numbers are a bit old as I did the math earlier this week, and my first attempt to post this got removed for some reason)*

Currently NOK has a P/E ratio of just under 14 (it got down to just above 13 at it's low on Thursday)

* The most applicable comparator stock we can us is ERIC which has a PE of 20.29
* The telecom provider industry as a whole has a PE of 21.26
* Trailing EPS is .31, and this is where it gets a bit interesting. Their previous ER yielded an EPS of .17. The previous CEO instilled a methodology to increase profitability and free cash flow, and the current CEO has been pursuing that relentlessly. These efforts were yielding results even in the midst of COVID.
* If you forecast out a moderate EPS of .17 for the next 3 quarters and keep the PE the same. The stock price would be... **$9.52.** I'm aware that they may not achieve this amount of EPS per ER going forward, but I think that is a decent (perhaps conservative) baseline to operate off of.
* One gap I see that the market is missing on the entire industry is giving it a very conservative outlook. As 5G networks mature and transition into 6G and beyond, the opportunities for steady cash flow and increasing margins and revenue will abound in this industry. Going forward, I feel that a ratio of 25 applied to the industry NOK operates in would be appropriate (and again...perhaps conservative). For reference, Apple's current PE is 37 and AMD's is 82. Not good comparators, but everyone knows these companies and what they do, so they can draw their own conclusion.
* If we were to apply the conservative .17 EPS x 4 and the new industry wide PE to NOK stock, we would yield a PT of... **$17**

**2 Things that could change the equation in a hurry**

**#1 - Reinstate Dividends**

In their previous ER, they said they would give an update on their dividend reinstatement by March 18th (when they hold their annual ""Capital Markets Day"" event). I'm on WSB, so you know I'm a betting man, and if there were a place to wager if they were or were not going to reinstate dividends, I would be all in on that they are going to reinstate. They stopped dividends to pump up R&D into 5G (and probably 6G) and to increase FCF.

If they do reinstate dividends, just on a cursory glance of an ETF database, there is close to $2.5B AUM in EU Dividend focused ETFs. I would assume a large number of these ETFs would pick up NOK, and if they are market cap weighed, they will pick it up heftily. I'm sure there are a number of US based ETFs with a dividend focus that would add NOK as well.

This accumulation would definitely kick start a movement in the price, and could change the way boomers/HFs view NOK.

**#2 - Infrastructure Stimulus**

There is no doubt that some massive stimulus packages in the EU/US will be passed at some point this year...on top of the $1.9T that is currently in process. Both the Biden administration and the ECB chair (Christine Lagarde) are big fans of infrastructure stimulus. 5G is literally mentioned on the Biden website...[https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/)

In the time since trying to post this and now, this article came out about Biden/China/infrastructure. Remember, when Biden says infrastructure, 5G is a big part of that.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56036245](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56036245)

In a time where such data intensive processes are on the forefront of the economy (transition to ""alternative currencies"", autonomous cars, etc.) there will be a desire to invest heavily into networks that can meet those data demands. There has been no signal that the US is going to pivot away from the Huawei ban, giving NOK and other companies a chance to pick up huge swaths of market share...

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/biden-commerce-pick-sees-no-reason-to-pull-huawei-from-blacklist](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/biden-commerce-pick-sees-no-reason-to-pull-huawei-from-blacklist)

That should give you comfort that NOK's ability to compete and be an ""oligopoly-esque"" player in mobile networks going forward in the US. On top of that, Nokia was chosen to lead the EU's project researching 6G networks....

117,"NOK NOK, WHOSE THERE?",597,0.84,TheAngryItalianMan,"**Current Status Report:**

* Nokia has benefited largely from the ban of Huawei and ZTE due to them being targeted by Trump during his anti-China campaign. Nokia has since netted around 40%-50% of these outstanding contracts due to the absence of these prior competitors.

* Nokia fumbled early entry into the 5G space because of a bloated and expensive product line. This is now all changing and ReefShark (management's answer to this mistake) is now taking off. ReefShark is a new chipset and subsequent product line that promises better margins for the company. 75% rollout by EOY 2021. 100% by EOY 2022.

* The new CEO as of last August is Pekka Lundmark. This man has demonstrated incredible financial responsibility and a very disciplined leadership modality. He is significantly more competent than the last CEO, Rajeev Suri, meaning the company's future is probably stable for now. Unfortunately, Pekka is also an old dog, you should not expect him to make any exciting or ambitious plays anytime soon.

* There is some price erosion in the North American market, meaning that there are currently bidding wars going on here - leading to reduced margins for Nokia. In addition, the U.S. dollar is also dropping compared to the Euro, thanks to free money from the federal reserve - leading to reduced top line figures for Nokia. Every other market has remained relatively stable.

**The Bull Case:**

* ReefShark is mostly coming online by EOY 2021. This has potential to kickstart a significant bull run for Nokia OYJ.

* Nokia OYJ is a profitable company, a rare thing in this economy of overinflated tech stocks and overly optimistic COVID recovery plays.

* Nokia OYJ has a solid balance sheet that consists of more than $10-$12 billion dollars of liquid assets (e.i. cash/short term investments). Half the company's net worth is basically in cash.

* Nokia OYJ (NOK) 23.67B is significantly undervalued compared to relevant competitors such as Cisco Systems (CSCO) 199.61B and Ericsson Systems (ERIC) 41.94B despite having a sizable market share in one of the world's most important tech markets - 5G communications is set to skyrocket due to higher demand via IOT and next-gen technologies such as self-driving cars.

* Nokia OYJ is worth only about 60% of Ericsson Systems despite having nearly identical balance sheets and income statements. Ericsson indeed has a lead on Nokia in terms of profitability margins and secured contracts - but the importance of both is overstated without context. Increased profits of a few hundred million when you are dealing with tens of billions in overall revenue is an absolute joke. As for the additional 5G deals Ericsson has, Ericsson is agreeing to them at a loss - in hopes that they will be a loss leader in order to secure and lock down clients to their tech stack. Again, maybe, but ever since the banning of Huawei and ZTE, clients have insisted on more and more flexibility in terms of cloud service alternatives - thereby negating any ""early bird"" advantage.

* Nokia OYJ is important politically, financially, and strategically to Europe and North American interests. You can expect help from politicians in the future.

* Nokia OYJ is already at the very bottom. At $4 per share, this company is trading as if it were in the same industry as hot dog vendors in terms of cash flow and price to earnings. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that at $3 - $3.5 per share, Nokia had to take actions to prevent itself from being bought outright in a hostile takeover bid.

* Nokia OYJ has one of the highest number of outstanding option contracts in the entire market. This has the potential to lead to some very funky market-driven events such as the company hitting $9.75 per share on January 27th 2021.

* Prominent hedge funds were holding major positions in this stock at $4 per share at the end of December. Have they sold already during last week's high? Who knows? But what it tells us was that even without that weird peak on January 27th, hedge funds felt that $4 per share was an absolute bargain.

**The Bear Case:**

* Nokia is in a highly competitive market with low margins. Even with Huawei and ZTE out of the picture, Samsung poses a significant risk as the Korean conglomerate can easily undercut Nokia's margins. Samsung unlikely to be met with the same restrictions due to South Korea's diplomatic ties with North America and Europe.

* Nokia is late to the game of 5G with their earlier fumble under the mired leadership of Rajeev Suri. Why bet on the underdog when you can bet on the incumbent that is Ericsson?

* By investing in Nokia, you might be losing out on better investment opportunities that have been severely discounted due to COVID-19. 

**Summary Recommendations:**

**If you are bullish)** Buy more and hold. You currently own a safe haven asset that is unlikely to be affected by further market downturns related to COVID-19. Unemployment is still sky high and the rest of the market hasn't realized the consequences of this yet.

**If you are bearish)** Hold until at least March or April. Recent sell off is the market reacting irrationally to Pekka Lundmark saying the forbidden words of ""price erosion"" and ""difficult year"" in the same sentence - even though the fault of this is largely due to American companies engaging in bidding wars and the U.S. dollar shorting itself into the ground. All in all the earnings report was still good and I expect a rebound.

**Important Disclaimer:** 

NOK is a relatively safe investment, not necessarily a good one. If you find a better opportunity in another stock while waiting for NOK to moon - don't be afraid to take it. Do not get sucked into sunk cost fallacy if you bought in at a high price.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljdboy/nok_nok_whose_there/,1613291825.0

This is the 2nd or 3rd time I'm posting about the sexiest stonk out there right now in my opinion.

Stonk is called Frequency Therapeutics and Barry loves this stonk (proof below)

This is still the ground floor (1.7bn ish market cap) of a company that seems to be far along in the Progenitor Cell activation. Their first endeavor is solving hearing loss for which there are no good alternatives right now (hearing aids dont work for shi) followed by MS. For all you bald aholes out there, don't worry, they will eventually get to you once they solved real issues.

They have an allstar cast at the company including Dr.Langer who is one of the most accomplished scientists in the US. 

My 98% of my portfolio overweight in this bad boy and I believe it's going to be a double win. I'm more interested in them restoring the lives of people truly struggling with hearing loss and tinnitus but I'm also interested in making tendies so that with my new and improved hearing, I can listen to my wife being taken care of by her boyfriend.

TLDR: I like this stonk. Barry likes this stonk. it's a FREQ

At most the retail can bring the price up like $5 judging by the price action last week. And the shorts have been fucking with options for 2 fucking weeks because they can't do anything with dried up shares.

Only way to fuck shorts now with retail buying power?

OPTIONS.

That's why I sold half of my shares and bought FD(options expiring very soon) CALLS

Go to [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) if you want to hold your fucking shares

We initially started to have explosive price actions at +$70 and $100.

That's because there was a fuckt ton of demand in OTM call options for GME. about 100k+ in OTM CALL options.

Don't know what gamma squeeze or options are? Let me give you a ELI5 version

Gamma squeeze = big money buying a shit ton of shares to cover their asses from selling call options to you.

Call options = you make x10 more of your money than holding shares but higher risks are involved.

Basically the more call options we hold the more MMs will have to buy up already dried up shares.

If you have no idea about options watch this video /watch?v=CRhGikRHSu8 and educate yourself. You will become very rich if you play it right.

I’ll keep this short and sweet for you retards and I encourage you to do your own DD as I just want to get the word out there with this post:

**G1 Therapeutics ($GTHX)** is a biopharmaceutical company developing some really fucking innovative drugs for cancer treatment. This isn’t two cross-eyed joe-schmoes in their garage getting government funding to shake up some test tubes of their own piss, they’re actually getting shit done.

This drug is going to start being distributed in *less than a month*, their earnings report is at the end of this month, and if their breast cancer drug ends up getting approved in a few months as well, I think we are going to see an even bigger boom than what I’m expecting on Tuesday. Did I mention they’re up 145% in the last three months, and nearly 65% in the last month alone? 
  
I’m expecting big things from $GTHX and encourage others to do their own research and see if they’re seeing the same thing I am: major potential. This is now my biggest position and I’m excited to see what comes next for them.

The skouries project  was brought to a halt mainly for environmental reasons and opposition from the previous government.

EGO is undervalued and currently trading at 13 dollars.

Although EGO performed well during 2020, it has underperformed since 2017. GDX has been up 167% while EGO has is sitting at the same price compared to 4 years ago.

A recent agreement was signed with the greek government week before last that renewed the contract for the skouries and olympias project. This caused the stock price to only jump roughly 12%. When the contract was suspended in 2015, there was a 50% drop.

What's the play here? In the next three weeks the new contract will pass through the greek parliament.  If it is indeed ratified, then I do expect a run to 20 fairly soon.  The positive sentiment for metals helps as well.

Why is this important? Tesla continues to dominate every sector of the EV market. If VW can’t sell the ID3, then who the fuck has a prayer of competing? 

Every car Tesla sells is another candidate for Fsd take (100% profit margin), premium connectivity, Tesla insurance, and future entertainment options. FSD and insurance are going to be paired— use of the former will reduce the cost of the latter, providing a massive incentive to go all in

TLDR

Diamond hand those shares no matter what happens. Nobody enters the hall of the gods and feasts until the end of time unless they die with their Tesla shares in their hand.

124,Upcoming Week 2/19 Geee Em Eeee ITM Options Targets: Playing The Market Fuckery... Pt. 2...,4192,0.95,misium500," Well, as I predicted, they kept the price over $50 so that the stack of 10,000 (yes, ten thousand options) Put contracts didn't get executed. That tells me that they aren't just tanking the price, and that they are playing the options spread at the moment.

It also tells me that they are scared shitless of shares needing to be delivered and taken off of the open market. They'd rather keep the price boosted over $50 to stop delivery than to risk an extra 1,000,000 shares getting into long hands.

But, thankfully, that also let's us know that they're still playing the game. If they were giving up and going into all-or-nothing mode, they wouldn't give a shit about the deliveries. They'd either flood the market with 25,000,000 FTDs while tanking the price to cover at $20 while hoping they have enough left over for the fines... Or they'd cash out what they have left now and file for bankruptcy while leaving the clearing houses to pay the bad debt.

No, they're still planning on finding the cheapest way out of this without any (or minimal) legal trouble. That means we're still getting paid. (Eventually...)

I've been watching this for a while now, and I think I've gotten a hand on what they are doing. This coming week will be the tell-all... And I'm going to explain why I believe the price can only go up...

So. Let's crunch the 2/19 option chain and see where this train is headed... - This Week, oooon Gaaaaaame Theeeeory!... *queue intro music*...

Current price $52:

Put ITM: 59,434

Put OTM: 346,288

Call ITM: 29,930

Call OTM: 87,111

At Current Price, a total of 89,364 option contracts are ITM.

Now, let's look at possible price movement. See, they are keeping Gee em eee at the line of demarcation between the single-dollar price change contracts ($41-$42-$43-et al.)... And the five-dollar price change per contract ($50-$55-$60-et al.)

That means that for every dollar that the stock drops, it executes a new Put option contract... But it would need to climb five dollars to execute a new call option. That's why I told you in the last thread that they are playing between the $50-$54.99 range all week.

See, because of the contract price structuring, it actually costs them MORE to knock the price down any lower. Allow me to explain:

Lets look at both the Call and Put sides of the option chain... And for the nearest $10 swing in prices...

There are 29,337 Put Options for $40-$50 strike.

There are 2,459 Put Options for $51-$59 strike.

There are 13,187 Call Options for $40-$50 strike.

There are 3,066 Call Options for $51-$59 strike.

Now, lemme explain why I believe this matters in predicting where the price is going to drift this week.

If the price were to drop by $10, the net difference would be an ADDITIONAL 16,150 options that would be executed because of the contract price structuring. 10 Put Options would become in the money.

Conversely, if the price went UP by $9, the net difference would be 507 extra contracts that would be able to be executed. Because of the price structuring, only two new Call Option strikes would be able to be executed between $55-$59.

If we were to just look at the next five Put Option contracts below the current strike price, it equals up to 22,175. That means if the price were to DROP $5, they would need to find delivery for an EXTRA 2,217,500 shares.

If the price were to go UP by $5, they would only need to find 85,600 extra shares to cover the extra contracts that would be ITM at $55.

Let me say that again. If the price goes DOWN... It takes MORE shares off the market because of the Put Options going in dollar increments, while the Call Options go up in $5 increments.

It is also interesting to note that ending the week at $59 would cause less deliveries than ending at $55.

My hypothesis: They can't hold the price at $50 this upcoming week simply due to the lack of shares available and the buyer demand staying so consistent. We only had 12mil-13mil volume the last two days. The shares are drying up.

So if they can't hold the price steady, they need to decide which direction to move it. And based on the math, moving the price UP would save the shorts money by causing the lesser of two evils in extra deliveries.

But one thing is for sure. They can't let the price tank any lower this upcoming week. It would trigger too many new deliveries.

(There's actually some serious game theory that says the best move to trigger the squeeze would be for us to ALLOW the price to drop to exactly $39.99 at close of next week... as odd as that seems)

So what's my non-financially-advising-crystal-ball predict that this weeks close will be on 2/19?...

$58.47...

They are going to allow some big single-day swings Tuesday and Wednesday to send the stock price from $52 up to tickle the $60 mark so that they can go balls-deep selling $60C Premium... And then they will hold the price just below the line.

The next target after that would be $69 (giggity), as there is a large off-set of Calls vs Puts at $70 that would cause the delivery equilibrium to start going net positive again. I just don't think they're going to let us get $19 in a single week, as that would cause retail investor interest to start going up again.

Tl;dr: We end next week at $58-$59 and the slow bleeding continues until the week of Feb 26.

I'll be back when I finish another model I'm working on...

125,Akamai Technologies Bullish Thesis,13,0.65,jejakqmqm,"Shares of the CDN and cloud security company have dipped about 20% from its January 27th high of $121/share following weaker than expected guidance for 2021 (forecasting 6% growth in revenue).

When I saw that growth estimate I immediately thought they were sand bagging. All of their segments except the web division saw double digit growth in 2020. The first question on the latest analyst call asked why they were forecasting low growth and their CFO said it was due to expectations that their customers in the travel and hospitality division were asking for extended payment terms. I get the concern but that still doesn’t indicate there are any types of default/missed payments looming on the horizon. That sector will make a comeback.

Akamai continues to see a ton of growth in their cybersecurity segment which exceeded $1 billion in revenue for 2020, or 25% YoY growth. Media and carrier division was up 15% YoY. That makes up more than 60% of their revenue. 

I understand Fastly and Cloudfare are taking market share and growing at ridiculous 40-50% comps but to me both are getting a little bit overvalued and that was evident following NET’s drop after earnings. Same will likely happen to Fastly next week when they report.

Overall, this looks like a solid value play with Akamai currently trading at 11x EV/EBITDA for the next 12 months. Historically it trades closer to 15x which would put it around $120/share.

Made a quick analysis between the companies factoring in growth and EV for 2021. The lower EV/Sales to growth, the better.

EV/Sales to Growth
AKAM: 0.76
NET: 1.10
FSLY: 0.95


Would love to hear insight from those in the industry! Not really talked about much on investing forums. Seems like most people think AKAM is a legacy/boomer company and that’s why I am a bit hesitant to invest.

I'll keep my DD short.

They make:

- Silicon wafers and other materials required to produce microchips and memory
- Equipment for chips manufacturing
- Everything for LCD and OLED displays manufacturing
- Materials for photovoltaic solar panels production

Their biggest customers are:

- TSM (currently building a new factory in the US, and boy it will need a lot of equipment and materials and guess who is gonna supply most of it)
- Samsung (considering building a factory in the US too, if that comes through - massive revenue point for AMAT)
- Intel
- SK Hynix 


**So basically if semiconductor manufacturers are printing money right now (and probably will throughout the whole year) - AMAT supplies them with paper, ink and printers.**

If you're bullish on any of the big semiconductor stocks - you should be bullish on AMAT too, except for it has more reasonable valuation and significantly less exposed to major risks.

128,"Intel's hidden gem, Mobileye",40,0.64,tecladovoador,"Yesterday I put out my first DD piece on Intel, the most undervalued high cap company in the US stock market. Of course it left a sour but familiar taste in the mouths of Lisa Su's cuck army and AMD fanboys. Today I'm here with another treat for you, don't be shy I know deep down you like it.

Honestly Intel has so many juicy bits of DD to squeeze out its hard to pick where to start.

Nevertheless I know you are hungry so Ill start with an appetizer.

Mobileye

Don't be fooled, If Mobileye was an independent company it would probably be you guys' main dish and desert after it had been pumped to a 100B market cap like many of the ""tech of the future"" sector stocks. The reality is, Mobileye is the future and the 100B market cap would probably not be that outlandish in this market. One word:

Autonomous vehicles.

That's right, a market that is in its most infant state but that has the potential to be bigger than the United Kingdoms economy by 2030.

Don't take it from me ""The market is then expected to recover and grow at a CAGR of 12.7% from 2021 ad reach $1,191.8 billion in 2023. The market is expected to reach $1,642.9 billion in 2025 growing at a CAGR of 17.4%, and $3,195.0 billion in 2030 growing at a CAGR of 14.2%. ""1\*

Mobileye is one of the leaders in the autonomous vehicle industry and is poised not just to grow in market share but to take over. Last year they brought in for Intel a cool Billion, yeah I know its nothing much, its just double AMDs net earnings last quarter and about 1 and a bit% of Intel's annual revenues. Oh yeah I know you must be seething at the way I am phrasing this.

Professor Amnon Shashua (CEO of Mobileye) who you will be calling Daddy very soon when your asymmetric relationship with Su Bae doesn't work out had some interesting things to say this year, "" Despite unprecedented challenges to the auto industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we secured more than 37 new design wins, including deals with major OEMs such as Geely and Ford. We are currently active in 49 production programs1  across over 25 OEMs.""

Intel also acquired Moovit to facilitate Mobileyes dominance, ""We acquired Moovit to accelerate Mobileye's MaaS offering. Moovit is known for its urban mobility application and brings Mobileye closer to achieving our plan to become a complete mobility provider, including robotaxi services.""

Fuck Tesla fake autonomous driving program, when the robo taxis do come they will have mobileye in them.

Intel bought Mobileye for 15.3 Billion $ in March 2017 when they were at the start of a year that brought them 200 million $ in revenue. You see what I mean when I say this could be valued at 100B in market cap given the current market (Its a type of bubble(might not pop but its still a bubble), IDGAF what you say).

But Intel's market cap is only 250B? What's going on here Mr Market? Have you been eating crayons? Its alright, a little nudge and you will wake up.

By buying Intel you are in effect able to buy a stake in the future of autonomous vehicles at tremendous discount.

Like I said, this is just a little treat. Intel is a full meal and it has a lot to give.

1700 INTC shares, 500 April 16th 80$ strike calls and yesterday before close I added a little 50 Feb 26th 65$ strikes for good measure. Your wife's boyfriend is counting on you to be smart and buy Intel calls or you wont be able to subsidize their trip to the Maldives.

129,Why GameStop and Ryan Cohen will win. [DD] No Diamond Hands Required.,11104,0.91,Yonsei,"Alright apes and autists, let me explain why I believe GameStop has a strong fundamental case without mentioning diamond hands and short squeeze. If Ryan Cohen can successfully execute his vision, this leaky vessel will turn into a rocket ship blasting past the moon to the edge of the observable universe.

On November 16, 2020, Ryan Cohen sent a letter to the GameStop's Board of Directors titled ""Maximizing Stockholder Value by Becoming the Ultimate Destination for Gamers"". In it, Ryan Cohen outlined the roadmap for GameStop to pivot and become a technology first company. Let me boil this down for you in simple language for you smooth brain apes.

**The Mission Statement**

""GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences \[...\] the successful and durable players of tomorrow will be technology-first companies that specialize in gaming products, experiences and services.""

**The Landscape**

* Explosive Growth in the Gaming Industry
   * ""The size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle.""
   * ""The global gaming market expected to be $174.9 billion this year and reach $217.9 billion by 2023.""
* Valuable Assets
   * Existing ""strong brand"" and recent Reddit frenzy is net positive to the brand, increases awareness, and strengthens its base.
   * ""Large customer base and 55 million PowerUp members.""
   * Large retail and physical footprint.

**The Roadmap**

* Evolve into a Technology-first company
   * ""Technology is changing nearly every aspect of the gaming world, ranging from the way gamers shop to how they interact and compete with one another.""
   * GameStop will have to ""begin building a powerful e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high-touch experience that excites and delights customers."" (Ryan successfully executed this vision with Chewy and he can do it again in gaming)
   * GameStop will have to ""hire the right talent."" (So far, Ryan has recruited 5 rock stars from Chewy and Amazon to join the team, more on that later).
* Create the Ultimate Gaming Platform
   * ""Shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors."" (Create a marketplace of wanted products and services, i.e. Amazon, Target, App Store)
   * Provide and expand ""larger gaming catalogs"" (Capture all games)
   * Create ""community experiences"" (This could be both physical and digital experiences)
   * Provide ""streaming services"" (New vertical opportunity for content creation, tournaments, and others)
   * Support ""Esports"" (Expanding scene that is not going away)
* Transition to Digital
   * ""Industry developments in recent years"" include ""transition from physical hardware to digital streaming"" and the ""explosion of mobile.""
   * Expand ""digital content."" (This needs to be a focus as it's competing against Steam, Blizzard, App Store, etc)
   * Allow ""online trade-ins."" (This would be a game changer)
* Cut Excessive costs
   * ""Cut its excessive real estate costs"" and ""identify duplicative, under performing stores and plan to forgo lease renewals.""
   * Streamline ""Non-core operations in Europe and Australia \[...\] in order to reduce losses and potentially generate cash.""
   * ""Near-term increases in cash flow stemming from the console cycle can also help finance the future.""

**The Financials**

Analysts are valuing GameStop as a traditional brick-and-mortar business. If Ryan can properly execute and transform the company, I believe they can become the Target and Chewy of Gaming with potential verticals of streaming and Esports (not factored into this calculation for now). GameStop makes roughly $8 Billion in Revenue, however it is currently valued at a $3.5B Market Cap as it bleeds cash. Target makes roughly $78B in Revenue with $3.3B in Net Income and a Market Cap of $96 Billion. Chewy makes roughly $4.8B in Revenue, losing money but growing quickly, and is valued at $44B in Market Cap. Target and Chewy are valued at 1.25x to 9x Price to Sales respectively. This equates to $10B to $72B Market Cap transposed to GameStop. Obviously, this is very simplistic and does not consider their balance sheet and other factors, but given these metrics:

* GameStop stock price potential is between $143 to $1,032 a share based on a current revenues.

Note this is assuming $8B in Revenue. If GameStop can grow revenues, focus on digital to improve margins, and expand within the growing total addressable market, I see potential for higher prices and achieving Target to Chewy-like multiples.

**The X Factor**

I believe Ryan Cohen was offered to lead GameStop's transition with significant control and autonomy. Otherwise, I do not believe he would have joined the Board. In his letter, Ryan simply stated that ""RC Ventures is not interested in receiving a lone seat on GameStop's ten-member Board. It is not enticing to become an isolated stockholder advocate on a Board that has overlooked years of digital revenue opportunities and presided over massive value destruction without assuming full accountability."" With the recent additions of two Chewy Executives to the Board of Directors, a new Chief Technology Officer who was the Engineering Lead in Amazon Web Services, a new Customer Care Executive from Chewy, and a new Fulfillment Executive from Amazon, I believe Ryan is executing his vision and revamping the GameStop team.

Notice his hires are from Chewy and Amazon? Ryan Cohen was obsessed with Amazon’s customer centric philosophy and built Chewy to follow that same model. He is hiring digital and e-commerce focused leaders to manage this transformation. Ryan's customer centric obsession is what allowed Chewy to beat Amazon. If GameStop pivots to digital and follows that same obsession, this will be a great opportunity to win.

Furthermore, I believe Ryan's vision is the right roadmap for GameStop. Digital e-commerce, streaming, and mobile is the future and Ryan fully acknowledges and embraces that future. GameStop will need to revamp and modernize their website and phone app, but I am sure that will follow in the months ahead. GameStop has the financial and brand assets that should weather this storm, but execution will be key. Ryan owns nearly 10% of GameStop, so he has a vested interest in its success and has much more to lose than my stake.

So degens, I say think with your heart and not with your smooth brain. Strap in and sit tight, this rocket ship may turn into a long journey to Mars. Maybe Papa Elon will be our catalyst.

P.S. If we all buy something from GameStop this quarter we can load this rocket ship ourselves.

**I) The Short Interest Numbers**

Short interest (""SI"") is calculated by shares shorted over total outstanding shares. *See* [*https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterest.asp)*;* [*https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/shortedstock.asp*](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/shortedstock.asp)*.* Apparently other firms have used different versions of float. All other forms of float are likely incorrect, and not likely used by Finra. **This is an important assumption** \- if I am wrong here, then fuck.

**Edit** (to above): People are suggesting my float is wrong. That is exactly my point. I am using float as outstanding shares b/c we don't know what it is. If someone actually knows the float used by FINRA, post it; this post is then useless. The math working backwards from 226% is fair game, however. That's why it's possible I'm wrong (*see* [*https://www.highshortinterest.com/*](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)*)*. *See also* comment by [JeanGuyRubberboots](https://www.reddit.com/user/JeanGuyRubberboots/) below (ctrl+f). *Either way, it's remarkable that $GME on some sources is still the most shorted stock.* I want to see the actual float used by FINRA. Until then, here's the math based on the SI equation.

Total outstanding shares of GME is 69.75 million. *See* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/).

Finra SI of GME is .78 as of January 27th. *See* [*http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0*](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.58.0).

.78\*69.75 million = 54.405m. Thus, 54.045m million shares are short GME of January 27th.

To calculate real SI, we remove insider ownership. **Another big assumption**. Insider ownership stands at 19.06m. *See* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/insider-transactions/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/insider-transactions/).

Thus, free float is outstanding shares *less* insider ownership shares. 50,750,000 shares.

**Real SI appears, at minimum, 1.07 (54.405m/50.750m).**

\----

**II) The Shorts Remaining and Covered**

On January 15th, GME SI stood at 121%. *See* [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-these-the-best-heavily-shorted-stocks-to-buy-right-now-5-names-to-watch-2021-01-31](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-these-the-best-heavily-shorted-stocks-to-buy-right-now-5-names-to-watch-2021-01-31).

Thus, from January 15th to the 27th, we know at least 84.397m shares were shorted. (1.21\*outstanding shares).

By January 27th, 54.405m shorts remained (previous short amounts minus current shorts remaining as of 1.27). The number of shorts that covered from Jan. 15th to the 27th was was 29.992m. 29.992m/84.397m shares = \~35%. Thus, 65% of shorts pre-squeeze remain, owing APR.

Around \~35% of covering resulted in a 1,600% rise. Thus, a 65% cover rate (conservative) can yield a 2,971% rise. Let’s apply this math to now. From $50, this is a $1,485.50 GME price result. Could this happen? No idea. Notice the problem with this: I'm assuming *only* covering led to this rise. So this is simply a demonstrative point.

**New shorts from Jan. 27th to present likely opened at higher prices. 65% of those from $5, $10, $20, etc., probably remain. This is bad news for HF's.**

**III) The Effect**

Based on estimated remaining covers, price stagnation at $50 could result in further covering and collateral calls. This burden is reduced if HF's opened new shorts at the peak and they are substantially ITM. This part is unclear. We know it's very likely that HF's opened new shorts at the peak--- what isn't clear is that it was within their risk department's policy to open new shorts during a fucking squeeze. In my opinion, it wasn't until drops below <$200 the HF's felt safe opening up new shorts. This is a substantial point: if the new shorts are at much lower price points than thought, then the pain points for HF's are far lower. It's just unclear. Nonetheless, HF's may be bleeding substantially every week because of those remaining shorts.

A good counter is that borrow rates currently seem low for new positions. *See* [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME). You'd think these are correlated markets, so the most shorted stock on the market would have higher borrow rates. Borrow rates could be low because it's no longer shorted. Or because there is no volume on the stock. I'm not sure what borrow rates are for open short positions, but I imagine they're higher. I don't know more beyond this. Feel free to debate.

Moreover, consider the current liquidity and volume of $GME. It appears that retail buying power is spent. People either cashed out or are holding. So, they are unlikely to trigger the next squeeze - or a gamma one for that matter. Thus, the fighting grounds has likely gone institutional. Not all hedge funds are short $GME - nor are all financial whales. In my view, this has become an institutional fight, with both sides pointing the gun at each other, waiting who's going to pull the trigger first. Retail is simply on the sidelines, holding the clips in for both their guns (smirking, of course). How long until every chump with a few million bucks laying around realizes this is still the most shorted stock on the market before they infuse substantial buying pressure? Or I guess one Moby Dick will do it. My reservations in these predictions is that HF's are smart, they can't be fooled twice, etc., and all of that non-sense. But before intelligence comes greed. And I know greed and desperation has always governed the financial system.

**IV) Parting Thoughts**

It would take a half-brained monkey 45 seconds to crunch the short interest numbers. Yet Finra was late (posted after hours I think). This is the most shorted stock on the market according to my numbers - yet, again, **dead silence** from the mainstream media. Sources are using various versions of float to calculate SI, as if suddenly short interest is something that be manipulated based on our interests. Americans with $2,000\* in their checkings account are being investigated for stock fraud (that is, the general public and the focus doesn’t appear to be on hedge funds) and not the Big Money that loop-hole-engineered an illegal 140% naked short situation. *See* [https://fortune.com/2021/02/12/gme-gamestop-federal-probe-reddit-stocks-doj-justice-department-wallstreetbets-market-manipulation-amc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/12/gme-gamestop-federal-probe-reddit-stocks-doj-justice-department-wallstreetbets-market-manipulation-amc/); *see also* [http://www.firstamericanstock.com/index.php/articles/why-is-naked-short-selling-both-illegal-and-common-practice/](http://www.firstamericanstock.com/index.php/articles/why-is-naked-short-selling-both-illegal-and-common-practice/).

The Big Short is illustrative. It depicts how corruption and fraud has always been the building blocks of our financial institutions. Put differently, fraud doesn't just pervade the system - nay, it ***is*** the system. Everything I've seen *just doesn't feel right*. Understand at this point I'm speculating. But I trust my gut.

There are also posts suggesting OTM/ITM options are encouraging institutional price manipulations of $GME. This is beyond my knowledge span. However, if you looked at the bid-ask spreads this week of $GME, they were at times pennies apart for days. I've never seen that before. Seriously, **what the fuck.**

DFV is testifying alongside the CEO's of Robinhood, Citadel, and Melvin Capital. Next Thursday is a day to watch for me. Again $GME will be the most discussed and watched stock in America - and, arguably, the globe. Americans *and the world* will be reminded why their holdings in $GME tanked 50-90%. For many, their life savings. No, it wasn't a result of imprudent investments -- to invest money into a squeezing stock is a *good* idea short-term. It was the clearing houses pulling the plugs because *the financial system was never designed for working people to make that much money. So when the risk of you getting that rich increased, they stopped the game (pun intended)*. We don't even need to get into whether there was intentional collusion - that's just speculation, and it doesn't even matter to establish how messed up this is. But think of how this plays out: these institutions either bullshit their way through the hearing and everyone and their moms sees past it. Or they tell you the truth that, based on risk management and capital models, they never thought retail would get that rich that fast. Either way, I don't think it'll play out well for them other than DFV on national television. A key element to the public's reaction: AOC grilling the hell out of these folks. That will likely infuriate a lot of Americans watching.

And to set the record straight, I don't think retail is propping $GME at $50 because they have diamond hands -- middle America is holding because *they have nothing to lose* after the clearing houses and Robinhood tanked their portfolios by over half. **So their plan to kill off retail interest backfired.** In the process of stunting buying pressure, they inadvertently made chunks of working America diamond holders. Poetic justice - and fucking hilarious.

I'm not demonizing rich people. We all want financial freedom. I'm demonizing cheating the game. However this ends one thing is clear: The Big Squeeze is going to be an epic movie.

**TLDR: it's in the damn title.**

131,INTC is fundamentally undervalued. Short term Tendies are possible,98,0.73,Doubble3001,"# Let's get some facts down

Intel recently replaced its CEO with [Pat Gelsinger](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-appoints-tech-industry-leader-pat-gelsinger-as-new-ceo/). He worked at VMWare as their CEO and has worked at Intel when he was 18. Right now [Rocket lake](https://www.pcgamer.com/new-benchmarks-show-intel-rocket-lake-chips-leading-comet-lake-and-amd-zen-3-in-single-core/) is set to release soon. Based on the success of [Tiger lake](https://www.theverge.com/21440302/intel-tiger-lake-hands-on-tests-core-i7-1185g7-processor-release) this might put intel back into the game. They are also releasing [a GPU](https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-xe-hpg-tease-3dmark-mesh-shader/) soon. For more news like this, I would watch GamerNexus( Bot won't let me link it) who does really great reviews from the technical standpoint. They are planned to release 3nm and 5nm chips later this year or in 2022( They are just getting the contracts right now. No date yet). Also, they had an outstanding year despite losing their crown to $AMD back in Q4.

Just on their own their looking to bounce right back up from the pandemic. They still have some grow room from a lower revenue year. I bet this stock could go to $90 or even to $100 with rocket lake, and that's a short term gain meaning tendies in time for summer. But what about the long term or market correction.

# Data Analysis

|CompanyMarket|Market cap|Dividends /share price|Q4 '20 revenue|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$INTC|250.07 billion|0.0213557676751335|20 billion|
|$AMD|113.58 Billion|0.0154633678148662|3.24 billion|
|$NVDA|370.44 Billion|0.0010694293591779|3.11 billion|

As someone who has been in the hardware space and is up to date on info Intel is underpriced compared to $AMD and $NVDA. What was holding intel back was the management and it changed. Intel is about to beat AMD and I would hop on the spaceship before it goes to the moon. so what is a reasonable price?

if intel sock matches $AMD's Market Cap to revenue then its market cap would go to 700 billion. The positive press of the stock could bring it to 750 billion. But Intel's revenue is about to spike. President Joe Biden is planning to increase supply and if Intel can take advantage of that they can produce more chips where chips are out of stock. In 2020 GPU's sold out in a second leaving gamers without new gear. The 1050 ti, a failure when it came out, got rereleased and became one of the biggest successes this year. that's how desperate people are. [r/pcmasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/) was hit the hardest and many of them want the fastest gear. Intel could fill this void left by AMD and NVDA. if Intel can get enough stuff out then I could see a 500 billion market cap( with market correction, meaning that intel gets a fair price).

I currently do not have a position in INTC right now, but I plan to do so as soon as my wife's boyfriend will let me.

The concept of the original Cylance product is absolutely excellent...behavioral (not AV definition) protection against viruses. Frankly, it's the way it should have always been done. You don't need to know the name of the guy punching you in the face, you just need to prevent getting punched. However, their implementation and service was garbage. I'm saying this as someone who implemented it extensively in a large enterprise environment. BB buying Cylance was a good move, IF they can build it and support it better. However, as potentially disruptive as it could be, a rebuild has to happen fast or there will be better competition with the same philosophy very soon and that opportunity will be lost.

Unless...it's not a play for the PC and server protection market at all. If you think about it in terms of their other product offerings, it makes sense. Automotive operating systems are a massive and incredibly dangerous target, both in the frame of making sure a terrorist doesn't use your vehicle to kill you or others, and in the protection of mobile retail for the people sitting in their self-driving cars and shopping on the way to work.

Behavioral protection makes absolute sense there, as there will definitely be ties between the car itself and what you do in it. The car's sanctity must be protected at all costs. So, look to BB be integrating this protection philosophy into it's automotive efforts.

Now, on a very related topic.  

https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/

BB has teamed up with Amazon...

> The two tech companies will co-develop and market BlackBerry IVY, a new ""cloud-connected intelligent vehicle data platform"" that offers automakers a ""standardized secure way to read and analyze vehicle sensor data."" IVY will merge BlackBerry's QNX embedded OS for vehicles with AWS' IoT (Internet of Things) and machine learning services.

And Amazon is getting into the satellite-mesh internet business as a competitor to Musk's SpaceX Starlink.

https://www.pcmag.com/news/amazons-satellite-internet-service-starts-to-take-shape-with-antenna-prototype

And Amazon has bought Zoox to get into self-driving cars: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/amazon-buys-self-driving-technology-company-zoox.html

Amazon is big into antenna development: https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-marks-breakthrough-in-project-kuiper-development

> Rajeev Badyal, VP of Technology for Project Kuiper at Amazon. “This simple fact inspired one of our key tenets for Kuiper: to invent a light, compact phased array antenna that would allow us to produce an affordable customer terminal. It’s incredible to see such a small form factor delivering this type of speed and performance.”

Let's think about we've got existing or in development...

* A secure operating system (QNX)
* A system of sensors to read it (IVY)
* Cars that use the OS and provide the sensors (175 million using QNX now, will only grow)
* A system to protect the cars (Cylance or whatever is built from it)
* A massive retail company (Amazon)
* Mobile internet worldwide (Amazon's Project Kuiper)
* Cars that will use that mobile internet (phased array antenna)
* Self-driving cars (Zoox purchase)

Resulting in: A bored and captive audience of consumers, sitting in their self-driving cars, insulated from the world, protected from the bad folks, spending their cash and surfing behind tinted windows. Amazon making a ton of cash. Blackberry receiving some of that on multiple fronts.

I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just satisfied that I bought BB at $20, and will be buying more over time, maybe at a lower price but definitely at a higher one.

133,An Australian stem cell biotech about to moon $MESO,37,0.79,arkie,"I know there is a lot of shit stock going around here, and that biotechs are risky, but I've done my DD. This is no shit post, but I think we have a small Australian biotech about to go around the twist.

$MESO trades on the NASDAQ and ASX. It's a Melbourne biotech that has had a whole bunch of recent catalysts. They specifically focus on stem cell therapies to treat a range of diseases. Now if you believe in stem cell therapies long term, I think $MESO could be a good buy;  


* aGVHD: Mesoblast's Remstemcel to treat this horrible disease received a 9-1 ODAC vote but the FDA still gave Mesoblast a CRL meaning the drug wouldn't receive a BLA. They are in ongoing discussions with the FDA as this is an unmet need where no other treatment options exist with high mortality. I think this will eventually get conditional approval.
* CHF: Chronic heart failure is one of the biggest killers in the world. Their recent phase 3 trial here reduced MACE events by 60% in a statistically significant random controlled experiment. Many physicians have said this will change the paradigm of how we treat heart failure. Expect $MESO to partner with big pharma on this one. It's worth lots of tendies. It didn't meet the primary endpoint which was reduction in hospitalisations, but absolutely crushed the secondary endpoints which are more meaningful anyway.
* COVID19 ARDS: This was using remestemcel to reduce inflammation for COVID patients. Eventually they stopped enrolling as they didn't think it would reach statistical significance, mostly because the course and treatment paradigm throughout the pandemic has changed. ie, ventilator is now a last resort etc... However, these results are being unblinded and they've done a major partnership with Novartis on this one for all cause ARDS.

If you think stem cell therapies have a place as standard of care in the future then I think $MESO is a good one to throw some dumb money at considering they've completed quite a few P3 trials and it shows their product clearly works. They just need partners, getting their trials designed a bit better now that they understand more about mechanisms of action, subsets of patients and when to target them with treatment. It's only a matter of time before the first stem cell therapy is approved in the US and I think it's this lil down under biotech $MESO to get the job done.

This is not financial advice and I have my entire life savings in $MESO.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liv1xv/an_australian_stem_cell_biotech_about_to_moon_meso/,1613226630.0

*please remember, these are WHALE plays. Follow the winners and cut the losers. High risk and high reward is what this is. If you are looking for the safe guaranteed growth stuff, grab some nice SPY leaps or something.*

Congrats to those who stayed with CCL and played the QS ER callout. Those tendies have staved off starvation for a night.  These are the reason we play. 

The PLTR rebound is indeed occurring with a boost from Cathie on CNBC as predicted. FUBO is also rebounding by strongly outperming the broader NASDAQ, and I expect continued performance with indices likely rebounding in the coming days. 

**FSLY calls are just absolutely fuk. Going to baghold some through ER as a Hail Mary.** Cant get much worse. Awful. I am ashamed. 

I am fine with the M price action for now. I am fine with VXX as it’s clearly needed rn. Trim a little each time it pops on VXX. 

I am holding off on that EV consideration for now except I opened a position in XPEV and NIO hoping post lunar new year buying will give us a little help in a beaten down industry. 2/26 ATM. TSLA has really turned it around today. 

Stay strong. Prayers up for the little homie FSLY 😭 

**2/17 PRE MARKET UPDATE**

The latest retail numbers were outstanding during the report this morning, which as an interesting side affect have caused a giant spike in the treasury yield. 

For the uninitiated, higher treasury yields bring downward pressure on stocks. Will be watching closely to see if the yield flattens on the open. 

Hope you grabbed the recommended VXX; as I mentioned the stubborn treasury yield could present some short term issues.

FSLY PLEASE FUCKING FLY

**The state of the DD: Update 1 2/16**

When these positions open big, please wait for dips FYI. I believe in the plays, but you need to choose entry points with common sense discretion. 

**Correct** on the sector rotation into DOW/cyclicals. M hit decently, CCL smashed and saved my portfolio today with +9%

**Incorrect**:IV wasn’t enough to save a very shit day from FSLY— the DAQ was a whipsaw today, though, so that didn’t help. 

**Incorrect but frustrating** FUBO got an announcement today that Comcast was buying a 9% investment stake, institutional money continued flowing in, yet it tanked. I guess the shorts are too strong. 
EDIT: monster AH movement from FUBO

**How I moved** trimmed FSLY and FUBO but clutching still, and opened a big position in PSTH in the morning still holding. Holding CCL and M too. I update when I’m moving on twitter, but I can’t post that info here so maybe I’ll just update here at the end of each day and maybe in the morning.

————————-

Hi.  Here's what I'm looking at headed into next week. **Shoutout to Unusual Whales who I’ve spoken with and has given their blessing for me to provide these plays and screenshots. I recommend them bigly**

I monitor flow on Barchart and Think or Swim

I’ve typically written about choosing close-dated plays, but I’m giving a little expiration room on these as I sense some sector rotation I want to feel out. 

Been on a nice little streak with these of late, so I am overdue for an account correction lol.  This is not investment advice.

*The whale plays I am interested in:*

[FSLY 2/26 110c](https://i.imgur.com/U00vNOa.jpg)🚀 🚀 🚀 

I like this for two reasons.  **The first is simple**: I've seen repeat call flow into FSLY building up over the past two weeks, and it just can't sustain the pops yet.  It's a similar pattern I saw to the DKNG and NIO calls before their pops.  *Continued betting OTM by whales gives me more confidence with each slip, and pressure for an upward pop is building.*. **The second reason** is the dump after the NET ER.  I love when sympathy plays get oversold, because it's easy entry into their earnings run.  

**How I’m going to play it**: I'll follow the whale on a call spread up to 110 for 2/19, and ride it up until just before earnings Wednesday, then cut it.  Successful strategy I've been employing with tech earnings runs lately; last week I just closed my eyes and threw a dart at TWTR OTM calls and rode it up for about 100% the day of.  Sure, you miss out if earnings are a banger, but I have an increasingly strict no earnings rule.

**Earnins run= yes.  Holding through earnings= no**

[M 3/26 20c](https://i.imgur.com/ybj1GMB.jpg)🚀 🚀 🚀 

Everyone always brushes aside my precious M plays but they are a quiet money-maker.  Once the dust has settled from the Great Memeing, M is back on watch again as a quiet beast finally waking up.  ER is on 2/23, and they have a couple things going for them, including:

**1) The B of A BBBY upgrade**: [bulls are returning on BBBY now that the squeeze is over and their reasoning is strikingly similar to the M story](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyond-becomes-more-attractive-with-short-squeeze-over-b-of-a-says-11613076266).  Store closures?  Bullish.  Narrowly avoiding bankruptcy? Mega boolish.  But more importantly...
**2) Digital integration**: the CEO of M is actually a solid leader, and has really pushed the transition to digital and online merchandising.  I think this pivot will gain more spotlight headed into ER.

**How I’ll play it**: M is a super streaky stock that can give you 8% return multiple days in a row, but can also frustratingly do the opposite.  It also tends to really crater in the mornings before stabilization and rising late in the day.  I will give this manic whale a chance on the 3/26c, while also clutching a more reasonable 16c 2/26 into the ER.  I will cut the 3/26 20c at the first sign of multi-day trouble

[VXX 4/1 20c ](https://i.imgur.com/kmKd8NC.jpg) 🚀 😭 

I have long been a consort of the mystical VXX, and [here is a previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I did on how it works.  It is approaching absurd lows, fear and greed is rising, and all that other doomed shit you hear.  What really signals to me this is the time to expand this hedge is the potential for sector rotation (and the currently happening rotation).  **As money outflows from big tech this past week post-earnings, we are seeing an expansion of call flow into more speculative industries like again like weed, EV, and forgotten titans like industrials/cyclicals, so forth.**  AnAlYsTS will try to scare you in the coming weeks and say tech is overvalued and done--this is untrue, but the outflow/inflow tides of the market will present plenty of transition pain dips that feel like corrections.

**How I’ll play it:** a VXX 16c 2/26 feels right to purchase on a Tuesday dip meant)


[CCL 3/12 25.5](https://i.imgur.com/zfdoec7.jpg)🚀 🚀 

Another one that has seen a lot of call pressure building up.  This cruise line seems like it's just waiting for more favorable news to give it a huge push.  *I understand and agree with the problems with travel right now: this is not an endorsement of the end of COVID, but I like the stock*, and I like the potential for upward movement.  I'll likely play this one as the whale has and exercise patience.  Has potential for wild swings, though, so keeping a close eye on this one.

**EV grab bag: TSLA 3/19 970c NIO 3/5 67.5c WKHS 2/19 46c (QS assorted strikes for ER run &?upgrades, and FSR off upgrades)**🚗 🚀 

Major call flow into both NIO and TSLA all week; my last DD I was able to successfully pinpoint this movement into NIO, and it feels similar.  **QS and FSR got lots of attention after upgrades and into QS earnings, but the titans are positioned to explode after some from frustrating coiling**. NIO in particular lately has been moving slower than a white man in slippers.  TSLA is a pricey ass premium, so maybe consider focusing on NIO or call spreads.

**BONUS**: QS earnings could be when they finally reveal their revolutionary technology which prevents dendrites. This is the holy grail of EV battery production, and they boldly claim they have figured it out. The lawsuit is standard hot air from people upset their stock tanked in this weird ass meme of a market and I am unbothered. 

**WKHS dip feels like it was a blessing,** but I may wait for a little more dip on Tuesday because this thing is streaky as fuck.  People could be positioning into the Q2 (hopeful) EV deal announcement with the USPS.

[FUBO 2/26 42c and 2/19 56c](https://i.imgur.com/blCr0q3.jpg)🚀 🚀 

**EDIT: shoutout to /u/4p0rn0nly who pointed on that the 55c has a more favorable bid/ask spread and vol/OI. This is why I keep that inbox open!**

As I was on my ROKU with the gf looking for the latest episode of ""My 600 LB Life"", got confirmation bias through an ad for FUBO lol.  More importantly, Benzinga picked up that dude from Twitter Mr. Zack Morris as an excuse to put it on their watchlist.  We all know how pumps go at this point: 
Random twitter ---> Benzinga (or other random watchlist) pickup ----> random analyst upgrades ---> CNBC pump ----> several crisis segments dedicated to WSB for MaNiPuLaTiOn

**General theme I am seeing:**

*Call flow into into big tech has really, really dried up*.  I'm hoping this continues into next week, because then we could be in a really nice position to pick up some March and April monthlies in struggling behemoths like FB.  TWTR is doing it's thing, but it seems like the looming AAPL privacy concerns have put a stranglehold on other big tech companies relying on advertising data.

**Play I just like this week:**

[PLTR reports Tuesday Premarket](https://i.imgur.com/MkoiiWz.jpg) and I think there is a chance to hop on no matter the outcome.  Sells off because earnings these days are stupid?  Buy the dip.  Starts to rocket off some news or a beat?  Hop on.  PLTR feels like a win-win rn at this price point no matter the earnings report brings.

**Fellow Bulls beware:** 🐻 

Quantitave Easing is taking a hit.  [Quietly last month, the FED announced they were discontinuing the repo program; nobody noticed this but we had a huge dip that day](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Reserve’s%20decision%20to,term%20repos%20set%20for%20Feb.&text=Overnight%20repo%20operations%20will%20continue). Treasury yield also has been stubbornly climbing.  Long story short, these are caution flags for an outflow from stonks into stable long-term securities.  Not ringing the bear alarm, but just shit you should know.

I change this a bit on Mondays based on what I'm seeing, as they re the most accurate days according to statistics. (Tuesday this time)

**TLDR**:

135,Long ass DD on why being long on Macerich will make you rich,139,0.81,ThisIsBartRick,"## Introduction

Macerich is a REIT that specialize in shopping centers (you know, that thing that you don't go to anymore because of Amazon and the pandemic).

The company has performed very poorly company wise (occupancy dropped to 89.8% in 2020 from 95.4% in 2018) and in stock price (it dropped from $90 in July 2016 to $6 in April 2020 and is now at $12.90).

There are a few worrying things about this company. So let's go through them one by one and see how bad they are.

## Their debt

They've increased their debt (from 54.5% in 2018 to 66.4% in 2019 to a whopping 83.5% of their market cap in end 2020). Leverage like that on shopping centers (you know that thing you don't go to anymore because of amazon and the pandemic) could be ok : they don't really care about the declining revenue of those shopping centers, they just need them to pay their leases. But 2 things are pretty worrisome : i) some retail stores might go bankrupt and ii) Macerich is using $1.5bn of their line of credit.

To counteract that : The bankruptcy issue for retail stores is not that big of a deal for Macerich  and they have a (good) plan if they have to repurpose a shopping mall (both explained below). And for the line of credit thingy, their unencumbered assets (an asset or property that is free and clear of any encumbrances, such as creditor claims or liens) are sufficient enough to cover their $1.5bn in line of credit if it's needed. They can also dilute the shares to raise more capital. They've also filed for an ATM offering for up to $500 million.

## Occupancy / Rent collection 

Their occupancy is at 89.7	% (for the shopping centers that are not under development nor redevelopment). This is down from the 95.4% it was at in 2018 or the 94% in 2019.

The good news however is that ""*rent collections, for example, during April and May were 35%, that grew to 80% in the third quarter. And as of today, the fourth quarter rent collections were at 92% and rising by the week.*"" said Tom O'Hern, CEO of Macerich in their recent Earnings call.


## The declining trend of brick-and-mortar stores and shopping malls in general

That's a big one and this has been a much bigger trend as the pandemic forced some people to buy things online. This trend is also not new at all as [this Vox article shows very well](https://www.vox.com/recode/21561046/death-rebirth-department-stores-retail-charts).

But the silver lining is that as some retail stores are going bankrupt, the big shopping centers are getting stronger from having less competition. And since Macerich has mostly big shopping centers, that's pretty good for them.

## What about the bankrupt stores in the near future

Green Street Advisors expects ""about a little more than half of all mall-based department stores to close by the end of 2021.""

That can be a big problem but  they seem to be prepared for it. They're planning on doing some mixed-use development and I like it. Doug said in their most recent earnings call :

> However, we know our shoppers want more than just traditional retail. And that's why we continue to focus on bringing alternative uses to our campuses and not just retail. Uses like office, residential, hospitality, medical, wellness, education, fitness, grocery, service and even storage, and that's why we continue to refer to our properties as town centers because that's what they're becoming. They're transformational and will be something for everyone. And they have to be because that's what our modern-day shopper wants.

What makes me even more optimistic is that most of the estate they own is in California (25.8%) and New York (23.1%). Those are very high density locations which are the most promising places for redevelopment or for mixed-use purposes.

## The repurpose of their buildings 

That's great to know that they're *planning* on ""bringing alternative uses to [their] campuses"" but how faisible is it and how much will that help them?

First, let's see what Macerich could convert its buildings to :

- Offices but there's a lot of uncertainty in this area. We're in the middle of a big shift in this regard which might benefit them or not.
- Other retail stores but jesus christ this market is not doing good right now and has not been doing well years before the pandemic.
- Industrial complexes like warehouses are booming right now thanks to e-commerce and the pandemic. This looks really promising if they go down that road but they need to do this quickly and strategically as all locations are not necessarily interesting. 
- Housing which a lot of real estate have mixed feelings about.

Or Macerich could do another interesting thing : mixed-use development. 

> It is a type of urban development, urban planning and/or a zoning type that blends residential, commercial, cultural, institutional, or entertainment uses into one space, where those functions are to some degree physically and functionally integrated, and that provides pedestrian connections.

Most of the estate they own is in California (25.8%) and New York (23.1%). So let's evaluate their possibilities in those locations that they've invested in. 

**California**

Let's start with California and use [the Allen Matkins/UCLA Anderson 2021 winter forecast](https://www.allenmatkins.com/anderson-forecast/allen-matkins-ucla-anderson-forecast-california-cre-survey.html). They've polled a lot of real estate professionals in California and here are the results :

They're pretty pessimistic about offices ROI today but they're confident that demand will increase. HOWEVER, ""*the panelists believe that newly built space, in addition to that freed by companies reducing their existing space, will outstrip any near-term increased demand for office space*"". Outch! Right in the feels!

Ok so not offices how about retail spaces? That one is short : ""*62% of panelists indicated that they will not develop any new properties in the coming 12 months*"".

Also :

> Overall, the level of new retail property construction is expected to significantly decline from 2020 through 2023; and some existing space, lacking sufficient demand, will be converted to other uses.

However, for the industrial space market, they're really optimistic : ""*approximately 30 percent of the panelists stated that the experience of the recession has caused them to consider increasing the amount of development they will undertake.*"".

They're also expecting that the housing market will grow steadily when the economy rebounds.

So I'm pretty optimistic for California if they need to repurpose their buildings : they could turn those spaces into housing or warehouses/industrial complexes or in mixed-use schemes.

And how about Ney York??

**New York**

Well... The short-term outlook is not that pretty!

In end of July 2020, Metro Manhattan reports that [Office sales have dropped 58%](https://www.metro-manhattan.com/blog/report-new-york-city-office-sales-drop-58-during-lockdown/) and [retail sales activity dropped 78%](https://www.metro-manhattan.com/blog/report-retail-sales-activity-drops-78-during-nyc-lockdown/) during the lockdown.

[Also](https://therealdeal.com/2020/10/19/new-yorks-cre-woes-could-spread-nationwide-investors/) :

> Citing Trepp, the Journal reported that more than $3 billion worth of loans backing commercial property in the five boroughs are delinquent, and loans in creditor negotiations amount to an additional $4 billion.

Finally, a lot of people are leaving the city because i) it's the epicenter of the pandemic and ii) it's a very dense city that was attractive because most of the activity is there. Now that people can work from home, they're no longer trapped in the city and [110,00 people left during the lockdown as a result](https://www.mymove.com/moving/covid-19/coronavirus-moving-trends/).

So all of this hurts offices, housing market and retail stores (because less people means less sales) *in the short term*.

For the long term, long story short, that's going to be the same as California but they will need to repurpose a lot more buildings as the situation is much worse in New York.

**An the rest of the commercial real estate though?**

There's [a nice report](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/commercial-real-estate-outlook.html) by Deloitte. The key messages summarize it well but I encourage you to read the whole thing as this is pretty interesting not only for Macerich but for all REIT investing in shopping centers in the US.

## Conclusion

Macerich is pretty undervalued right now with a maket cap close to $2bn. It's pretty understandable because of the situation it is in right now : their debt is pretty important and commercial real estate is in terrible state right now in general. But their finances getting better as of end 2020, their occupancy approaching 90%, their interesting plans for unoccupied stores and the promising long-term outlook in California and New York (the 2 locations they're mostly invested in) shows a very good upside while the downside seems to be already priced in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj3xy8/long_ass_dd_on_why_being_long_on_macerich_will/,1613263311.0
136,$UBS lazy Saturday morning half-ass DD,25,0.72,iaintabotdotcom,"UBS is trading at an extremely discounted rate.  Not sure how long this will continue but they’re only trading around 8.5x...here’s a competitors list and what value they’re trading at:

WFC over 80x

C around 12.5x

TFC is 17.5x

USB is 15.5x

PNC is 9.5x

COF is 23x

Ignoring the outlier of WFC...our median is around 15.5x

If UBS gets priced at 15.5x we get an increase in share value from $15.40 to $28.  This is an 82% increase.  I think this will happen thru actions of UBS themselves because they’ve initiated a 3yr stock buyback program, valued at $4.5 Billion and they plan to buyback $1.1 Billion in the first quarter.  The total buyback would reduce the amount of outstanding shares by around 300M.  Thus increasing the share price to around $18.33 at current price to earning.

However by reducing the amount of outstanding shares...it will significantly reduce dividend expense, and exponentially increase institutional value (while also lining the pockets of the execs including the new CEO - Ralph Hamers). Rumor is the new CEO was brought in to bring UBS into the digital future.

137,Let's talk about LoanDepot (LDi) and it's potential upside movement in the next few weeks.,None,0.5,FSOHelp,"Alright guys, I know you are all busy trying to find the next meme stock to make everyone lose money, but I think LDi is a legit GROWTH company that's going to at least double over the next month. 

&#x200B;

# What is LoanDepot?

Loan Depot is the second largest nonbank Mortgage Originator in the united states. Having gone public in just the last few days. It's taken a similar approach that other mortgage originator IPOs have gone in the last few years, [a severely underpriced IPO](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/loandepot-raises-just-54m-in-downsized-ipo/) LDi isnt too far behind Rocket Mortgage, arguably the #1 in the space right now. LDI has a 3 billion dollar market cap, **compared to Rocket's 40 billion dollar market cap.** Even though LDI is more storefront focused and RKT is dominant with their online presence and super bowl ads, if these companies are even in the same universe, **there is still massive upside for LDI.** Sure, we have to take into consideration that Rocket absolutely dumped right after it's IPO after an initial pop, but the company was already fully valued. LDI is not. I'm setting a $100 price target after a few months. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Another interesting catalyst

&#x200B;

Loan depot is about to have an earnings call on the [18th of this month](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/loandepot-inc-report-fourth-quarter-130000039.html). It's my understanding that they don't even need to do this as they have just gone public. This could be a huge announcement, or some forward looking statements/guidance that they are releasing to burn the underwriters who severely underpriced their company and left them with just 54 million in cash after years of trying to go public. Mortgage originations are at multi year highs, and interest rates are dirt cheap, so im not thinking that this is a multi-year growth stock, however a hold for a few months might have a huge payoff. In the end, make your own decision but I really think this one is a no brainer. What do you guys think?

&#x200B;

138,DD: Cloudflare (NET) is going to continue its strong outperformance. Buy the dip,136,0.83,StarksTwins,"Alright guys. This is going to be long, but if you want actual DD, sit back and enjoy. NET is doing excellent, and will only continue to excel as it continues to grab market share and boom in the background.

**---**

**What is Cloudflare?**

Cloudflare is going to make a leading player in next-generation computing. From their blog: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/). Excerpt:

>“Imagine you’re the maintainer of a high-traffic media website, and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare.  
Page speed is critical. You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism...  you’re going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner...Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter”

Seriously, this is cool, and it’s only beginning. Cloudflare is innovating every day. Their customers absolutely love them. As a software engineer, they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. I think what’s going to help them into a powerhouse is this:

>Over the coming months, we’ll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience. It’ll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we’ll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won’t just be your frontend, it’ll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.

Soon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare’s network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they’ll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.

If you’re not a developer, you probably didn’t understand most of that, but essentially, they’re making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money.

I can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it’s profitability... 🚀🚀🚀

(And even if it doesn’t, and stays at 50%, it will still 🚀 but slower. Regardless, it’s going up)

\---

“BuT iT tAnKeD oN EaRnInGs”

That drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren’t long. Plus it’s hardly a tank when it’s at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher

Its earnings was good, and to those who haven’t read it, [do so](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/) besides relying on a stock’s immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:

>Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings

Revenue right now is $125 million. Doesn’t sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that’s $1 billion a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion

Yes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That’s why I’m long Jan 21 115c.

The revenue and growth isn’t the impressive part. The margins are

>GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019.

High 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it's consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they’re going to be **raking** in dough

That being said, NET isn’t profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they’ve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn’t stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there’s nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here’s why:

\- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early ‘22

\- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare’s network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that.

\- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors.

—-

**CONS**

The only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I’m a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there’s no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don’t matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare’s “Build a Better Internet” shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare’s already enormous Cloudflare network.

This stock already got [multiple](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren’t in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I’m trying to be conservative here).

Seriously, give this a second look. I’ve been playing NET since 37. It’s a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn’t done its 30% move. I’m completely assured that it will soon",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj1vhs/dd_cloudflare_net_is_going_to_continue_its_strong/,1613256673.0
139,COTY dd - Makeup Never Dies,85,0.83,tdotrollin,"Below is my DD on why COTY will be comeback play that combines new growth and returning revenues post-covid.

**What is COTY?** Coty is the makeup/cosmetics king. With its subsidiaries, it develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes fragrances, cosmetics, skin care, nail care, and both professional and retail hair care products. Coty owns around 77 brands as of 2018. These brands include: Covergirl, Burberry, Gucci, Calvin Klein, Boss, Chloe ETC. You can google the rest if you are curious.

**Why are they beaten down?** One major reason: With the pandemic, a lot of girls have adopted work from home/stay home lifestyles. Basically, alot of girls are too lazy and don't find the necessity to put on any makeup or perfume if they are just sitting at home with their sweatpants on. 

**Recovery/Online Growth**: Makeup/skincare isn't going anywhere, this isn't a dying industry. Also this has jump started COTY's e-commerce sales though their retail sales were hurting. According to their recent 4Q earnings call they are reporting that their percentage of net revenue through e-commerce has DOUBLED from pre-covid. As they invest in their e-commerce and online sales partnerships I can see this growing into a cosmetics/skincare version of Chewy. 

**Asian Expansion**: They are investing heavily in the Asian market and are seeing huge revenue gains from their previous investment. China is a huge market for cosmetics, especially premium skincare brands. Trust me, from dating alot of asian girls, they use makeup and skincare like its CRACK. They are addicted to the stuff. According to the CEO they have seen a whopping 40% Year Over Year increase in their prestige brand skincare retail sales in China. Considering again the lockdown environment this would probably be magnitudes higher if it were a non-pandemic year. Another sign of huge potential in Asia, is their Gucci skincare brand partnership with a Chinese Influencer had over 100million digital convos, the amount of skincare addicts in asia is insane and COTY will be making bank.

**New Leadership** - Sue Nabi new CEO, appointed July 2020, is a growth innovator in the beuty industry. Before joining COTY she oversaw double digit growth 4 years in a row in both Loreal Paris and Lancome. She also launched a booming green new-age skincare brand back in 2014. She is exactly what COTY needs, a younger smarter visionary CEO with the guts and experience to turn this retail focused blob into a online growth juggernaut.

**Price predictions**: I believe by eoy COTY will be back to 15 just as a recovery play. As they further expand their asian and online presense I could see them getting valued more as a growth play over the next 2 years. Growth price target: 50+

140,You might consider entering $ATVI,None,0.21,Seiphert,"Hi there, 2nd post because my first one was shit.

Welcome my retards and Yolo artists,

As many of you know, blizzcon 2021 is coming and here a few prediction from my side:

Wow, the biggest IP of Activision Blizzard will get a new major content patch in April-June, making people re subscribe to experience the content.

Diablo 4 will get a release date with pre ordering enabled surging in sweet millions. 

Overwatch 2 will be released this year so more millions for them. 

Hearthstone will get a new battle pass in the next few months so again a few bucks more. 


Q: Activision Blizzard has a 80B market cap, will D4 even rise it high? 
A: probably yes. If we look at the Release of shadow lands and many people returning to wow buying a monthly subscription and the expansion for ~60$ has increased the price of the stock from 80$ to something above 90$ now blizzcon pre-orders had pushed it to 100$/share. Diablo 4 might at least push the worth of the stock by 10$ because I assume 90% of the wow fanbase are also Diablo fans. 

All in all I think investing in Activision-Blizzard is a no brainer at the given time. Since the release of classic Wow servers and shadowlands they have been slowly but steady regaining worth and if they won't fuck up during an esports event a la Blitzchung, it is pretty safe to assume the stonks will go up to at least 120$/stonk.

141,AMD and Intel DD,128,0.85,Quinten_EN,"With the pandemic still going on and everyone needing more computers than ever and the ongoing trade war with China, there is a severe Chip shortage.

On Thursday, the CEOs of the major Chip producers (Intel, AMD, QCOM) have sent a letter to Biden that he should sent out an executive order to adress this shortage. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage))

I see three different scenarios:

1. Biden gives an executive order to build improve and increase the domestic chip foundries. This would be most bullish for Intel, since they are the only company with foundries in the USA. This would also help AMD and QCOM, since they would most likely that access to cheaper chips.
2. Biden lifts the trade restrictions set on semiconductors. This would mean that AMD and QCOM would get access to cheaper chips, but it would not solve the shortage of silicon so it is unlikely to happen. This would be bullish for AMD and Qualcomm, but it would not change the situation for Intel.
3. Biden does not do anything and the shortage will continue. If Biden does this nothing will be changed, it will be neither good or bad from Intel and AMD. AMD will still keep growing at a massive rate and Intel will still be a cash cow.

So regardless of what happens, I am very bullish on the semiconductor industry. I expect Biden to start ramping up semiconductor manufacturing the USA, because of his tough stance on China. At the moment almost all of the semiconductor industry is relying on Taiwan, and with the Chinese involvement in that country, it is very likely that their is bipartisan support for increasing semiconductor manufacturing domestically.

Advice: if you want to play this, buy calls that are at least 2 to 3 months out, or buy shares.

143,UWMC: a powder keg with over 100% of float shorted,87,0.64,pennyking91,"listen up retards i'm gonna make this brief so you can go back to clipping the toe nails of your wife's boyfriend

all you autists looking ""for the next GME"". well guess what, there is no next GME. that milk's spilt, sour and cold. but there's a company out there so boring, so \*\*\*\*ing uninteresting, that just like GME is has strong value characteristics, and has over 100% short float, and it's hiding in plain sight.

**UWMC**: stands for United Whole Mortgage C\*nts. they do things with mortgages. right now, the market doesn't really like things to do with mortgages, because its a cyclical business nearing its peak. it's pumping out great returns (maybe at this peak) and valued at only 5.5x P/E. the market don't care. Last earnings, the company reported EBITDA of $1.4B FOR THE QUARTER (whole market cap of only $15B). It also has a big boomer 4.5% dividend. This sh\*t is unloved just like your dross GME was, and like GME is actually a fly guy of a bizniz

**The set-up**: this was a former SPAC. I know, I know. Some of you apes held this when it was a SPAC, and now your diapers are in a twist because it didn't moon. Well, f\*\*\* off I don't care. You're not the only ones: HFs are short this guy like you wouldn't believe. THE FLOAT IS ONLY 6% OF THE ENTIRE MARKET CAP, and half of it is like by one institution that's in it for the long-term (Magnetar). That means the effective float is only 3%! Right now it's being manipulated like you wouldn't believe. This thing is a powder keg and it can explode in the shorts' face.

**The mooning**: There are huge numbers of calls at $15 and $17.5. If this thing gets anywhere close to them in a short period of time, the gamma squeeze could propel this thing to $50-60 in a week. If it doesn't. If it doesn't, you're holding an actual good clucking company at 5.5x PE, so you're brains wont be over your windshield like you late weed apes. Fundamentally it's probably worth $20-25, so you have an actual fundamental value play here too just as a back-up

**The play**: buy shares first! This thing has a squoze in it. Also buy 2/19 and 3/19 calls at $10-17.5

**DD link for short report**: [https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/UWMC](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/UWMC)

**TLDR**: everyone hated GME. now every hates UWMC. UWMC is boring and doesn't get you high so you apes have missed it, but it has effective 100% short interest for tiny float (3%) of company, strong fundamentals and a squeeze that hasn't squoze, company worth double anyway but could easily run up 10x if the shorts get nuk'd

**Me**: in for 4,000 shares at $9.18. this is not financial advice. do your own diligence you cucks.

144,$TSLA is positioned for a massive reversal,442,0.81,KRVROTMG,"Tesla's current market cap is the result of multiple positive feedback loops which has pushed its price to a ludicrous level via Short + Gamma Squeezes (it is also important to note virtually all TSLA shorts are out^(1)). This campaign has been largely led by large hedge funds. Without S&P inclusion, the story might have ended there with hedge funds trying to escape with their profits and leaving retail the bag. However, S&P inclusion presented these hedge funds with a much better option to close out their positions while also riding the stock down. The shares that hedge funds no longer wanted began to be picked up by passive funds leading to selloffs by the active funds which pushed prices to this level.

With passive funds holding the bag, the hedge funds which lead the rally seem to be attempting to push the price back down through a reverse gamma squeeze^(2).

No retail trader is buying 1m+ in deep OTM puts, this is an attempt by hedgies to push the price down.

We can also see this from the massive shift in options volume. $190B of calls open interest and over $250B of puts open interest, a massive put skew. This is especially significant because ""To put it in context it is equal to the combined $AAPL and $AMZN bullish skew or if you’d rather to the combined  $BABA, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG and $WMT combined."" reflecting extremely bearish sentiment in an very very bullish market.

Once the reversal begins there will be nothing stopping it as OTM puts get less and less OTM. There are no shorts left to be squeezed and the bag holding passive funds which are largely barred from holding derivatives will have no way of rebalancing the options skew.

Smuckers, is it the stock of the future, could it be the low risk hedge you have been looking to get you out of a Jam!

Trading as ticker SJM and with earnings coming up on **Feb 25th 2021**, it might be one of the lowest risks on the stock market with a large potential to the upside.

If you compare large caps, it has a very strong P/FCF ratio of 14.04. It sitting at number **#1** for best P/FCF out of all the **packaged foods** stocks and in the entire **Consumer Defense** Sector, it is #7.

“Hey guys hopefully there will be a squeeze ,if not ,all we have to do is hold and a squeeze will just keep happening look at Tesla it is still squeezing that’s why it is up to $4300 a share before split and the exact same thing happening to game stop ,

Either way it is a good investment and that’s the reason I am buying more at every dip 👐💎👐💎👐

Everybody keep saying I wish I could’ve got in on Tesla when it was $50 here’s your chance the only difference is this one is called GameStop GME

I am not a financial advisor just put a lot of research into it

GME. 💎👐💎👐💎👐💎🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀”

... Honestly I have been in the market for years now and have constantly been baffled by the fact that TSLA is always up. This. This makes sense.

Guys, Gals, Apes, and those who sexually identify as an Apache helicopter (like myself), I think this squeeze might be another TSLA. Way less exciting than what we are wanting... but long term... potentially a gold mine (or diamond mine if you’d rather). Stay strong folks.

147,$RKT ready for take-off...,250,0.83,CharlesLupton,"Warning this is HIGHLY speculative, but data points to it as a possibility.

First, Dan Gilbert and Warren Buffet are friends. This we know.

Second, according to the IPO, RHI (AKA Dan Gilbert) via the Class D shares retains 79% of the voting power, but currently has 94.2% of the economic interest based on his holdings of 94.2% of the total stock. It's therefore likely out of any deals he wishes to retain that 79% interest in the stock/voting(this becomes important later).

Third, between Berkshire's 13f filing on 11/16 (with a portion submitted separately as confidential), it was widely reported Buffet had plans for a ""secret"" investment, but how much and in what company?

The how much we know, the difference between their 13f and 10q filings (minus some foreign investments) is approximately $9 billion. Then there is the what? We do know his largest reductions were in bank stocks(the biggest reduction being in Wells Fargo), but does buffet really want to move away from finance or maybe he just wants to reposition in finance away from traditional banks.

If it's the latter, $RKT makes sense, but how do you buy $9 billion of a $40 billion company without anyone knowing? Timing....

$RKT reports on the 25th after various organizations have to report on the 16th (15th is a financial holiday). Over a 5% stake has to be reported within 10 days. RHI reported it's holdings early in the month. If RHI wants to they can convert 15.2%(94.2% - 79%) equivalent of the total outstanding stock from Class D to Class A in a private equity sale(AKA Black Book) so as not to directly affect the stock price, not report it for up to 10 days, and keep their 79% vote share/Economic interest. Then Berkshire can report their 13f and a bit later file their 10q on the purchase. With $RKT reporting the ""big partnership"" just before ER to maxmize momentum going in to it. 

Relationships, nummbers, dates for filing and chosen, all lead me to believe $RKT is the secret Buffet investment and plans to acquire about 25% of the company. This also means with four profitable quarters(the fourth being announce on the 25th) $RKT would also be eligible for S&P inclusion(due to the float increase) adding further value to the acquisition. All that plus the high short interest scrambling to get out(and Buffet followers scrambling to get in) and $RKT could soon be a multi-bagger in short order.

Note: 9 billion was likely based on the original $27 for 150 mil share original prospectus, but likely the deal changed after $RKT hasn't performed as well and likely the $1 billion buyback was announced to help that performance(Buffet thinks buybacks should be used for price support by companies so it follows his theory on their use).

Edit: I'd watch to see if the 13f still shows confidential as the lock-up didn't end until 02/02 and the transaction would likely be scheduled for the 16th so it doesn't need to be reported for 10 days, aka the 26th which just happens to be the day after RKT's ER call. Also, no other company has reported 5%+ new economic ownership by Berkshire since their Nov. 16th 13f.

Edit 2: It also makes sense from a non-investment business perspective. It would provide synchronicity with other Buffet holdings. It would help with Gieco(mortgage customers to Geico and Geico customers to RKT), Berkadia(multi-family/commercial lending which RKT doesn't handle), Berkshire Hathaway Automotive(sells cars, but doesn't handle direct financing, but RKT Auto does), Cavalier and Clayton homes(new homes which can be passed to RKT to increase sales there), and finally Home Services(realtor group).

Edit(02/16): Calls down big today, but still holding. I think today will be the bottom before the ER run-up.

Edit 2: Berkshire put out it's holdings as of 12/31. Looks like the ""Secret Position"" was a combo of Chevron and Verizon. Best I can tell nothing is currently marked ""Confidential"". 

ER is the next big event on 02/25 and the ""new financial partnership"" is likely to be announced then, but as to who it is, that's anybody's guess now. Today doesn't discount Berkshire, but it does mean RKT wasn't the ""confidential"" position.

They make money by providing a marketplace and information services, so they're the Ebay of stocks. Except they make money getting companies listed rather than used clothes.

Going off the books, they're a little overvalued right now. Morningstar places their fair value at $99 and they closed at $111.02 today while their PE ratio is 29.67. However, they have steadily grown these last few years and I expect them to continue for one vital reason: A whole lot more investors are on the market.

Both with the explosion of discount brokers last year and the explosion of this sub in the last month means there's actually more money on the market. As new investors dip their toes in the water and/or recover from the pandemic unemployment that number will go up. Also, the rate of IPOs are also rising for the very reason there's a lot more interest in stocks now.

150,CureVac (CVAC) making the coronavirus vaccine for Europoors and beyond,31,0.81,kbxl,"I’m new, sort of. I joined a couple of years back and got turned off by all the rockets so I unsubscribed. I was reminded of WSB recently when I read a bestof post about someone who made enough money to pay for his dog’s surgery. WSB, making money? I got a flash back of all the rockets, of how I thought going long on Tesla was dumb, and cried inside when I compared to the stock price today. So I re-joined and promptly lost 2.5k with GME (my fault, got greedy). I regained it in weed plus a little extra, so we’re good. 



What to do with this fresh money?



I got curious about CureVac today as I read that they *“announced initiation of a rolling submission with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for CVnCoV, the company’s mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate, currently in late-stage clinical testing.”* I looked into it, here are my notes: 



CureVac (CVAC) is German biotech with 20 years of experience but new on the stock market (IPOed in August 2020, current market cap 21.4bn).



They developed a COVID mRNA vaccine (similar to Pfizer/Biontech and Moderna) but the CureVac can be shipped and stored at fridge temperature, a major logistics advantage compared to the others. It’s cheaper to store and transport and can also be used in poor countries that don't have the kind of cold storage the other mRNA vaccines need.



The vaccine is currently in phase 3 testing—a U.K. trial has finished enrolling 15,000 participants, and another global phase 2b/3 study aims to recruit more than 35,000 volunteers. (They already know it works and it’s safe so far; in Phase 3 they’re assessing how well it works plus more safety data.)



CureVac is in collaboration with the UK Government (the UK will provide them with scientific data regarding new strains), Bayer (to scale production of its vaccine, 160m doses) and GSK (to produce 100m doses and to jointly develop second generation vaccines).



The European Commission already has an order in for 405 million doses. It gave CureVac €75 million in funding to develop CVnCoV, adding to around €300 million provided by the German government.

The UK ordered 50m doses.



CureVac and partners expect to produce up to 300m doses in 2021 and up to 600m in 2022.



Whenever a new variant of the virus emerges, they can make a vaccine “update” in a matter of weeks. Furthermore, they're collaborating with GSK to make the second generation of vaccines (i.e. multivalent vaccines that cover multiple mutations of the coronavirus or multiple respiratory viruses). Such vaccines could become available 2022 subject to regulatory approval.



Other developments in the pipeline: rabies vaccine, and a couple of injectable drugs for skin and lung cancers in Phase 1 clinical trials (preliminary tests in humans). 



**Financials**

Being a newly listed company, there’s not much data to go with. I only found the *Third Quarter and First 9 Months 2020 Financial Results* on their website and didn’t look further. There’s probably a German website where you can find past balance sheet information for the company, but my German sucks. So I only go with this one report I found (first link in the list of sources). I nearly failed my accounting exam and probably only passed it because I cried, you better read the report yourself if you know how to read.


Comparison between Q1-Q3 2020 vs the same period in 2019:

Revenue: 43m (2020) vs 11m (2019)

Net loss: -71m vs -64m (despite spending 46m more in R&D in 2020)

Obviously, these are numbers before they start selling the vaccine (assuming it passes Phase 3). Trying to look at the future, I couldn’t find any info on the vaccine pricing or how much profit they expect to make per dose. But they’ve *“ruled out selling its inoculation at cost, arguing instead for an “ethical margin” for shareholders.”*. Comparatively, *“AstraZeneca and J&J have said they would not seek to profit from their vaccines, at least during the pandemic. “*



They have €892 million in cash as of September 30th, 2020 (from the German govt, the deal with GSK, the IPO and the grant/loan from the European Investment Bank). 



Major shareholders include the founder, the German government and one of the founders of SAP.



Position: [1 x Jan2023 115C](https://imgur.com/a/mJcge6P). 

I’m an Europoor. I barely had the money to make this one call. I have no qualifications in finance or pharma. Don’t listen to me. Rockets.

here's why y'all are sleeping on Cloudflare $NET

Cloudflare ($NET) is a web infrastructure and security company that [has a history of defending free speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare#Controversies). They are one of the largest neutral cloud service providers in the U.S. and they innovate a lot in network security and product development.

**Beat earnings by 33%, price dropped 7%**

* Previous quarters they had performed much better, but beating expected EPS by 33% and losing 7% of its share price in a day just makes it a better value right now at $86.

**Price targets above $100 (Currently $86)**

* Many companies are [raising their price targets](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) anywhere between $90-$105.

**364% annual growth**

* They IPO'd at $15 a share for a $525M market cap, but immediately traded at $18. They have **363% growth in the past year**. There's plenty of growth left, especially if (when?) they strike a deal with a huge customer. They have [lots of new, innovative products](https://www.cloudflare.com/whats-new/) coming out *often*.

**Good for big companies**

* If a social media platform or news outlet needed a neutral cloud provider in 2021, Cloudflare has the infrastructure to support them.

**Good for small companies**

* They are liked by the tech community and offer free security services like [DDoS protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/), [DNS encryption](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/04/how-to-keep-your-isps-nose-out-of-your-browser-history-with-encrypted-dns/), and [domain name hosting](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/), making it ideal for getting customers early on. Very [ARK](https://ark-invest.com/invest-in-innovation/)\-esque IMO.

**History of defending free speech**

* Although they have cut ties with 8chan and The Daily Stormer from public pressure after violent attacks, Cloudflare has a [history of defending free speech even under scrutiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudflare#Controversies). They don't practice shadowbanning or act very partisan AFAIK.

152,PLTR DD - brain cells required if you are an ape!,1773,0.95,PutsOnYourWife,"Hello fellow retards

I know these are difficult times for this sub and it’s almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.

Instead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.

The following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn’t my native language. I will try my best.

**Palantir as a Company – the beginnings**

PLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this – Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government….but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.

You retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji’s to pump your dopamine and keep you happy. 🚀🚀🚀

Let’s start with the DD

First of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.

&#x200B;

* **1. The Management**

Before I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won’t be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.

* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**

Before we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don’t have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don’t fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers’ base isn’t neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That’s the reason why their products aren’t so tangible for many people.

PLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn’t sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called “Gotham” and “Foundry” You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:

First example is Syria with Gotham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the “rest of the world” for you. But this wasn’t so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information’s are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)

Actually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.

In their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way

“Gotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.”

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)

The second example is about “Foundry” and it’s directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)

“An Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.”

Both of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the “machine” with data.

The key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.

* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**

Peter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)

But this didn’t happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like „look guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions“. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn’t get the contracts. This was also the „swamp „trump was talking about.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army)

A fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.

Even with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn’t possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.

[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)

[https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)

How it’s ended? Well Peter’s wife doesn’t have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and „best practices „in the government

[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)

PLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.

&#x200B;

* **4. Valuation problems**

I could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it’s not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It’s a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.

Let’s talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn’t tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.

Now back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.

PLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)

Morgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.

These guys are very focused on numbers and I know it’s difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can’t ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.

This ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)

How is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don’t understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don’t have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don’t understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That’s why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn’t happened yet. That’s why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.

Guys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn’t possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.

Look at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I’m not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash…

On page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.

PLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it’s miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don’t understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR

&#x200B;

* **5. Risks for PLTR**

Despite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: “We face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.” The S1 Form didn’t aged well. Actually I don’t think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.

As PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn’t rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.

I think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.

There are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can’t avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It’s a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.

The risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren’t relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn’t profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said “love us or leave us alone”.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)

But even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000§. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.

&#x200B;

* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**

If you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let’s connect the dots and bring this information to a point

1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!
2. Military expenditures rising worldwide

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qqcv8vzee4h61.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98d264f091b7ff80926038660f43c57b87fc8ef2

[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)

With Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.

3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don’t have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don’t work with it but big Institutions does.

Here is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:

“The systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public — fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars — will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.”

4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don’t know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.

Facebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn’t had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.

A remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don’t get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before….

PLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.

5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It’s not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I’m not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don’t need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.

I have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.

If all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..

**What’s next?**

Now we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.

For the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.

The second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don’t got the GM deal? The stock tanked – for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.

But in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says “love us or leave us alone” sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don’t expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.

I would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3ß. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don’t think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid – long term.

What does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don’t do any market activity based on my DD. I’m just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.

My hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized “the pumpers”. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don’t do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.

I’m not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!

153,Continental Automotive has a lot of potential for a long term play (if I knew how to do emojis I would put them here),12,0.63,TheIntrovertedRunner,"This is my first DD, and I'm a bit of a smooth brain so go easy on me.

I'm here to tell you why I think Continental Automotive (CTTAY) is a great play for the EV sector.

1. **What does Continental do?** Most people think of Continental Tires when they hear the name, however, Continental does way more than that. According to their 2019 investor presentation, Rubber only accounts for 40 percent of their sales. They are the number 3 automotive parts supplier globally. Continental has also acquired many tech companies over the past few years to prepare for the EV boom. They have acquired cybersecurity companies, AI software companies, and LIDAR and antenna companies. Not to mention their partnership with NVIDIA for computing power. Overall, just a great spread of technology.
2. **Covid recovery:** Continental was hit hard by Covid just like the rest of the automotive sector. Their stock pre-Covid was around $12 dollars, with it sitting around $30 2-3 years ago. The current stock price has been hovering around $14, so it recovered nicely however not nearly as much as the rest of the automotive sector has rebounded. Major players like F, HMC, GM, TSLA, TM, and others have all far surpassed their pre-Covid highs.
3. **EV, Autonomous Driving, and 5G:** Continental has their foot in the door with almost every major vehicle manufacturer, and most manufacturers are slowly converting to EVs. They also currently have a partnership with a Chinese EV company for an electric drive train. That being said, 5G is the most interesting thing that Continental has going for it in my opinion. They are developing a 5G network access device (their previous version of this is in a majority of cars on the road). This will allow quick access to the internet for vehicles on the road.
4. **V2X:** V2X is Vehicle to X communication. This includes vehicles communicating with other vehicles on the road, which many deem necessary for fully autonomous driving. This also includes vehicle to traffic signal communication, as well as anything else a vehicle may need to communicate with, hence V2*X*. This is something I see lacking in other EV companies like Tesla, (Musk is too stubborn to admit that V2X technology will be needed to actually have autonomous driving) Continentals 5G chips will enable their V2X software to be on as many cars as they want. (Also I'm not discrediting Tesla, I've heard that gets you downvotes on this sub. Please spare me Musk daddy and Grimes mommy)

Anyway, these are just a couple of things I found while reading through their Q3 2020 Financial report as well as their 2019 plans for the future. (linked below)

Like I said I don't really know what I'm doing, (especially with like earnings and valuations) but when I read through their literature (JK I CANT READ) it seems like a lot of really interesting tech and I believe the company is currently undervalued. Totally willing to be proven wrong by some dumb ass apes tho

154,GME price action DD: making higher lows and turning an ancient resistance into support,2324,0.94,imm_uol1819,"- Pretty drawings: https://ibb.co/72gkwv7

The tits pattern is shaping up nicely.

Using nerds lingo, it could be a double cup and handle and not just a double bottom as previously suggested.

For the pattern to be confirmed, we shouldn't have any drops below $49. A strong rejection around $57 would form the handle.

- Tops and bottoms

Yeah they give us false hopes and show us the mid 50s just to push us back down on low volume duh.

But guys, we're making higher lows. That's big.

They were able to push as low as $46 (first tit in the tits pattern), then as low as $48 (2nd tit bottom), then $49 for a brief moment during power hour.

Making higher lows and claiming $49 as the new support would be massive. That's our short term goal.

Why? Because $44-$49 had been a massive resistance zone from July 2014 until November 2015. Then it dropped to oblivion.

- History repeating itself

It looks like we're losing, but we're not.

When GME was in the $10-$13 limbo in early November, the price action was eerily similar: pushed down intraday - even after strong bullish moves at open - because of the low volume.

Hopes crushed every day. But little did we know that we were making higher lows and a double cup and handle. Very similar to what's happening right now.

155,Novo Nordisk (NVO) - Boomer safety stock with tendie potential (DD... ish),24,0.67,Dammit_forgot_pw,"So, I just got 20 Novo Nordisk shares at market open for a year long play, after watching it since Wednesday. Here's why: Ozempic


If anyone in your house has Boomer cable news, then the commercial jingle would be familiar to you. (Oh-oh-oh-Ozempic-oh-oh). It's a diabetes drug that's about to explode in value later this year.


For anyone who doesn't know how drug regulation works, clinical trials are needed before the FDA will approve a drug as being safe and effective for a given indication. 


Currently Ozempic has been approved for diabetes only. Their current commercials mention that you ""may"" lose weight on the drug. They can't advertise that you ""will definitely lose weight"", because the FDA hasn't approved it for that specific indication... yet.


On Wednesday Novo Nordisk released information that their post marketing clinical trial of Ozempic proved that it could help you achieve weight loss at an average rate of around 15kg (~30 pounds) per year without a change in diet or lifestyle. Once they submit this data to the FDA, Novo will have the world's first ""thin pill"", and they can start marketing it to young women instead of just diabetic Boomers.


Of course the catch is that if you stop taking it, the weight comes back, so you have to be a customer for life... or change your lifestyle.


When the news came out on Wednesday the stock jumped $2 immediately and has been rising since. I watched it for a day thinking it might decline, but no such luck, it's going steadily up. It's a Boomer stock so low risk/low reward for now, but if this drug can be approved this year (looking likely), then it'll be great for their earnings. I think it'll be the next Viagra.


Not financial or investment advice. 
I'm just a dumb monkey that licks windows and knows that America has an epidemic of obesity and many of them have health insurance plans they can charge the drug to instead of paying for it themselves.

Disclosure: this was all taken and edited from u/krush0910 who wrote an extensive dd and you retards missed it - also I’m not an investment advisor 

Realtors have always been the vehicle of connecting buyers and sellers to one another in the process of buying or selling a home. They hold the coveted keys to the castle. The Association of Realtors has done an excellent job of protecting the industry over the past 2 decades, but technology is getting to the point where they won’t be able to continue to do this in the way they have in the past.

Only Realtors have access to MLS, however  MLS shares that data with online listing websites like Zillow and Realtor.com. Those websites then attract buyers in the market looking at property, they capture the data and then sell the data to the Realtors as leads.

Every property listed on the MLS is usually listed with a Supra iBox that houses the keys for the house for showings. Only Realtors are allowed to hold the keys to these Supra boxes and everytime they are opened, that data is captured and stored. Opendoor has created their own system for lockboxes and showings. They have their own lockboxes. And anyone can download the app to their phone and access the Opendoor properties. Without a Realtor.

In most situations, sellers list their home while they are still living in the property. They have to because until recently, there were only retail buyers who bought them and sellers needed the proceeds from their sale to buy their next house. Sellers listed their house and dealt with the headaches of showings and repairs, negotiations and strict timelines for closings. Sellers went to closing in a moving truck and so did buyers. Everything relied on perfect timing for everything to happen. Lots of drama and massive potential for any one thing to go wrong that sends the entire house of cards tumbling. Delayed lender, appraisal, yada yada yada.

Enter Opendoor. A company that pulls the power of the transaction away from the coveted few, and puts it right into the consumers’ hands. On both the buyer and seller sides. You see, they have the capital to do this. They have the money to purchase the house without the headache of the buyer’s side and their drama. Seller calls the shots on when closing happens. Seller doesn’t have to deal with showings, fixing up their house or repair negotiations, buyer’s demands, doesn’t have to rely on the buyer’s lender’s drama, have to deal with realtors, or even pay commission. (Oftentimes 6%) Opendoor makes it easy.

Money is merely a measurement of stored time and energy. People underestimate how valuable that is.  Opendoor provides value in saving both for the seller. They eliminate the stress and uncertainly of the unknown.

Opendoor owns the house after closing. They then ready the property to list for sale. They have entire departments devoted to this and marketers on staff who understand exactly what sells a house the quickest. They optimize the house with the knowledge they have.
Then they list it. Except they don’t use one of those mysterious Supra boxes to house the keys to the house that only Realtors have access to. They use their own lockboxes. And they give the power of the showings to the consumer (Buyer) directly. No agent required. The buyer can download their app and access any of their properties, on their schedule.

When buyer is ready to make an offer, they can fill it out directly on the Opendoor website. The form is so easy to understand that a child could navigate it. The form fills in the contract and meets the specific legal requirements for each state. In the past, this was where Realtors could be valuable. The contracts were so hard to understand, the regular consumer couldn’t manage them without help. Opendoor makes it possible to.  Kinda like Turbo Tax with taxes. Similar in that regard.

Additionally, Opendoor offers the buyers discounts for making offers to them directly.

Opendoor: “If you buy with Opendoor and finance with Opendoor Home loans (ODHL), you can save up to 1% of your home price via a combination of an ODHL lender credit and either a seller credit at closing (If buying directly) or a commission refund (If working with an Opendoor agent). Amounts vary.”

And yes, Opendoor has their own in-house mortgage company to finance your home as well.

Opendoor: “Finance with Opendoor Home Loans and get up to $1,000 credit at closing”

In a few years, legislation will catch up and it will start allowing eNotary services on closing documents. Covid is the vehicle for pushing this through. Notes, Deed of Trusts, even deeds will legally be signed electronically. Eventually, even the closing will be able to happen all online. Opendoor says they will handle this part through their app too.

The real estate iBuying ecommerce market is going to EXPLODE with Millennials and Zoomers and even some Gen X coming into the market. As a Millennial myself, I don’t like or want to deal with other people. We grew up behind the screen and we simple don’t know or understand the social skills it takes to communicate face to face. Not only that, we don’t want to. It’s a waste of time. We want to control everything and we want instant gratification.

Currently Opendoor is only active in 20 markets in the US. They plan to scale to 100 markets within a year. In the Charlotte market I work in, I have seen the closing attorney who handles the Opendoor closings scale from 1 employee to over 100 employees within 2 years.

**Comment from an Opendoor employee on the original post:** /u/casrox

I have some insight. Former employee. Basically the way opendoor works is by buying houses for less than market price and creating a floating inventory of product(houses) they they actual place in a holding subsidiary. Some of these houses are in hot markets so flip relatively easily, some are in colder markets so the price will be lower and it will take longer to sell. All these factors + condition of house and title issues come into play when they buy a house or sell a house at a certain price. They use a proprietary algorithm so don't know all the specifics as I wasn't a programmer and never messed with that. They make their money from a combination of closing fees, title work fees and profit off their house flipping. A seller/buyer can also bring their own realtor in, but will end up paying both opendoor fee and realtor fee. A lot of times they are able to make pretty decent profit on hot market houses that cover the losses they might suffer on a property they are having a hard time selling or that ends up being a complete wash due to unforseen circumstances(a house that had a murder happen in it and company was never informed for instance). They have well informed title teams with full curative and escrow staff in house due to their acquisition of title company named osnational. They were doing so much prior to acquisition that osnational created subsidiary companies that's exclusively worked on title and closings for opendoor. Due to this they are able to complete title work extremely fast and in some cases 24-48hr closings were not out of the question. They make money in other ways as well, such as doing outside contract title work for other companies and having a mortgage company built into business(opendoor mortgage) to increase the number of fingers they have in the proverbial pie. I never saw the numbers, as I was just a cog in the machine, but I can tell you the output/transactions increased month over month for many months prior to my leaving. The only real risk they run is of housing market does cool and they are stuck with too much inventory(just like of car market cooled and carving had too many cars and no buyers). With interest rates low tho they also get a steady income stream from refinances so not sure how big of a hit they would take if the cool off only lasted a couple months. I still do same job, just for another company, and will say the whole housing industry(buying/selling transactions) is booming. So much so that at the company I work for now, we are understaffed and 60hr+ weeks are not uncommon in order to keep up with massive volume. Opendoor flips primarily low-mid price range houses - which I assume is because it lowers the risk in case cool off period happens. The place I currently work does real high end boutique place(1.5mil-3mil is average price range) and we are slammed so I can assume pretty easily that opendoor is even more slammed. Finally, opendoor is also increasing to more and more markets. Since I left they have expanded to a handful of markets I know about and I'm sure others that they haven't disclosed publicly yet. Anyway, thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

**CONCERNS:**

**WHAT ABOUT THE CRASH COMING WE ARE IN A BUBBLE**

As someone who was in the industry during the recovery during the 2008 crash and who helped people avoid foreclosure firsthand, I can explain to you how what we see happening now is NOTHING like what we saw happen then.

The catalyst for the 2008 crash was the teaser ARM (Adjustable rate mortgage) rates that people were given for their mortgages. These rates fluctuated as such a volatile rate, that homeowners found themselves in situations where they could not pay their mortgage within a few years of buying. They did not understand the implications of the ARM loans when they signed on at a teaser, discounted interest rate and did not realize how drastically their mortgage payments would change once those rates adjusted.

The majority of home owners now are at a 2-5% FIXED, 30 year interest rate. Their mortgage payments are about 50% less than what the going rental rate is (at least in my market). People are literally saving thousands of dollars by owning their homes vs. renting. It’s cheaper.

Additionally, the 2008 crash happened because people were able to get mortgages by stating their income. There was no underwriting process that verified anything. They called them NINJA loans- No Income, No Job, No Assets. This simply can't happen anymore at any point after the 08 crash. Lenders verify income, debt and credit 3 times during underwriting now, even the day of closing. 

**WHAT ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND IMPENDING CLOSURES**

As someone who works in this industry, I am seeing firsthand that every lender is pushing the unpaid mortgage payments on the backend of the notes. This will allow people to avoid paying large lump sums up front.

Additionally, NO ONE IS UNDERWATER in their houses right now. So if, for some reason, a lender were to demand payment, the seller could simply sell and walk away. I haven’t seen a single lender do this. Not one.

**Comment: If I knew I was selling my property for less then fair market value, potentially tens of thousands of dollars, I’d suck it up and hire an agent.**

Everyone has their different requirements, desires and wants. Many have different ones. Grandma afraid of Covid and doesn't want showings? No Problemo! No Realtor interview process or dealing with them in the house either? Yes please! Closing happens on my watch at my desired time without crazy buyers in a moving truck barking up my ass? Sign me up! I control the entire transaction myself without relying on a Realtor to do it for me? Sold.

Some people don't care about a few thousand bucks if they know that the time, energy and stress was less. Those things have value too.

People don't realize that Money is merely a storage of value for work/time/energy.

Retail buyers require 10x the headache and energy. You may end up making $2k more on paper, but you've lost it all (and more) by the end of the transaction with the time and energy you had to spend to get there.

**ISN’T THIS JUST UBER FOR HOUSES**

Opendoor actually holds tangible assets unlike companies other than just their software like DoorDash, Uber, etc... 

Sidenote: I would wager that it's VERY likely that they eventually create a property management interface on their app that connects landlords with tenants for a fee and handles the Property Management side of things. This is an obvious next play. I can't confirm this, but it's just what I would be implementing of this were my company.

Did you miss the MU boat?

You don't want to buy AMD because WSB keeps saying to and this shit's cursed?

# tl;dr - $FORM

***Who the fuck?***

$FORM is a midcap company providing testing solutions for **semiconductor manufacturers**.They offer both products and services to test a variety of semiconductor products, including **cryogenic test equipment** for shit like quantum computing.

The semiconductor shortage is going to be around for a while and there's no one solution which will somehow fix it in one fell swoop.

So manufacturers need testing solutions if they are going to ramp up production.

***""Why should I know them?""***

You're not supposed to know, they aren't providing their services to YOU.  They are providing it to companies who make the damn semiconductors.

They held their IPO in 2003, since then they snapped up a bunch of smaller companies. MicroProbe, Cascade Microtech, FRT and ATT GMBH...

***""That doesn't mean anything to me, why should I spend my allowance on them?""***

I know this will piss you off but it's just good numbers in an industry with bonkers demand:

* Earnings Growth of 120.48% over the past 12 months
* Debt is 2% of their capital, with a YOY debt reduction of 16.13%
* Market Cap $3.84B, total annual revenue 2019 was $589mm, 2020 was $693MM gross profit margin of 41.5%.
* Doubled net income from 2019-2020.  Net income per share ALSO DOUBLED (no dilution)
* 89.56% institutional ownership with increasing positions each year.
* EPS has beaten the consensus forecast in every quarter since q2 2020.
* Last loss-making year was 2016.

***""But this website says they are overvalued!""***

Yes you fucking idiot. Of course they do.  All the numbers in a Discounted Cash Flow Valuation are based on a calculation of 0-5% annual growth linked to a company's debt.

They've already HAD 15% GROWTH YOY without a SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE and REDUCED THEIR DEBT.

159,$OSK (Oshkosh) to Infinity and Beyond (Part 1) 🚀🚀🚀,47,0.74,kissin_frogs,"I will be writing a series of DD posts for OSK. I have included TLDRs at the beginning of the post because I know we are all illiterate and lazy autists.

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor of any sort. This is my opinion, and it should not be taken as the word of God. Full disclosure, I am also fucking retarded, and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself.

TLDR (Full Series): Oshkosh is a boomer company with the Pilot, Rocket, and Jet Fuel to take off to infinity and beyond. It has the resources allowing it to dominate in its current market and propel it to the hottest market of them all (EV). It has a small downside, but its upside is so massive that the green dildo will tear my ass apart.

TLDR (Part 1): Oshkosh has excellent management in place with a great track record not only maintaining market share in its current sectors. It has grown every year since CEO has been put in place except for the Covid year. The OSK team has been working hard to get into the electric commercial vehicle space, and it looks promising.

Oshkosh’s Pilot will navigate us through the Stars and to the end of the Universe.

Oshkosh is a manufacturing conglomerate that provides products to access equipment, defense, fire & emergency, and commercial sectors. It was founded in 1917. It is a business that has been around longer than the boomers we know in our lives. Since it has survived multiple recessions and depressions, it will not be going anywhere.

The CEO of the company is Wilson R Jones, and he has been with the company since 2005 as general manager and in other roles. He has been the President/CEO since 2016, and the company has seen growth year after year. This guy is like a fucking wizard that only knows how to grow. The company did take a hit in 2020, and so did basically any companies that didn’t facilitate stay at home orders and the pain of Covid (eg. Zoom). 

During Wilson’s tenure, the stock price of OSK went from around $30 to $100. This growth in stock price isn’t just due to the markets being hotter than my neighbor next door. The revenue of OSK from 2016-2019 went from 6.28B  to 8.38B, and the EBIT of OSK went from $367M to $805M. During 2020 the revenue dropped to 6.82B, and the EBIT dropped to $406M. The company took a dip, but are we really going to hold that against him? He has a track record of performing, but you can’t do anything if there is a black swan event. ([Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSK/financials?p=OSK))

Wilson and the OSK team aren’t satisfied with its current business sectors. They have been building relationships and joint ventures to dominate the commercial EV space. Their notable partners entering the commercial EV space are [FORD](https://www.trucks.com/2018/03/06/oshkosh-ford-usps-mail-truck/) and [Microvast](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210204005668/en/Oshkosh-Corporation-partners-with-Microvast-to-strengthen-electrification-capabilities). Their first mission is to swoop in and steal the USPS contract from Workhorse, like how my wife’s boyfriend stole my wife away from me. I hate that fucker. I will talk more about this later on.

The management team has a strong track record, and they are only looking up and beyond just the moon. They will navigate us through the stars and into another galaxy.

In the next post, I will talk more about the valuation given to OSK and why it is a steal even if they didn’t plan on providing electric commercial vehicles for USPS.

160,BlackBerry is NOT a Meme Stock,5018,0.93,ramjaz,"It seems like people are finally starting to realize that BlackBerry, in fact, **is NOT a meme stock.**

You might ask, why is that? Well, here are a few of their partnerships and products that they're developing (and have *already* developed):

* Partnership with Amazon: On December 1st, [BB announced a multi-year agreement ](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform#:~:text=OverviewContact%20Us-,AWS%20and%20BlackBerry%20Join%20Forces%20to%20Accelerate,New%20Intelligent%20Vehicle%20Data%20Platform&amp;amp;amp;amp;text=SEATTLE%2C%20WA%20and%20WATERLOO%2C%20ON,%2C%20Amazon%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.)with AWS, which is Amazon’s cloud service business. The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.
* Partnership with Baidu: On January 25, BB announced the [expansion](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX® Neutrino® Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.). The milestones build on the company’s [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry-leading operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's ‘Apollo’ autonomous driving open platform.
* BlackBerry QNX: BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real-time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi, BMW, Subaru, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota, and Honda. NVIDIA is even building its AI self-driving platform off of BlackBerry’s QNX technology.
* BlackBerry IVY: [In addition to the QNX](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/) Operating System, their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy, which is a cloud-based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles.
* BlackBerry Spark: Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security, which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints. Through their UES, they plan on improving **cross-platform visibility, cyber threat prevention, and remediation,** while **simplifying administration.**

**Okay, so why is this important?**

1. BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 *million* vehicles.
2. BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers (Audi, BMW, Ford, etc) view data and insights on their vehicles. This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle, even like a problem with the sensors, **the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update.**
3. They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products. \*\*In the future, we could see a shift from hardware-driven vehicles to software-defined vehicles.\*\*
4. Not only are they focusing on this, but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the **HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise** [**Unmanaged/BYO use case**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/09/blackberry-achieves-highest-score-in-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-unmanaged-byo-use-case)**.**

Gartner Research (who published the study) even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare, IBM, and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors. In fact, NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack. And the stock price is still $12.

**The Sobering Part of this DD:**

After taking a look at their balance sheet, I can agree with the skeptics that they’re not raking in a ton of money right now, but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued, especially when compared to their competitors.

I mean, based on this information ALONE, the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now. BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion, with its competitors like Palantir, a software company that I’m sure you’ve heard other YouTubers talk about, hovering at 60 billion. And funny enough, Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity, just like BlackBerry. **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir, its stock price would be $110.**

**Final Thoughts:**

Here’s what the skeptics don’t realize though. They don’t realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition, and that boomers probably still think it’s a phone company. Well, it’s not.

With their partnership with Amazon, Baidu, their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark, BlackBerry IVY, and their QNX operating system for vehicles, it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry’s **future growth**.

Maybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now, maybe then it’ll be taken much more seriously. **But only, once people realize that it’s not a meme stock.**

EDIT: Well, WSB mods have banned me for linking my video. Oh well.

EDIT 2: By the grace of u/DeepFuckingValue, mods reduced my sentence for being a good boy.

Also, I forgot to mention this: to all the retards out there saying “BB is not PLTR” lemme let you in on something.

**BlackBerry’s Fiscal 2020 Revenue: $1.1B**
**Palantir’s Fiscal 2020 Revenue: $1.05B (ESTIMATE)**

And again...

**BlackBerry’s Market Cap: $7.3B**

**Palantir Market Cap: $55.6B**

161,"Exposing Sundial growers, ticker SNDL",364,0.83,jhuntinator27,"Please put up with my smooth brain analysis, here. Like many of you, I consider myself a connoisseur and producer of modern aut. I am autist in my own right, and as such I have spent hours looking over the shady financial reporting of this shady company.

Of course, I am in no way certified to give financial advice to anyone. I am simply concerned that this company, if it is really fraudulent, is going to destroy investor's savings, and I think it's only fair that I express these concerns.

I'll try to keep this concise, and not miss any details, because there is a lot going on here, and it really does get complicated.

Fair warning, my decision has been to invest in some put options on February 11th before the price started dropping, and it's up to you whether you want to as well. I give no advice on such an investment, but I personally think I made the best choice, and I know for a fact that their financials do not add up, so this is more to call attention to anyone who might be convinced to invest just how bad of a decision that would be...

Here are some reasons:

**A. OBVIOUS SHILLS**

I won't name names, but obvious shills like [u/Masternewworldorder](https://www.reddit.com/u/Masternewworldorder/) have been trying to pump up the stock price through a social media campaign and ride the coattails of the GME debacle. I would not just simply post this guy's name on here if I had any other way to show how all 18 posts on his account are about hyping Sundial using the GME fiasco as a model for doing so. He even mentions GME, calling SNDL the ""next"" SNDL. To you, buddy, if you're doing what everybody knows you're doing, and the SEC finds out, you and those you work for or with will probably be arrested. Not only that, but his page clearly breaks a few rules on the sub. Pump & Dump most likely, advertisement, market manipulation, etc.

If you're just riding the hype wagon, you should really choose another company to hype up. If I'm correct in my math, they don't have the funds to operate through the quarter, nor can they get a loan to continue operations. I'll discuss their lies about their debt at the bottom of the page. I'll just say for now, it's my belief that they are either doing a pump and dump, or using share capital to have enough cash that they can file for bankruptcy and walk away with cash and hand.

**B. DISGRACEFUL FINANCIALS**

Financial reports must comply with a ton of SEC and FTC laws about documents that they have to file. This is to protect those who would wish to invest their money so as to be protected from the sort of activities that would destroy them, and any trust in the stock market that they had. Maybe I'm cynical, but that last part is the most important. SEC wants trust, because then they have a functional system.

A company that is traded on an American stock exchange must fulfill certain requirements regarding their financial reports, that usually allow for an exception in the case of international filers, but Canada is very similar in this regard, though perhaps notable from this stock, that's not the case at all \[1\]

1. Their most up to date report shows **$500 million** in share capital with **$70 million equity.** (I believe that's Canadian $)
2. leveraged against the share capital is a **$500 million** accumulated deficit, up **$140 million** from the year before. Coincidentally, their **debt** obligations are **down $140 million** from the year before as well. This suggests they are using issued stock and general market manipulations to pay off their debt. They say that the issuance of more stock is for a few things, depending on which report you read. I can't find them all, but trust me, [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001766600&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001766600&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40), it's in here somewhere. They say it's for purchasing of new properties, or maybe operation activities, but they never clearly state that they are paying off their debt with the new stock. I don't know if that's illegal or not, but it's definitely untrustworthy.
3. For the 9 month period from January 1st, 2020 to September 30th 2020, they had **$12 million in revenue**, which cost them **$10 million to sell**, but they also lost **\~ $20 million to inventory obsolescence**, and **$60 million to asset impairment**. As an investor, I would like to know why that happened, but their reporting makes absolutely no mention of it in their section **Risk Factors** on all **F-3** filings \[2\]. They may not have to include that, but again, you should really be given the opportunity to find out, and any company acting with the foresight to know stockholder trust is important - any company who wants to succeed - will make these things abundantly clear.

**C. LETTER FROM THE AUDITOR**

This is the icing on the cake, and which verifies to me that there is so much more going on here than I could even understand. The auditor is paid by the company to look at their financials thoroughly to see if the condensed info meets standards, and fairly describes the company's information to the potential stockholders.

This auditor has time and again given them the same letter more or less, stating that their financials show that **the company has been acting in breach of their debt covenant**, which is the most evidence of a serious issue here. They also say that various other issues in Sundial's reporting gives them concern that **the company should not, and probably will not be able to continue operating** the way that they are \[3\]. This is all I need to know, really. And why any speculative raise in their market capitalization on the stock market gives me serious concern about the current state of our economic system. It's examples like these which destroy investor confidence, and lead to seriously tough times. Shorting this position is **not just profitable**, it's necessary to **save the soundness of our economy**, in my opinion.

**D. SUSPICIOUS REASONS FOR FULFILLMENT OF DEBTS**

If securities on an exchange are linked to the equity of a firm that goes bankrupt and cannot operate, then all that money goes out of investors hands, and into the hands of debtors, or is liquidated and given to the preferred stock holders.

Luckily for the executives and majority shareholders of Sundial Growers, Inc, they have a tiny little clause hidden in one of their reports which says that all liquidated funds must first be given to preferred stock holders before any is given to issued common stock traded on any exchange \[4\].

This is important, because they have clearly stated that **they can issue indefinite numbers of preferred and common stock**, and that **preferred stock gets first right** in the case of liquidation. Essentially, they can use the extra stock issuance to dilute costs and trick investors into thinking **EPS** is getting closer to that **above 0** marker (total earnings continues to drop further every statement), while also separately securing any cash left by issuing more preferred stock to themselves upon liquidation so that you, the investor, **get absolutely nothing** while they get any proceeds from going bankruptcy, possibly even millions.

**E. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE COMPANY EVEN**

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000110465920114508/a20-32923\_1sc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000110465920114508/a20-32923_1sc13g.htm)

Some guy named **Ryan Dunfield**, who is mentioned nowhere else in their financials, received 25,000,000 shares in preferred stock for absolutely zero dollars in cost to him, well, actually, it's that Ryan Dunfield gets **25 million share**s,\[redacted company name\]**,**\[redacted company name\]**, and 1920576 ALBERTA LTD** all get shares as well. However, these are 3 companies of which **Ryan Dunfield is the president and/or CEO**. Ryan Dunfield got **1/10 of all stocks** available, not to mention voting power from these stocks, without paying any money for them, This was filed very recently too, It was filed after the last known financial report on September 30th. I haven't calculated all of the other people's issuance of preferred stock either, but this is definitely suspect to me. These sorts of dealings are **being done all the time by this company**, but they drown out the sec filings by naming **every single filing under the exact same document name**, so it's damn near impossible to keep track of any of it.

**F. NUMBERS DONT ADD UP**

It's also convenient that they just issued common stock to fill the company with cash, and actually **did away with all of their debt.** If that is to be believed (sorry, I can't find any proof in their filings), then they are a rarity among companies to have done so **and maintained a $600 million cash reserve**. Not to mention that the **$500 million accumulated deficit**, **the $100 million total debt** and **accounts payable**, along with a **$90 million operating loss** all is somehow accounted for by **$18 million in financing income** (stock issuance I presume) before September 30th of last year, and supposedly **$100 million in stock issuance** if you read any related news, and less than **$200 million in illiquid assets**. Honestly, I don't know how these numbers can turn **$20 million cash into $600 million cash in 3 months**.

However they managed to pull that off this year, I'm pretty sure that they will continue to leverage this as a deficit against their Share capital. If that's the case, they now have **$600 million share capita**l with **$690 million in deficit** leveraged against that.

I'm not sure if anyone is aware of this, but if you owe a bank money, you can't simply say ""Sorry, this isn't actually a debt, it's a deficit"". It doesn't work that way, and **reporting it that way is serious fraud**. They may not actually be prosecuted for this fraud, but it still exists, and it is damaging to those who would invest in it.

**G. SHOW THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE SEC WE CAN HANDLE OURSELVES**

The institutions have not invested anything in this company, and I suspect it has everything to do with their financials. I bet you if a company with a large amount of institutional ownership operated the way this company does, then the SEC would be their to protect the institutions so fast.

Instead, it's left up to the little guys, who don't have enough money to pay Treasurers from the shady San Francisco political bubble $800k in speaking fees, to fend for themselves. We all take the most risk in the market because we're targeted by scammers, immeasurably larger competition, and indifferent regulators. In my opinion, this **short position against Sundial would be exactly what we need to show regulators what it's like to do their job.**

By the way, I'm pretty suspicious about the timing of this sudden increase in cash, given that I'm pretty sure tax season, and financial reporting season are very soon. Showing really large capital on their filings (which actually disappear the day after) would help secure them a new loan to save their ass. It's no wonder why a small company with 90% of their capital lost would want their financials looking a bit crisper on their sec filings.

**H. MAGIC NUMBER**

If all of this is lost on you, at least realize that they potentially have a $690 million deficit if my math is right.

EDIT: I don't have any positions in the company expiring today, nor do I think them staying on will stop the inevitability of my position making money. I could exit it now at a profit if I wanted to. It's a principled matter at this point, and more of a warning about some misinformation I've seen posted here regarding their financials. Just check the sec filings if you want to make your own decision. Don't trust what I say, trust the facts.

EDIT 2: I think I actually found some proof of price manipulation and insider trading. In the picture attached, you can clearly see that $5C for SNDL randomly bounced up in price midday on January 27th, two days before a registered offering. Viewing the $5C as opposed to a lower value call allows you to see the most highly volatile moments, since the less extreme side of option chains  are often more easily obscured by normalization of daily trading

162,Carvana Ooh Na-Na: The WeWork of Used Automobiles,45,0.92,swoosh112,"Profile:

We're here to talk about Carvana. You probably heard of it and your friend Jeff who recently bought his Subie WRX off Carvana won't stop telling all his friends how seamless the process was. For those who don't know;  Carvana performs almost all the functions a physical dealer would offer: buying and selling cars, accepting trade-ins, and financing purchases except they're strictly an online-only used-car retailer. With so many online used car e-commerce choices and alternatives; Carvana's advantage is that they make their process as contactless as possible and they take away the hassle of haggling with a sleazy salesman. Carvana does not allow their customers to test drive the vehicle before they purchase but they do offer a 7 day return policy for any reason with some caveats. Carvana will deliver your purchase for free if you're within 75 miles of its physical location or they will charge you anywhere from $250-$1000 by a 3rd party delivery company. One of their gimmick is that they have physical car vending kiosks in 24 locations where customers can use a token to pick up their car like one of those old gumball machines you used to see as a kid.

CVNA was trading about $80-$100 a share pre-covid and reached as low as $22 during the peak of the pandemic. CVNA IS now trading at its ATH hovering around $290-$300 a share. They have a market cap of $49.74B which is bigger than notable online e-commerce giants such as $CHWY($43B), $EBAY($42B), $W($29B), $KMX($20B) and $ETSY($27B). Carvana have been consistently losing money and have yet to turn a profitable quarter. They lose approximately $1500 on every car sold last year, taking overhead costs into account. The company is being evaluated like a Tech SAAS company but it's really a WeWork for cars.

[Financials](https://preview.redd.it/wks9vxvyuzg61.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd4168d9a3cb6e2cd32b0a3588d5f8a54d61b1c6)

Economy:

You might've already heard that used car prices have been going up due to the constraints of manufacturers producing new cars coupled along with people having extra money from not going on vacation and also the additional income from the government's stimulus checks. This means Carvana is making a higher premium when they sell but they're also paying a lot more to attain inventory. The purchased cars will sit in inventory and will get continuously markdown until they are sold. In order to make space, Carvana will even sell at narrow to negative margins just to keep churning through inventory. With the influx of demand, it is impossible for quality control and customer service to keep up with the momentum of increasing sales. Take a look at their BBB rating of 1.4/5 with 882/1385 complaints coming from the past year. Tech companies are allowing their employees to work from home and cars are becoming less of a necessity unless you're in the suburbs. Chances are if you're looking for a car, you'll wait for the market prices to come back to normal and continue to use your ol faithful 2011 Honda accord or 2012 Ford Focus as there is really no rush with sheltering in place still in effect.

Shady Practice:

Carvana is family owned and is being run by Ernest Garcia II and his son Ernest Garcia III. Ernest Garcia II is the majority stake holder of Carvana and played a part as a straw borrower in a real estate scandal back in 1990 with Charles Keating and Lincoln Savings and Loans. He is also the owner and chairman of DriveTime which is a company that specializes in selling used vehicles with their demographic being  customers who can only afford cars with sub-prime loans. Ernest then went to start Carvana as a subsidiary of Drive Time which is basically Drive Time but for millennial and gen z because who doesn't want to pick up their vehicle from a vending machine right? Carvana is not a used car marketplace, its a bank that preys on unexpecting victims by deceiving them into loans they cannot afford. The Garcias were also sued for insider trading when CVNA stock was trading at its low in the height of the pandemic. Stock prices fell during Covid and they took advantage of the artificial stock price and offered shares for sales to their private investors even though they were not in dire need for money.  The Garcias knew the stock would rebound as they have full disclosure of the health and financials of the company, and were not facing a liquidity issue of any sort. Fast forward to now with CVNA sitting its ATH, Ernest Garcia II have been dumping his shares starting at the end of October and have been steadily offloading over 2 billion dollars worth of shares.

&#x200B;

[Recent Insider Trades](https://preview.redd.it/y4b1u9q4g2h61.jpg?width=1426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8e648e3b4c4e09a825b075452004a96f8306ef1)

TLDR; CVNA is a shady bank disguised in the form of a used car e-commerce. The owner have a history of engaging in white collar crimes. The company have not been profitable but they obtain an absurd evaluation compared to their peers. Take a look at insider trading and you can see that the owner have been dumping his shares.

Summation:

Buy your Puts for its upcoming earnings or whatever date you feel comfortable but beware this POS stock is being backed by the likes of Wells Fargo and Citi Group for those juicy sub prime loans and who knows who else the Garcias have on their payroll. I didn't even get into the topic of their competitors such as KMX, VRM, Lotz but yeah do your own research instead of listening to some stranger on the internet. Peace.

Edit: Ernest Garcia III sold 6.8 Mill shares since the end of Oct and coincidentally he filed his form 13G today and it states he has 16 Mill shares outstanding which is 18% of CVNA shares. That means he dumped about 30% of his position since the end of October.

163,$PLTR the pinnacle of earnings pressure and why you should buy/hold.,195,0.88,AnotherAnon2330,"This is my first write up I’ll be doing, I know that this account is new but I have never bothered to hop on reddit until recently. My goal with this is to shed light on PLTR’s current situation and the likely bounce back it’ll have soon. Please forgive any ape like sentence structuring, I haven’t had my daily crayon. 

Firstly let’s talk about why PLTR is plummeting right now, the potential it has going forward and why buying now is probably one of the last chances with entry at a heavy discount.

Some useful notes (all of these values are intra-day and were grabbed as of writing time, they may have changed):

*Current price: $31.99

*Lowest point this week was today: $31.99

*Highest point this week: $39.15

*Highest point all time: $44.45

Currently PLTR has been dropping HARD in value from the recent highs it hit and somehow the bleeding hasn’t stopped. People have been shorting and selling this stock left and right out of panic that the earnings, long weekend and the lockout will cause a major dip in the price. We all know how the markets work, panic and sell first, think second. Now, here’s why the long term benefits outweigh the short term panic.

PLTR has such a unique offering compared to some of the stocks “booming” right now and we already know when they receive new partnerships the price peaks above $38+. The lowest point has been hit now, the stock likely will spike if earnings are good even if it does not immediately, we can expect another partnership to make the price boom.

It’s also worth noting analysts that aren’t as stupid as me are setting the price target to at-least $40-55. There’s also articles speculating the earnings will be better then the previous quarter report. 

All in all please do your own DD and research before blinding trusting me.

Link to article speculating earnings will be fine/better:
https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/palantirs-pltr-top-line-shape-132101801.html

I truly believe anyone investing and holding now will see HUGE reward coming into next week or the week after.

My position:
PLTR/29 units at $32.02.

Thanks for coming to my ape talk.

EDIT: To anyone asking about my new account I can’t reply in the comments due to auto mod. So I’ll leave this notice here for now, I joined Reddit after WSB blew up after GME. I wanted to remain anonymous so that’s why my name is so generic. I only expected to lurk but I couldn’t help myself.

EDIT 2: Someone asked why I only have 29 shares, it’s called being broke. Trust me if I had the money I would be investing more into this.

EDIT 3: My thoughts on the lockup expiry detailed: Since the lockup expires 3 days after the earnings report there will likely still be a jump in price right after earnings before preemptively dropping again. Likely some institutes will sell for profits but I doubt many will following a -15% week.

164,Institutional ownership of $PLTR up 50% in Feb in the run up to earnings,390,0.92,Spa2018,"EDIT: Changed flair to DD. Apologies to the Mods if it's not acceptably thorough. And wow! Thank you for the awards, my first on Reddit!

I've been invested in Palantir since it DPO'd last year, originally bought in at just below the $10 mark, and made some good money in a couple of accounts after its first run up. I'm convinced the stock is going to hit $100 at some point (obviously I hope it'll be this year, but as a long term play, it doesn't matter too much).

I've been keeping an eye on the institutional ownership of Palantir here: [https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr](https://fintel.io/so/us/pltr)

At the end of last year, there were about 193 institutional investors holding shares of Palantir, for a total of 12.39% of the float. During January, the number of institutions steadily increased, but the percentage that they held really didn't go up that much. It wasn't until February that institutional ownership passed the 13% mark.

Today, we're at 371 institutional owners (344 yesterday), and the institutional ownership has shot up past 18%.

Earnings for $PLTR is Tuesday before market open (note: the market is closed on Monday, so today's the last day before earnings if you're waiting to jump in). A lot of people tend to sell in the run up to earnings, as the hype is a good opportunity to take profits. What I'm seeing today is that the institutions are basically buying the dip. They missed their chance to take advantage of a crazy IPO, but they're not going to miss the chance to make money off a company that is most likely going to fly in the next 12 months.

This year has seen positive news every week for Palantir, and I think that even if the earnings report itself isn't amazing, the guidance for the year ahead is going to make the stock fly.

That said here’s why GEVO is nice and I’m holding it for the long term.

GEVO are going to be making carbon neutral jet fuel. Pretty nifty coz I’m pretty sure people are already paying extra to airlines to fly lower carbon flights, and I’m sure governments all around the world will be heavily incentivising low carbon footprint fuels.

They’ve secured funding now for their Net-Zero 1 project which will use entirely renewable energy sources to refine 45MGPY of bio-fuels which have a net zero carbon footprint. They already have in place contracts to sell 48MGPY at 1.5 billion over the life of the contracts. After this they’re looking to introduce projects net zero 2 and 3 as well as a bunch of other cool, useful shit that lets us revolutionise the world without reinventing planes and shit.

Options start trading 3 days after IPO, so with the holiday it's this coming Tuesday 2/16 

*Edit: the meme strike will be $69p 4/20. JK, the chain at single dollars and that date don't exist, so I think $60p June is fine.* 

**The Financials:** From Jan 2020 to September 2020 (I mean, like last year, the year of basically the highest possible growth as everyone was stuck at home)

* Total Revenue of $376.6 million
* Bumble App Revenue of $231.5 million
* Badoo App and Other Revenue of $145.1 million
* Net loss of $(84.1) million, respectively, with a net loss margin of 22.3%
* Adjusted EBITDA of $98.9 million, representing Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 26.3%.
* Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.0 million
* Free Cash Flow of $(4.7) million

We can't use P/E because there is no earnings. The net loss margin >20% is quite impressive for a company that really shouldn't have any expenses (not that much advertising... it's all by word of mouth really). That total valuation to revenue is 40x. Facebook's is only around 9x.

**Gamification of meeting people**: This is where r/wsb and Grindr gets it right. There's a certain addictiveness of these two because you never know when you're going to hit a 200 bagger with OTM calls on TSLA or get a 2 bagger on your face (both great success). When using all kinds of dating apps, especially Bumble, there are a lot of speed limits.

That speed limit? Well, their tagline: women responding first. I've asked my online sister about this and she says most women will not answer first because after the initial high of matching, they come back to normal realization much sooner. Men would always want to initiate and keep the conversation because of possible tits, but women would think ""oh, why do I want to meet this guy again? He's not going to provide for me financially, and I can just use a lightsaber.""

**Diminishing returns**: All the dating apps aren't in the matching business. They're in the data business. Data is driven by continuous activity, even if it's by only a small portion of users. Because of the above restriction, they're severely limiting activity. Most users are men, and by cutting out a large base of activity generation (even the possibility of saying hi and dreaming), Bumble is limiting activity and time spent on the app. It's like r/wsb. Most retards who got burned by GME aren't going to come back, no matter how good the DD will be.

**Social Networking?**: No. LinkedIn is already good enough to polish my helmet. I personally don't want anyone to find me professionally through a dating website. This is one of the arguments to its high valuation, but honestly it's dead on arrival.

Also, why would I need to meet someone? Mom knows how crispy to fry my tendies. She always gives me the tendies, and sometimes I give one back to her in return.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lig3lx/bmbl_i_hate_the_stock/,1613180204.0
167,The future of semiconductors and why Intel is poised to win the war,4,0.52,tecladovoador,"While you incestuous smooth brained degenerates have been getting fiddled by wall street, always late to plays, ""hodling"" (this is fucking retarded) literal trash like weed stonks GME and feeding overvalued tech companies that never turned a profit. While this has been happening intel has been smoothly bringing in nearly 100 billion $ in revenue.

Yeah Intel is not flashy and is currently suffering from its lack of memeticness but it is an absolute titan in the biggest most valuable industry in the world. Fucking semiconductors. You know what that shit does? CPUs baby, basically everything electronic needs this. This industry is the foundation, the building block of all of tech.

Guess what, INTC designs their own chips but more importantly they produce them. Listen carefully this part is important apes, Intel is the only western fab that has any relevance. Intel's competition in production is TSMC. A fucking Taiwanese company, which basically means at any moment it could be a Chinese company (In case any of you decide to look at world affairs and geopolitics). Intel is red, white and blue, an American stonk. Ill let you guys mull that over in your big brains.

Literally go look at any major cap tech company and look at the parabolas that have been formed (AMD, NVDA included). Parabolas most of you didnt enjoy. Well Intel is a parabola you can still enjoy. Im posting today as it is up 2% and has just passed 60$ an important milestone if you care about shit like technical analysis and the Wizard of Oz. I also know you guys dont like to buy things when they are in the red because you have simple circuit breaker brains, but Intel actually literally cant go tits up. Buy calls if you are a degenerate and you are (IV is low so super cheap still), alternatively just buy and hold and in a few months its 50-100% up.

Most of you guys and girls dont know what a 10k or a 10q is but if you have any curiosity go read the balance sheet and income statement of Intels last quarter. This is the titan of titans, its finances are superb. Low debt, high equity, large and growing revenues in the most valuable and ever growing industry in the world. But thats enough fundamentals for WSB.

Intel is still under the radar of most degens and the euphoria of the current market. It will gain favor, and it will gain favor soon. Do yourself a favor and buy INTC now and not at 100$ when its literally 30$ over all time high.

I didnt mention it, but there is a chip shortage, and Patrick Gelsinger (one of the smartest people in silicon valley) is taking over this giant on the 15th. I guarantee this stonk will moon, might even break the trillion dollar barrier in the next year.

Im long INTC with 1700 shares and 500 April 18th 80$ strike calls.

PS: I told one of my girlfriends husband to buy INTC but all he wants to do is HODL sun fucking dial. I guess some things never change.

168,My ~$50k YOLO on $TRVG and why it'll 🚀🚀🚀 to the 🌕,1013,0.86,double_a_mtl,"You already bought and sold your tickets to tendie town on $TLRY, $APHA, $GME, $AMC and all the other memes of the last month?

Sitting here, scratching your head trying to figure out what's the next play that'll 🚀your portfolio to the 🌕?

I had started initiating a position in this earlier this month, then /u/dhsmatt2 posted his own yolo on it. Confirmation bias confirmed! We’re off to the 🌕See his post here: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lien2t/tendies_is_spelled_trivago_250000_yolo/)

$TRVG is now back above $1bn market cap. It was worth nearly 3x as much a year ago.

Expedia is the majority shareholder in the company, so it's definitely not going to disappear.

This quarter the company announced that they managed to cut expenses by 71% versus 2019, bringing their overall cash burn down to about 10 million dollars.

They're sitting on about 250-300 million in cash on hand, so that's enough for them to last **5 years** with out having to grow sales at all. 🚀🚀🚀

They're a MUCH leaner business than they were coming into the pandemic, and they'll be primed to benefit once sales start to increase coming out of this. 🚀🚀🚀

They aren't an Airline with billions of dollars in planes sitting on the ground, so they'll be able to pivot into profitability very quickly. 🚀🚀🚀

The ""Worst case"" scenario here is that Expedia buys out the remaining shares. If this were to happen, they won't be buying them back for less than 6-8$.

Shares have been trending upwards since they announced earnings earlier this week.

Call premiums are pricing in IV of 200%+, so this is definitely a play where you buy shares.

At the current valuation, we're getting to buy a company that normally generates a billion dollars in revenues for a cash adjusted price of $800 mil

Even more beautiful, the majority of their revenues were previously generated by companies Expedia owns. Booking holdings (Expedia's competitor) has been increasing the amount of business they've been sending to Trivago and as a % of business, Booking holdings has been referring more in 2020 vs 2019.

Liability note: I am not a financial advisor, do your own DD. This is a stock I like a LOT

TLDR: Trivago's biggest client is Expedia group, Trivago's biggest shareholder is Expedia. Booking holdings, Expedia's competitor has been sending $TRVG more business. Costs are down 71% year over year, so a ""new"" leaner company coming out of the pandemic, with LOTS of pent-up travel demand. Shares are cheap, but won't be for long. In the time I typed this up, they rose from $2.80 to just under 3$.

Position: 16 000 shares, 20x 5$ march calls, 10x April 5$ calls 50x July 5$ calls.

169,NrdRage’s Friday DD: There’s still one meme stock that’s not dead yet. I present to you The Curious Case of Benjamin Butto....err Black Berry. ($BB),329,0.89,NrdRage,"Listen up reta.....err, I mean memelords.   I know we’ve all moved on from the meme era into the weed era (and  hopefully people stick around that one due to the fundamentals for a  while, but if not....) and soon to be a redux of the vehicle era, but  there’s one meme stonk we need to have a real, honest heart-to-heart  about (and hey, it even ties into cars):  Let’s talk about Blackberry  ($BB)

# First,  let’s get some misconceptions out of the way: 

&#x200B;

Blackberry was never a  short squeeze stonk, even though it ended up getting roped in with the  other squeezers we were denied squozing  because of Wall Street cheating.  A lot of people thought it was and  that’s simply not the case.  Blackberry was, is, and always will be, a  phoenix rising from the ashes story, nostalgia peppered with  functionality.  You know, kind of like how you sometimes go watch some  classic porn to beat off to and don’t stop to think about the fact that  the actress is now in her 60’s and probably has super saggy tiddies.

Next  misconception:  It’s not a Boomer mobile phone company.  They don’t  make phones anymore – phones that are branded with their logos are made  by another company that pays licensing for the logo and some of the  patents.  Blackberry sold all their mobile patents months ago.

Third misconception:  No matter how much we ask,  they’re never changing their name back to Research in Motion so that we  can talk about Rim-jobs.  Sorry, just isn’t going to be a thing.

So  what are they?  It’s simple really:  They’re now an enterprise level  software security company.  When you think about it, it’s not such a big  pivot, given that their security encryption in their heyday was so  powerful that they ended up having to set up offices in certain nations  because it was impossible to crack and ran afoul of certain  international laws.

# Let’s take a dive into the financials before we get into the story:

At the time of this writing, BB is a 7 billion dollar  company with shares trading in the $12.50 range.  Even after the meme  war collapse, they’re still worth double what they were when the ball  dropped in New York City with absolutely nobody watching in person and  everybody at home wondering why even Anderson Cooper was using an autotuner.   They generate a hair over a quarter billion dollars in revenue each  quarter over the last year and in 2020 had a negative EPS of about 32  cents a share as they retooled, though they trimmed that to .23 cents a  share for their last quarterly earnings report.  They have about a  billion dollars in cash on hand and receivables, and they have about  half a billion dollars in debt.  It’s not a great fiscal outlook there,  but it’s certainly manageable for a growth company (which is what they  presently are).

# Where do they make their money?

Almost  half of their revenue is legacy income from selling endpoint management  and secure communications licensing.  A third of their revenue comes  from licensing their patents.  Oh, they also own Cylance, for you IT  help desk monkeys.

**That shit’s pretty boring, not gonna  lie.**  Your wife’s boyfriend might find it interesting, but only because  he can use it to laugh at you that you know this shit.  But the rest?   The rest is where things get interesting.  Blackberry Radar is a fleet  management solution, and the most interesting thing is....well, for  that, we have to go back in time for a moment:

# (Wayne’s World flashback/dream noises)….

July 29th,  2017.  Las Vegas Nevada.  50,000 of the world’s most feared hackers  descend upon Sin City for a weekend of debauchery, drinking, and talking  about all the new and interesting ways they found to break shit or in  general cause chaos - aka DefCon 25, which was NOT cancelled, contrary to what you might have been told.  A young hacker from Wisconsin positively stuns  everybody at a panel by revealing how it is that he found he could  effectively hack almost every late model vehicle on the road that  possessed connected features – from range and while the vehicles are in  motion – using.....music  theory.  It’s an absolutely stunning revelation, something matched only  by how terrifying the implications of it are.  And all anybody needed  was a $300 RF modulation tool.  Using this, he found he could take  control of every mass produced  car on the market except those made by Volkswagen Group and Tesla, and  those only because they had randomized frequencies they used.  This guy  fucked.  This process was so dangerous that, for one of the only times  in DefCon’s history, they didn’t publish the how-to publicly.  Oh, and a  team from a then relatively unknown EV company in China called $NIO won  the car hacking capture the flag tournament in less dramatic fashion.   If you didn't hear about any of this, it's because you were too much of a square to be there.  Sucks to be you, chump.  Something had to be done.

# Enter Blackberry

I’ll  spare you all the things that have happened since then, but what you  need to know is this:  Blackberry came up with a solution to defend  against this and a myriad of other problems (not to mention Europoor  compliance in the form of ISO 26262) not to mention autonomous security  - and their security software suite (QNX) is now on almost every new  car rolling off a factory line today.  This software is also critical  for EV’s, because it controls battery management ECU’s (that’s the shit  that makes it so you don’t have to drop 10 grand on a new power plant every 2 years).  Or, for those of you with IQ’s of 60:  Computer make car gooder.

# OK, so that’s cool.  But how does this get me TENDIES, man?  How much can these guys make?

They’re  coy about this and won’t give hard numbers, but there are ways we can  estimate what they’re pulling.  But to do that, we need to go back in  history again, and take a look at a stock nobody cares about

# (More Wayne’s World noises)

Enter:   Nuance Communications ($NUAN).  You’ve probably never heard of these  guys, but you and almost everybody you know has used their products at  some point.  They used to be best known for their Dragon Naturally  Speaking software suite, which your grandparents who decided they were  too old to figure out how to use a fucking keyboard bought so that they  could talk to their computer and send you messages that you hated  getting unless it came with a 20 dollar  bill, but which they thought you cherished forever.   However, at some  point around 2010, IBM – whom the Nuance CEO at the time was close  friends with the management of, literally just \*gave\* about 125 patents  around voice recognition to Nuance thinking that they were worthless.   Nuance took these patents and – for a brief moment – became one of the  coolest techs on the planet, because their tech is what made Apple’s  Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, Samsung’s whatever it was  called and a billion other voice recognition platforms work.  That is,  until Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Steve Ballmer, and everybody else Nuance  was dumb enough to trust to let look under the hood of their secret  sauce came along and all stole the IP to made their own platforms, leaving  Nuance rotting in a hole in the desert.  But one of the really cool  things Nuance expanded into before they went full retard was  they bought a couple of companies around 2013 or so– Tweddle and some  other company I can’t be bothered to look up – and got into the  connected car space.  At one point, Nuance’s Dragon Drive virtual  assistant was in every new car made by 9 of the world’s top 10 auto  makers.  

# OK, dude, my wife’s boyfriend is asking me to bring him a beer.  Can you speed this along?  What does this matter?

It  matters because we can look at what $NUAN was getting in licensing for  putting their virtual assistant in these vehicles, and use that data to  extrapolate an estimate of what $BB is getting for their software.  With  just their 9 car makers at their back, they were generating over 300  million dollars a year – and that was almost a decade ago, and just for  something that would tell you where to pick up your Down’s Syndrome  medication. Add a premium for security, include all the auto makers,  carry the one, smoke a bowl to help you concentrate, adjust for  inflation.....

This  is a market worth about...oh, roughly 750 million dollars a year for  Blackberry on the conservative side once they actually start charging a  market rate for this product.   Right now, they’re adopting the same  go-to strategy Microsoft has been employing with Azure, which is to  basically GIVE it away in order to gain market share and penetration,  and then send Fat Tony to collect once the car maker is reliant on it.  Plus  all the other stuff we already glossed over because it’s boring as  shit.   Applying the average multiple of earnings for cybersecurity  firms out there, their lack of competition in the space, etc. And you  come up with a market cap valuation target of....oh,  roughly between 45 and 50 billion dollars once they’re firing on all  cylinders.  And they don’t have to worry about Google or Apple throwing  10,000 engineers at this to make a competing product, because it’s just  not worth it to them, so they’re largely gonna get left alone.  

Or, by using maths....a  share price of somewhere in the neighborhood of $87.50.  Give or take  10 bucks.  Make it 15 to the downside, just to be safe.

# Yeah man!  Cool.  So I’m in.  It’s gonna go to that by like, Friday or something?

An enterprise level cybersecurity company with a sub 10 billion dollar valuation is basically unheard of in this century.   But this is not a burn play where you’re gonna  get 50% gains every day with no work.  It’s a company that’s going to  have to melt up to that.  It still won’t be to that point this time next  year. 

BUT....that  doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a great story.  It just means that this  isn’t something you do a 0DTE YOLO on and expect to get something out  of.  And making an Avengers meme about it isn’t going to send it to the  moon.  This is something you buy and stash in a musty corner of your  portfolio so you can tell your Boomer parents that you’re being  responsible with your investing and you were just joking about betting  your inheritance on weekly FD’s for shitty online dating sites where the women have to talk to your sorry ass first.   Oh, and it’ll make the lambo you buy with the money from this safer.

Because I know it matters, here are 69 rockets so you apes understand what all this meant.

.....no, there aren't going to be any rockets.  I lied.

Disclosures/Positions:  I am long $BB, holding 100,000 shares @ $7.67 average and another 5000 January 2022 5c’s.

With the SAFE/MORE act currently getting passes in congress and Schumer making moves towards legalization, US MSOs are getting closer than ever to being listed on NASDAQ and when institutional investors have access to the US cannabis industry... All hell breaks loose. The largest names right now are Green Thumb, Trulieve, Curaleaf, and Cresco Labs. No need to get smoked gambling on Canadian Cannabis companies, US MSOs have a huge advantage and are already established across the country for the moment legalization comes. I'm passing yall the boof on this one. Do with this information what you will. I currently have positions in Green Thumb and Curaleaf.

edit: If you're stuck with a shit broker and don't have access to OTC market and you can still profit off US MSOs with the ETF (MSOS)!

171,$OPEN Opendoor DD – From a Realtor Industry Insider,150,0.75,krush0910,"Edit: adding 🚀🚀🚀🏠📈🌕

Edit: Cathie Wood has a ton of this in ARK ETFs already

I’m a Realtor in one of the test markets for Opendoor (Charlotte) and I firmly believe that this company is going to go far.  They are going to completely disrupt and revitalize the real estate industry.

A bit of background about me and my credentials for writing this Due Diligence: I have been a licensee since early 2013. My husband is real estate closing attorney . His office handles 300+ real estate closings per month with 4 offices and 18-20 full-time employees.

My husband was not always a real estate closing attorney. Back in 2010 – 2015, his main bread and butter was handling foreclosure defense. He represented people who were facing foreclosure and helped them avoid it by delaying the process through the court system, helping them apply for and obtain loan modifications or negotiating short sales with their lender. Back then, the market was still recovering from the 2008 crash and there were a lot of people who were upside down in their houses. They simply couldn’t sell them and move on. They owed way more money than houses were selling for and had to convince the bank to allow them to sell the house. The fed bailed out the banks  by allowing short sales and taking a lesser payoff than what was originally lent out, but the process for getting them to agree to do so on an individual level was long, complicated and very difficult. As a Realtor, I assisted with this many times and listed dozens of short sales. During the markets in 2008-2014, this was a huge majority of houses.  Around 2015, the scales tipped back and the market, for the most part, was nearly recovered. Currently, there are no short sales. VERY rare, if so.

Currently, the market in Charlotte is such that inventory cannot keep up with the demand. I talked to a Realtor yesterday who was in the middle of a bidding war with 53 other offers on the table. It is common for most houses to get 20+ offers within hours of listing. It’s an absolute bloodbath out there.

To say that I understand this industry is an understatement. I know it in and out, up and down, left and right. I eat, sleep and dream in real estate and have for a long time.

iBuying is going to shift the entire landscape of how real estate is purchased. I am seeing it happen here now, in real time. So, let me explain…

Realtors have always been the vehicle of connecting buyers and sellers to one another in the process of buying or selling a home. They hold the coveted keys to the castle. This current age of free data and knowledge with the internet  has slowly started to shift that power away from them over the past 20 years. The Association of Realtors has done an excellent job of protecting the industry over the past 2 decades, but technology is getting to the point where they won’t be able to continue to do this in the way they have in the past.

Only Realtors have access to MLS, however  MLS shares that data with online listing websites like Zillow and Realtor.com. Those websites then attract buyers in the market looking at property, they capture the data and then sell the data to the Realtors as leads. It’s ironic, but Realtors have funded the vehicles that will be the end of their industry eventually.

Every property listed on the MLS is usually listed with a Supra iBox that houses the keys for the house for showings. Only Realtors are allowed to hold the keys to these Supra boxes and everytime they are opened, that data is captured and stored. Opendoor has created their own system for lockboxes and showings. They have their own lockboxes. And anyone can download the app to their phone and access the Opendoor properties. Without a Realtor.

In most situations, sellers list their home while they are still living in the property. They have to because until recently, there were only retail buyers who bought them and sellers needed the proceeds from their sale to buy their next house. Sellers listed their house and dealt with the headaches of showings and repairs, negotiations and strict timelines for closings. Sellers went to closing in a moving truck and so did buyers. Everything relied on perfect timing for everything to happen. Lots of drama and massive potential for any one thing to go wrong that sends the entire house of cards tumbling. Delayed lender, appraisal, yada yada yada.

You take a lot of Xanax in this industry….

Enter Opendoor. A company that pulls the power of the transaction away from the coveted few, and puts it right into the consumers’ hands. On both the buyer and seller sides. You see, they have the capital to do this. They have the money to purchase the house without the headache of the buyer’s side and their drama. Seller calls the shots on when closing happens. Seller doesn’t have to deal with showings. Seller doesn’t have to deal with fixing up their house or repair negotiations. Seller doesn’t have to hear about the buyer’s demands. Seller doesn’t have to rely on the buyer’s lender’s drama. Seller doesn’t have to deal with Realtors. Seller doesn’t have to pay commission. (Oftentimes 6%). Seller is in control. Seller has total power of the transaction. Opendoor makes it easy.

Money is merely a measurement of stored time and energy. People underestimate how valuable that is.  Opendoor provides value in saving both for the seller. They eliminate the stress and uncertainly of the unknown.

Opendoor owns the house after closing. They then ready the property to list for sale. They have entire departments devoted to this and marketers on staff who understand exactly what sells a house the quickest. They optimize the house with the knowledge they have.

Then they list it. Except they don’t use one of those mysterious Supra boxes to house the keys to the house that only Realtors have access to. They use their own lockboxes. And they give the power of the showings to the consumer (Buyer) directly. No agent required. The buyer can download their app and access any of their properties, on their schedule. No working around some Realtor’s schedule. The buyer has the power to steer the ship in their own home buying process.

When buyer is ready to make an offer, they can fill it out directly on the Opendoor website. The form is so easy to understand that a child could navigate it. The form fills in the contract and meets the specific legal requirements for each state. In the past, this was where Realtors could valuable. The contracts were so hard to understand, the regular consumer couldn’t manage them without help. Opendoor makes it possible to.  Kinda like Turbo Tax with taxes. Similar in that regard.

Additionally, Opendoor offers the buyers discounts for making offers to them directly.

Opendoor: “ If you buy with Opendoor and finance with Opendoor Home loans (ODHL), you can save up to 1% of your home price via a combination of an ODHL lender credit and either a seller credit at closing (If buying directly) or a commission refund (If working with an Opendoor agent). Amounts vary.”

And yes, Opendoor has their own in-house mortgage company to finance your home as well.

Opendoor: “ Finance with Opendoor Home Loans and get up to $1,000 credit at closing”

Now is the time where I recommend you move over to Opendoor.com and spend 5 minutes browsing their website directly. You will quickly see how easy the interface is to navigate. Yes, even for the retards on this sub.

In a few years, legislation will catch up and it will start allowing eNotary services on closing documents. Covid is the vehicle for pushing this through. Notes, Deed of Trusts, even deeds will legally be signed electronically. Eventually, even the closing will be able to happen all online. Opendoor says they will handle this part through their app too.

The real estate iBuying ecommerce market is going to EXPLODE with Millennials and Zoomers and even some Gen X coming into the market.  As a Millennial myself, I don’t like or want to deal with other people. We grew up behind the screen and we simple don’t know or understand the social skills it takes to communicate face to face. Not only that, we don’t want to. It’s a waste of time. We want to control everything and we want instant gratification.

Currently Opendoor is only active in 20 markets in the US. They plan to scale to 100 markets within a year. In the Charlotte market I work in, I have seen the closing attorney who handles the Opendoor closings (NOT my husband) scale from 1 employee to over 100 employees within 2 years.

**Comment from an Opendoor employee on my original post:** /u/casrox

I have some insight. Former employee. Basically the way opendoor works is by buying houses for less than market price and creating a floating inventory of product(houses) they they actual place in a holding subsidiary. Some of these houses are in hot markets so flip relatively easily, some are in colder markets so the price will be lower and it will take longer to sell. All these factors + condition of house and title issues come into play when they buy a house or sell a house at a certain price. They use a proprietary algorithm so don't know all the specifics as I wasn't a programmer and never messed with that. They make their money from a combination of closing fees, title work fees and profit off their house flipping. A seller/buyer can also bring their own realtor in, but will end up paying both opendoor fee and realtor fee. A lot of times they are able to make pretty decent profit on hot market houses that cover the losses they might suffer on a property they are having a hard time selling or that ends up being a complete wash due to unforseen circumstances(a house that had a murder happen in it and company was never informed for instance). They have well informed title teams with full curative and escrow staff in house due to their acquisition of title company named osnational. They were doing so much prior to acquisition that osnational created subsidiary companies that's exclusively worked on title and closings for opendoor. Due to this they are able to complete title work extremely fast and in some cases 24-48hr closings were not out of the question. They make money in other ways as well, such as doing outside contract title work for other companies and having a mortgage company built into business(opendoor mortgage) to increase the number of fingers they have in the proverbial pie. I never saw the numbers, as I was just a cog in the machine, but I can tell you the output/transactions increased month over month for many months prior to my leaving. The only real risk they run is of housing market does cool and they are stuck with too much inventory(just like of car market cooled and carving had too many cars and no buyers). With interest rates low tho they also get a steady income stream from refinances so not sure how big of a hit they would take if the cool off only lasted a couple months. I still do same job, just for another company, and will say the whole housing industry(buying/selling transactions) is booming. So much so that at the company I work for now, we are understaffed and 60hr+ weeks are not uncommon in order to keep up with massive volume. Opendoor flips primarily low-mid price range houses - which I assume is because it lowers the risk in case cool off period happens. The place I currently work does real high end boutique place(1.5mil-3mil is average price range) and we are slammed so I can assume pretty easily that opendoor is even more slammed. Finally, opendoor is also increasing to more and more markets. Since I left they have expanded to a handful of markets I know about and I'm sure others that they haven't disclosed publicly yet. Anyway, thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

**wHat AbOuT tHe CrAsH cOmInG! wE aRe In A bUbBlE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

As someone who was in the industry during the recovery during the 2008 crash and who helped people avoid foreclosure firsthand, I can explain to you how what we see happening now is NOTHING like what we saw happen then.

The catalyst for the 2008 crash was the teaser ARM (Adjustable rate mortgage) rates that people were given for their mortgages. These rates fluctuated as such a volatile rate, that homeowners found themselves in situations where they could not pay their mortgage within a few years of buying. They did not understand the implications of the ARM loans when they signed on at a teaser, discounted interest rate and did not realize how drastically their mortgage payments would change once those rates adjusted.

The majority of home owners now are at a 2-5% FIXED, 30 year interest rate. Their mortgage payments are about 50% less than what the going rental rate is (at least in my market). People are literally saving thousands of dollars by owning their homes vs. renting. It’s cheaper.

Additionally, the 2008 crash happened because people were able to get mortgages by stating their income. There was no underwriting process that verified anything. They called them NINJA loans- No Income, No Job, No Asaets. This simply can't happen anymore are at any point after the 08 crash. Lenders verify income, debt and credit 3 times during underwriting now, even the day of closing. 

Sidenote: I bought a foreclosure and the prior owner took out 3 cash out refis in 2007 within the same week. He didn't tell the lenders about one another at all. There was NO underwriting process that would have caught this at the time. The guy took all the cash and used it to buy a horse ranch in the same city. He never made a payment to any of the 3 lenders and knew it would go to foreclosure. He didn't care because he won. He beat the system, and you know what? He got away with it. Because he was one of thousands just like him who did the exact same thing and the banks realized it would be cheaper to eat it than fight it through the court systems and try to collect against most people who had no assets. This was 2008. 
This will never be possible again.

**wHaT AbOuT tHe PaNdEmIc and tHe ImPeNdInG FoReClOsUrEs????**

As someone who works in this industry, I am seeing firsthand that every lender is pushing the unpaid mortgage payments on the backend of the notes. This will allow people to avoid paying large lump sums up front.

Additionally, NO ONE IS UNDERWATER in their houses right now. So if, for some reason, a lender were to demand payment, the seller could simply sell and walk away. I haven’t seen a single lender do this. Not one.

**tHiS iS lIKe CARVANA, bUt ReAl EsTaTe iS rIsKiEr.**

No, owning real estate is no riskier than owning cars.

**Cars are a depreciating asset.**

**Real estate is an appreciating asset.**

95% of millionaires are made with owning real estate, myself included.

Many people see real estate as a safer store of value than even gold or other goods. Definitely safer than having it sit in the bank.

Of course there are exceptions to everything. People are able to sell their house after owning it for 30 years and make retirement level money. People retire off their equity. You can't sell your daily driver after using it for 10 years and make the equivalent rate of return. Appreciating vs depreciating. Of course exceptions exist like Condos in RE and rare classic cars. But for the most part, in 99% situations, real estate gains value while personal property loses it. This is economics 101.

**Comment: If I knew I was selling my property for less then fair market value, potentially tens of thousands of dollars, I’d suck it up and hire an agent.**

My Response:

Everyone has their different requirements, desires and wants. Many have different ones. Grandma afraid of Covid and doesn't want showings? No Problemo! No Realtor interview process or dealing with them in the house either? Yes please! Closing happens on my watch at my desired time without crazy buyers in a moving truck barking up my ass? Sign me up! I control the entire transaction myself without relying on a Realtor to do it for me? Sold.

Some people don't care about a few thousand bucks if they know that the time, energy and stress was less. Those things have value too.

People don't realize that Money is merely a storage of value for work/time/energy.

Retail buyers require 10x the headache and energy. You may end up making $2k more on paper, but you've lost it all (and more) by the end of the transaction with the time and energy you had to spend to get there.

**tHiS iS tHe UbEr Of HoUsEs:**

No, it’s not. Uber has zero assets. They don’t own a single car.

They have nothing but their systems and software.

Opendoor actually holds tangible assets unlike companies that literally own nothing like DoorDash, Airbnb, etc.

Sidenote: I would wager that it's VERY likely that they eventually create a property management interface on their app that connects landlords with tenants for a fee and handles the Property Management side of things. This is an obvious next play. I can't confirm this, but it's just what I would be implementing of this were my company.

172,[$SE] Multi-year Emerging Market Growth - This is the Way,57,0.87,Dumb_Nuts,"Alright, listen up my fellow autists. I was drafting this DD up to put in my private archives, but this place isn't autistic enough anymore. Apes are too alpha with their diamond hands and I'm here to bring you some plays to put tendies on the table like good ol days.

I'm here to talk about what's for some reason an under followed stock. **[$SE](https://i.imgur.com/dkHcLZk.png)** 


**BUT WHAT IS $SE?!?!?!?**
Sea Limited is a leading E-commerce, digital payments, and mobile gaming company based in Southeast Asia NOT COMMIE TOWN CHINA (disclaimer I'm long $BABA). They operate through those three segments and benefit from synergies between them.

Let's start with **E-commerce**
It's the middle of a fucking GLOBAL PANDEMIC. I bet your house is filled with cardboard boxes up to the ceilings. At least mine is. I'm buying a lot of shit online, because I'm working from home, trading in my PJs and making FAT STACKS off $SE. While I don't live in Malaysia, I use Amazon. It's the future. Look at the entire brick and mortar retail industry over the last 5-10 years *cough* GME *cough*. Things aren't so hot. You can get things cheaper and exactly what you want.

*I feel this part of the thesis is pretty self explanatory. Do you believe people will continue to buy things online over the next 10 years?* 

* Yes -> buy $SE 
* No -> Go buy GME lol

But how are they doing? FUCKING GREAT. I have access to some proprietary app data I'm too lazy to smuggle off my work PC, but let me say. Things are UP. Downloads, DAU, session length, all the metrics. BOOMIN. Don't believe me? Here's how they've been doing vs. local competitors ($BABA owned Lazada) and a private company rumored to be involved with a one of those special purpose tickers (Tokopedia).

**$SE** mainly competes in its e-commerce segment in the Southeast Asia market. It's key countries are Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil. 
As shown here using google trends, we see that Shopee is now claiming the top spot in relative search interest in many of these markets.

[Current Growth Rates](https://i.imgur.com/3m1OtVS.png)

**Digital Payments.** $SE also has a digital wallet app. This is Southeast Asia. They don't have JP Morgan pulling from everyone's pockets. Everyone's got a phone and uses this in tandem to purchase things online. Did I mention that $SE has both B2C and C2C shopping apps? Want to transact with local business? Process payments and handle your small business checking through $SE. Makes it easy to track and receive payments from customers. Fucking great. Basically lets the company pull a sliver from every transaction going on in their markets.

[Not a compelling YOLO worthy investment on it's own but bolsters the package, just like how stuffing a sock bolsters my cock.](https://i.imgur.com/ogvlJ17.png)



**Mobile Gaming.** What's that? Boom Beach is for dads? I know. Doesn't matter, the rest of the world loves this shit. Their mobile gaming division is called Garena and their biggest game is a battle royale called Free Fire:

 >Garena is a leading esports organizer. It hosts esports events around the world that range from grassroots local tournaments to some of the most viewed professional esports competitions globally. Garena’s largest global esports tournament of 2019, the Free Fire World Series, achieved over 130 million cumulative online views.

[Somehow, this shit fills stadiums.](https://i.imgur.com/QLDDvbz.png)

[And growth don't stop.](https://i.imgur.com/m6BjdsO.png)


Why it's interesting? Recent IPO (relatively). This thing is less than 2 years public and absolutely on a tear. Market cap of $140 billion is especially compelling. Consider that the [e-commerce growth is the fastest in the world in their markets.](https://i.imgur.com/wgSi5qQ.png).

It's a company you value on the top-line. So in a region with 8-10% GDP growth, and 10%+ ecommerce growth it's easy to make a case for 20% top-line growth on right there. Now lets consider an increasing shift in spend from brick and mortar to digital of 10% (you make 1 out of 10 purchases online more than you did last year) and gaining market share. 50% growth isn't hard to achieve on this piece of the business alone. And that's ANNUAL. 

How to play it? LEAPS. Shares are for apes and frees up cash for FDs on pull backs (if it drops more than 10% hammer the ask on all the 20% OTM 60 DTE you can get).

Crossposting. This keeps getting removed. Think why 

Forget the Shorts %, look at those numbers!!

In the post below, it says 1,43MM Etoro customers hold GME Stock, 11% of Customers:

I myself, have 1500, a lot of people have thousands or hundreds of them, more now with Bid price. But let's take lower average of 5shares/pers = 7MM shares on Etoro.(lower average)

Now, we all know that GME was on top list of RH users, but lets take the same % (lower case scenario) of RH users and same amount of shares:

As they Arte the same users number on RH than Etoro (13MM) = extra 7MM shares on RH (lower average)

Now what about Fidelity users:

32MM users so 11%= 3,52MM x 5shares = 17,6 MM shares on Fidelity (lower average)

DEGiro has 600K users:

600K x 11% x 5 = 330K shares Degiro

What about Trade 212 : 13MM users= 7MM shares on T212

​

ANd I am not counting the whales and those by brokers in direct

so we have here on those most popular APP = 7 + 7 + 17,6 + 0,33 + 7 = 38,93MM retailers Shares

​

Yes you read that right !!! 39MM shares detained by retailers without counting the others app or direct brokerage or even the whales, and I took a lower average!!

We know that they the Float share is 48,89MM

OK now you see what I see right? Hold your belt !!!

Last data shows 110% of Institutional Share = 110%/48,89 = 53,779MM institut (lower as I think is higher)

38,93MM + 53,78 MM = 92,7MM Shares detained within Institutions and Retailers while only 48MM are available

==============>>>>>>>>>>>> GME is detained at 193% TOTAL !!!!!

​

Shorts = 73% so 73% of 92,7MM = 67,6 MM Stocks are shorted

67,6MM but 48,89MM is the real Float = 138% real short Number !!!!

​

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-amc-reddit-investing-213609595.html

In this article it said 4,5% of Americans detained at today GME Stock , let's take just 2% with only 5 GME share= 2% x 5 x 329MM = 32,9MM detained by Americans and let's say just 20% extra for rest of the world.

32,9 + 20% = 39,5MM shares by retailers remember up when I said 38,9 MM ??? Quite close right??

​

TNDLR

Retailers hold 39MM Shares = 80%

Institutions hold 113 %

Total= 193 % shares are on the market

SO the real Shorts number is 138%

​

​

Alright , I am going to serve myself a Gin Tonic ! do you even realize what s that means? it is even worst for HF that we even dreamt about!!!!!! they will have to buy any fucking shorts available twice!!!! So Guys, no matter the price you will put, they will buy it, they HAVE TO !!! even at 100K/share!!!! Be £Greedy ::

Options @ 800 are skyrocketing just today more than 3M shares. for the newbies, means a HH take an insurance buy paying a premium that if a Stock goes up 800 (in this case) they will ""only pay"" 800$, the other company pay the extra. Options are with termination dates. You can check here and click on strike to have the higher amount.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME

Meaning they are expecting the stock going way up that 800 so they are taking contract to protect their shorts. (so another premium to add on their shorts premium)

Again they expect to go way up 800..... just think about that.....

the KRE Rally is not over and here is why :

Regional banks, more so than the big money centers in XLF make their $ by taking loans from the FED or depositors who block their money for a year or two and lend it for longer maturities. The best proxy for this metric is the 10/2 spread and it has been going to the moon !

Regional banks are the entities that are most exposed to ""small business"" in the market, in fact if you want to go long the ""real economy"", KRE is about your only bet along with some office/mall REITS/B2B stocks and the true winner, which hasn't been frontran yet of the upcoming reopening is the real economy. 

Have you heard that papi biden is working on **another stimulus package focused on infrastructure ?** Who loans the money to the small bizes who work on that shit ? you guessed it, KRE. I think most of the market has a hard time understanding the size and potential impact of what the dems are cooking for us, here's an excerpt from top strategist at MS leila : 

 ***Unprecedented stimulus***  *– The magnitude of monetary + fiscal stimulus in the US is almost hard for the brain to fully appreciate. We’re not economists, but it appears as if we are on track for \~9 Trillion between fiscal + monetary in the US, over 3x what we did during the financial crisis.  On the fiscal side, if Biden gets his $1.9 Trillion on the back of Trump’s $2.2 Trillion + $900 Billion plans, total Fiscal stimulus over the past year will be \~$5 Trillion or \~24% of U.S. GDP.  The 2008-2009 fiscal stimulus amounted to \~ $1 Trillion -- so we're doing 5x the fiscal.  On the Monetary side, the Fed Balance sheet has risen by $3.6 Trillion since 2019. In 2008-2010 it rose $1.4 Trillion, so we're doing 2.6x the Monetary.   These monetary and fiscal efforts in the US equate to over 40% of GDP.* 

**But isn't the fed keeping interest rates super low ?** 

**Yes they are but this is the limit,** during the last minutes of the FOMC the topic was du jour was removing the special QE programme. Essentially, given that the **worst is behind us in the real economy, the FED WILL NOT BE MARGINALLY MORE DOVISH AND THE NEXT STEP IS A RATE HIKE CYCLE.** it might start in 22 or 23 but no later. Of course it will be priced in both rates and Bank stocks way ahead of time. in fact you can see that bonds have been selling off lately as the market digests the news around the infrastructure package and the FED speeches always make the bonds bounce but then it gets sold again :).

I'm not going even gonna bother with tendies, wifes bf jokes, etc... because as you will see this company is more of a joke than I can make about it.  Also, I was in finance for over a decade, have passed Series 7 & 66 (since lapsed, so fuck you FINRA, I'm not an RR). So I have some clue what I'm talking about.

First, lets talk financials. Courtesy of their [Website](https://investors.hyliion.com/news/news-details/2020/Hyliion-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx)


Revenue: 0

PE: Divide by zero error


Profit Margin: Zilch

Operating Cash Flow: -11.53 million.


Net loss per share 2019: 0.45, Net Loss per share 2020: 0.76. They are burning more money faster.



**Intangable assets (IP aka patents fall under this) 356 thousand.  And somehow that went down from 2019's number of 429 thousand. If they had dope IP it would be worth more. Also the ""new battery"" isn't patented or at least mentioned here**


R & D burned 8.13 million in 2020, and Admin burned 3.7 million.



Debt almost quadrupled from 2019 to 2020




Their R&D spending went up 20% and their Admin and salaries almost doubled.

They redeemed warrants at the start of the year diluting shares and raising 142 million.  This isn't generally seen as a good thing.

**In October they joined with another shady looking SPAC called Tortoise that is (was?) based in the Caymans.  Cause the Caymans are never used for shady financial dealings right?**

Their team is lackluster at best. The CEO is inexperienced and has an undergrad in mechanical engineering. And describes himself on the site as a serial entrepreneur, which is super cringe.

The head engineer was an engineer at Dana, which is why they have some relationship with them. Otherwise nothing of note at all. **So anyone saying 'strong team' etc, hasn't even looked at the website.**

**[Other notes: The new battery system isn't patented or proprietary, and is not listed in their patents.  Which are pretty lackluster.](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/hyliion-inc)**

TL;DR any way you slice it.  Be it from a fundamentals perspective, IP/ Innovation perspective, or market sentiment perspective, this company is dog shit.  It's a SPAC like Nikola, and it's basically a less impressive dog and pony show without bad photoshops or theatrics.  Like they don't even care that much. There are no rockets in this post for a good fucking reason. If there was an bomb emoji it would be there, but for now I give it this. 💩


Position: Puts. I was gonna FOMO in, but I read the press release and it looked like shit, and the more I read the more I was sure it was shit. So much so I got puts.  The more I read the more I think its not just shit, but it's a total scam.

**Main Takeaways: Their patent portfolio is trash, the miracle battery isn't patented, they say their IP is only worth 346k, and they dump more money on admin then they do R&D**

176,AMD and why Sue Bae is giving me a Semi (DD),543,0.93,MoistRegrets,"
*Processing img 962rkkl28yg61...*

[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en) **- Advanced Mooning Devices** 🚀 have gained +12.8% over the past three months. The Semiconductors industry has seen a rise of +28.7%. Business is good.

*The global semiconductor industry has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic that turned 2020 into a great year for microchip makers.* 

If you don't know, microchips are an important part of the auto industry, computing, digital cameras, televisions, washing machines, refrigerators and most importantly 5G systems the government is going to use to record your Google searches for 'how to buy a call option' & 'why is my pp small'? 

Exiting the fourth quarter of 2020 with 21.7% of the overall x86 processor market AMD earned an adjusted 52 cents a share on sales of $3.24 billion in the December quarter. On a year-over-year basis, AMD earnings rose 63% while sales climbed 53%. **For the current quarter, AMD expects to generate revenue of $3.2 billion, up 79% from the year-earlier period.** 

*Processing img 6cxhz0qm6yg61...*

AMD had announced its Ryzen 5000 mobile processors in January this year, and the first laptops based on those chips have started rolling out already. So, Intel will have reasons to worry as more Ryzen 5000-based laptops hit the market.

Yes, AMD saw a huge spike in demand for its latest desktop processors that reportedly outpaced supply, forcing vendors to sell older chips. As CEO Lisa ""Su Bae"" pointed out on the latest [earnings conference call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/) that the supply constraints were in the ""low end of the PC market."" AKA nothing to worry about.

So with that said it's looking likely that AMD's sequential market share loss was just a blip on the radar that has more to do with the launch timing of its latest laptop processors and a supply shortage. Both things they are working (and have been working) on rectifying in the short term. Chip foundry **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing** ([**TSM**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSM)) produces AMD's chips. TSM business is killing it, with stock up \~$20 in approx. 30 day window. 

Is it time to ride the lightning and buy AMD? Strong demand for AMD's products and low supply seems like a perfect mix for shares to resume their gains.

TLDR:

177,Shroom stocks - Are they really the next big thing? Specific recommendations inside,1365,0.83,jkl2117,"The short version: Shroom stocks have huge upside, due to their actual medical effectiveness being very high (loads of studies quoted to back it up) + ongoing approval of many psilocybin-based pharmaceutical drugs in North America + current administration making decriminalization easier. Several psychedelic mushroom stocks are backed by huge investing figures such as Peter Thiel and Kevin O'Leary. AKA 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

3 parts to this DD:

1. The science - why psychedelic mushrooms have huge potential as medicinal products.
2. The rise of mushrooms and psilocybin as pharmaceutical drugs
3. Specific stock recommendations and my positions

**My core thesis:** Psychedelic mushrooms have a lot of scientific evidence backing their beneficial effects for specific conditions. This means that eventually, psilocybin-based drugs are bound to get approved, which will drive the entire psychedelic sector up.

**1 - THE SCIENCE - WHY THEY HAVE HUGE POTENTIAL AS MEDICINAL PRODUCTS**

The evidence behind the effectiveness of psychedelics for various health conditions is piling up.

Harvard University: ""the study authors and the commentators — who include Charles Schuster, former director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse; Nobel Prize winner Solomon Snyder; and nationally known addiction expert Herbert Kleber — recommend revived investigation of the therapeutic and scientific uses of hallucinogens"" - [https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter\_article/Reviving\_the\_study\_of\_hallucinogens](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Reviving_the_study_of_hallucinogens)

Pharmacognosy Review: ""They are also one of the richest source of anticancer and immunomodulating agents. Thus these novel myochemicals from these mushrooms are the wave of future."" - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249912/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249912/)

3 Biotech Journal: ""This will further help the researchers to understand the metabolites and find other metabolites as well from the mushrooms which can be used for the potential development of the drugs to treat various life-threatening diseases."" - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6056353/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6056353/)

DEPRESSION: psilocybin therapy for a startup was given “breakthrough therapy” designation (a review fast track) by the FDA for the treatment of depression (more on this later).

Psilocybin therapy can help smokers abstain from smoking, according to a small pilot study: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641975/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641975/)

Another open label study found that it can reduce heavy drinking: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586396](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586396)

A randomized, double-blind trial from Johns Hopkins in 2016 found that one single dose of psilocybin drastically improved quality of life and decreased depression and anxiety in people suffering from life-threatening cancer diagnoses: [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881116675513](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881116675513)

SUMMARY: There is a huge amount of scientific evidence showing the potential of psilocybin against depression, heavy smoking and drinking, to improve quality of life in cancer patients, and as an anti-cancer agent. This medical evidence is not well known and relatively hard to find and analyze, making it an opportunity for the entire psilocybin sector.

**2 - THE RISE OF PSILOCYBIN DRUGS + SLOW DECRIMINALIZATION**

Psilocybin is slowly decriminalized in the US - Denver, Oakland, and Santa Cruz have legalized its use not long ago. Lawmakers in Ann Arbor, Michigan voted to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms and it's been legalized for therapeutic use in the entire state of Oregon.

I'm NOT claiming that full decriminalization is coming anytime soon. However, the Biden administration SHOULD in theory make at least partial decriminalization a real possibility.

However, my main argument is that it doesn't have to be legal on a major scale at all to explode. The real, major trend is the use and approval of psilocybin in pharmaceuticals.

Whenever a new field get such high amount of scientific studies proving its potential (see above), it's inevitable that startups and firms will try to create patented drugs to benefit from it.

And governments are starting to realize that targeted use of psilocybin for specific health conditions can be very beneficial. Which means that this opportunity is becoming more and more real and interesting for biotech companies.

According to [thekit.ca](https://thekit.ca) \- In Canada, ""The process is well on its way. In August 2020, federal health minister Patty Hajdu granted four end-of-life patients exemptions from current drug laws to use psilocybin to help deal with the anxieties of their terminal illness. (Fifty-three-year-old Laurie Brooks, who has colon cancer, was one of them—read her story next in our Psychedelics Now series). Three more exemptions quickly followed, perhaps a harbinger of restrictions being eased.""

In other words, various psilocybin-based drugs are being approved as we speak, all over North America. As we've seen with marijuana, Canada is usually a trend-setter - and approval of psilocybin pharmaceuticals in Canada is likely to lead to the same outcome in the USA.

As a matter of fact, it's already happening in the US. Like I said earlier, the startup Compass Pathways's new psilocybin treatment received ""breakthrough therapy"" status - essentially giving it a fast track to FDA approval.

This would have NEVER been possible under the previous administration, and is a sign of things to come.

SUMMARY: The current administration makes decriminalization of mushrooms more likely. However, even if full decriminalization is light years away, the FDA approval of psilocybin-based drugs and the same phenomenon in Canada is driving the entire sector way up. Again, this is due to the fact that mushrooms ACTUALLY WORK for a wide range of health conditions.

**3 - SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AND MY POSITIONS**

Now, with all this in mind - if the entire mushroom sector is bound to explode, which stock do I recommend?

1. Compass Pathways ($CMPS) - No need for a huge explanation here. CMPS is the company whose drug received breakthrough therapy designation. This makes FDA approval significantly more likely. Probably the leading mushroom stock. Oh - and the stock is backed by Peter Thiel, too.
2. Mind Medicine ($MMEDF) - Kevin O'Leary invested in the pre-IPO round of $24 million. They're currently running clinical trials to measure the effectiveness of LSD for anxiety and headaches. The company focuses on psychedelic-oriented therapies for anxiety, addiction and ADHD - which are probably the most promising areas of research at the moment. Probably has the biggest upside potential.

There are obviously other stocks, but I've vetted this stock for management integrity (extremely important in a sector like psychedelics) and long-term commercial viability.

My position:

* 100 shares of $CMPS @ $50
* 1200 shares of $MMEDF @ $3.7

178,SKM undervalued. I like the stock,None,0.39,Aikmero,"🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 This isn't financial advise, I'm not an advisor of any kind. I just like this stock and rocket emojis too. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 TLDR: SKM is undervalued. It's wireless business should worth 10B(or more) and it's 20% stake in sk Hynix is valued at 15.4B. Shares should be 40$ to reflect that. Spin-out catalyst could bring that value to shareholders.

SKM has a 20% stake in SK Hynix which equates to nearly 2/3 of its market cap. Which means it's wireless business is SUPER undervalued, or you can get super discounted exposure to SK Hynix. Either is bullish.

Rumors of spinning out the non-wireless businesses from SKM would bring that value to shareholders.

Insiders are buying more, not unloading. Which means insiders at SKM also like rocket emojis 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Risk and catalyst: Spin offs could be unwelcome or difficult to achieve, keep the value discounted. Catalyst: south Korea updated its fair trade act making spins offs easier to achieve.

Had to check a few times because I couldn't believe it. The 20% ownership of SK Hynix is supposedly valued at roughly 15.4ish Billion usd. The entire market cap for SKM listed shows 15.75B usd.

It seems pretty crazy to discount the wireless business they run to only 0.35B. it's probably worth at least 10B? 13B? Let's say 10 for discount sake. For the sake of being lazy, and you probably stopped reading already anyways, let's completely discount all their other retail businesses to 0 and ignore the deal with Microsoft they made for Xbox sales and streaming.

10B + 15.4 = 25.4B I think that will be reasonable for a market cap.

Skm share price would be somewhere near $40 if the wireless business and the 20% ownership of SK Hynix were not discounted. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Downside risk... Lost opportunity somewhere else. It's already discounted and the risk I see is the spin out not happening.

Sideways price action would be the risk (unless you're thetagang)

I like this stock because it's undervalued. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

179,"I Think I Found A Way To Predict Dips with NASDAQ PSX and FINRA Volume, Or Maybe I Really Am Autistic",3528,0.94,President_Wolfe," [Read Only Version of Google Sheet for Comparing Daily Price Change With Multiple Markets' Short Volume](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1emNB6-oMHNk42IaHpJ-67i5PL-Dg2OFblIp50zTH3PI/edit?usp=sharing)   \- Go Nuts Everyone!

&#x200B;

Last night I looked into SNDL and started comparing activities across the various markets that I could find, two for NASDAQ and FINRA's off-exchanges volumes. I sort of expected the relative volumes to be comparable in ratio, but they're not.

No, in fact there is some SERIOUS delay in tracking when markets start to swell up in short volume. If you look at Figure 1 you can see that they don't really seem to follow each other at all most of the time.

Except, when the different market volumes DO start to overlap and follow each other, THAT is when we see the larger dips in stock prices for those days!

&#x200B;

Now if you look at Jan 27th and Feb 10th in Figure 1 you'll see that NASDAQ PSX short volume peaked high, and FINRA and NASDAQ Boston synced up and peaked the very next day.

[Figure 1: Jan28th and Feb 11th were the largest dips, and also when NASDAQ B and FINRA short volumes started to sync up! ](https://preview.redd.it/2dj8tyjpqzg61.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=99aba3f5759d0272c401877acdef93cfea37e73d)

Yes, it is really easy with hindsight 20/20 to say ""OH YEA IT WAS IN THE DATA RIGHT THERE"" but I noticed something from another ""penny stock"" and made the same plot for the different volumes in the market.

[Figure 2: Same plot for different stock, showing similar trends as SNDL.](https://preview.redd.it/f5a16zi7tzg61.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=d631425582fb2593c9041ecc90805bdd2e231861)

Here, we again see the THREE DIFFERENT MARKETS dont usually line up, but when THEY DO START TO SYNC, the price has the largest dips the next day!

So if this is correct, than it's possible to see dip the next day **IF the NASDAQ PSX ShortVolume and FINRA Short Volume begin to move together** towards a peak. We'll see tomorrow, but I think this will show a drop tomorrow of over 20%

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

* Using only 2 data points(stocks) I was able to draw a trendline!
* If different markets start to sync up in volumes, the next day seems to have the largest dips in share price.
* IF my shit analysis is correct, than Boaty Stock is going to crash by over 30% tomorrow, MAYBE

**Edit 1:** Added the links to where you can find the volume txt files, but I've been having issues with the FINRA site, have to clear the browser sometimes or it takes you to a login screen.

**Edit 2:** Was asked to see how my ""theory"" checks out with today's dip in TLRY:

[Edit 2.5: Updated the TLRY data out to Jan 11th, and HOLY SHIT! Only Time the 3 markets sync up and peak is when the price plummets!](https://preview.redd.it/h5yrk8dof0h61.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7c89947359119453a375ee37a56578d524a18ed)

[Edit 2.75: TESLA, this janky ass theory seems to hold for TSLA?!](https://preview.redd.it/a01t7j8q41h61.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9ae45aa3c1bccc557f410a210ff331bd4039297)

**Edit 3:**  BoatyMcBoatFace -4:30am 16% !!! 5am -13%, 9am -20%, 9:25am -13%, **10:30am -18%, Noon - 15%, 1pm - 15%, 2:45pm - 14%**

**Edit 4:** WELP.... -15%, I guessed 20% above, then 3 lines down I said 30%. Now gotta wait till 6pm to get FINRA numbers to see what the 3 volumes looked like.

**Edit 5:** FINAL EDIT, with all the market volumes falling. No idea what it means when they all dip still fairly tight like that, need to go through more data.
