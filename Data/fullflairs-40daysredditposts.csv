lsn2ty,None,N/A,they are trying to margin call us,Discussion,29,0.62,personaanongrata,315,i think that big hedge firms are cognizant of the fact that many of us use margin to invest which is why theyre liquidating their stocks en mass to push the value of our accounts down as low as possible to make us liquidate so we dont get margin called naive on the their part because this only makes us thirst for more blood we should try to target the stocks that they want maybe dividing them by sector and mass purchasing i do believe that american airlines if youre a big holder of that as it was promoted in this thread will be liquidated tomorrow in a brutal way not only did they need to liquidate to cover their shorts for nok amc and gme but i think gme is a diversion but i think they figured out that theres a lot of new investors who dont have the liquidity to cover their margin in effect destroying any and all competition that they had because they had an advance warning by being the cause of the crash they liquidated their stocks before everyone else had the chance to because they perform this after hours this is also why i think they crashed prices so steeply on monday and only continued the downward decline harsher through the end of the week their intent after and i do think that stocks are going to go down more is to leave a bad taste in the mouth of as many new investors as possible and to shake out anyone who is holding gme or nok or amc by virtue of needing the money i think early to mid next week they will be buying back their shares at the rockbottom price that they push the market to so in the end they are planning to be better off if you have liquidity i suggest you look at the stocks that you could never afford before because i think they think they were stupid in fact i know that they think that were stupid which is a fair point however were so stupid that we dont care about money so long as we have enough to eat unfortunate thing for hedgies is their costofliving is a hell of a lot higher than ours i suggest anybody who does not hold amc nok gme pay close attention and lets figure out which stocks will be targeting next there has to be a pattern to keep track of what theyre doing because they seem to be doing it in collaboration which should be securities fraud but you know how this goes who holds the sec responsible for securities fraud no one gtamerican airlines is going to take a steep dip tomorrow i believe along with every other airline as well again the end goal being here to margin call as many people as possible who dont have liquidity gtgtthe sec can suck my dick ive already lost k to nokia in the last run but frankly i dont give a shit so long as they are hurting if hedge funds are reading what im writing now well speak to texting this isnt going to go well for you we win this time no matter how much you try to put us in the red scare us bully us or manipulate the market with the power that you have we might be stupid apes but apes together strong as for me i doubled down on nokia and amc today i sold off some of my kriptoe this is important pls dont flag at a loss so im heated but i wanted to preserve my real liquidity for when shit gets real next week its not over till the fat lady sayings and i dont see lizzo anywhere any and all input is welcome im gonna go do some pull ups dont spend all your buying power just yet if you havent shits about to get realer imho get shorty i bought a bunch of cheap options today for meme stocks and i will ride them into the fucking dirt before i let them win,2021-02-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn2ty/they_are_trying_to_margin_call_us/

lsuxmw,MDP,15.70%,meredith corporation mdp,DD,10,0.64,Aykazu,44,hi wsb this is my first post here not going to lie i only found this site after the hype on gme amc and others personally im not much for hype in general but i do like investing and here is one of my picks from this summer meredith corporation mdp mdp is a media company and holds several well known magazine brands such as people and allrecipes along with over brands im not going to list them all here but you can check them here httpswwwmeredithcomhttpswwwmeredithcomfbclidiwarmhywqjuvlomkdegvkjptzcnvrciqywujhdfgzftfpk so whats the thing with mdp it is a beaten down covid casualty stock that has made some serious progress over the last months and confirmation came just last earnings lets go over some key figures to understand the valuation shares outstanding and these shares are in common and b class stocks as following common shares bclass shares share price as of premarket feb th $ market cap of b book value per share $ or pb of m$ shareholder equity cash per share $ long term debt b$ mdp just released its q results normal company would be q so i will be using the last months as key information and try to break down the results into a normalized form as the results have been elevated quite a bit due to election cycle the data source that i use is the company q available here httpsirmeredithcomfinancialinformationsectionquarterlyresultshttpsirmeredithcomfinancialinformationsectionquarterlyresultsampfbclidiwarzrxxqxlfpdsnfgxraotvkkmrahjjfyozziipdympsfvdafbyc revenue b up operating expenses b down eps months cffo m$ up fcf m$ and up quite a bit since it was bleeding cash in so whats the catch here surely this is very cheap valuation however it gets interesting when we look at the earnings presentation slide to be more precise political advertisement h was m$ this with a adjusted ebitda margin translates into m$ so in order for us to have a better understanding of the month figures here we must subtract this m$ from ebitda of m$ and we get m$ of which da expenses are m$ so we get m$ of which would go to taxes and we get to m$ net earnings so if we do not assume any value for the political advertisement we arrive at pe of around for months earnings and i do wish to emphasize this that we are not talking about month earnings but surely people here understand that every years there is a new election cycle so at least of the election cycle ebitda can be taken into account as we try to predict the future earnings power of mdp if we do that we arrive at net earnings of m$ thats net earnings and eps of $ and the pe drops to again we are talking about months here now based on my calculation i can absolutely say that this is very inexpensive in my opinion company especially when we take into consideration that legacy print media while shrinking has already been surpassed by the digital media side as can be seen in the company earnings presentation slide now going forward into q or q for us normal people i do not know anything except what the company stated in their latest cc and the cfo made a comment that did catch my ear and it was around minute mark of the cc the comment went something like this as of the end of january we had over m$ in the bank and i do wish that you listen the call yourself if and when you are making your investment decision however to my ear that sounded like the cfo just mentioned that they generated over m$ in just month per share that cash generation would translate into $ now for a company thats share price is around $ that is a lot so here is my take on the company what do you guys think,2021-02-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsuxmw/meredith_corporation_mdp/

lsvl8k,None,N/A,really long dd and analysis what happened yesterday explained in detail and exposing the hfs obvious manipulation,DD,14600,0.98,HeyItsPixeL,2679,good morning everyone this is an important update to what happened yesterday ampxb first of all i made a prediction in my post yesterday the prediction wouldve become reality if hedgies didnt overshort with fake shares more about that in a second why do i tell you this i literally received death threats and insults when the market ended just a heads up those are predictions they can be faulty at times especially when hedgies do such unexpected things that no data can predict again more about that in a second so please for the love of god dont harass me insult me or send me death threats when something like that happens i understand your frustration but dont target me ampxb now the juicy stuff what exactly happened yesterday here is a timeline ampxb am the market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a huge spike in volume hedgefunds shorted over shares over the first minutes the amount of shorting was so aggressive that trading got halted twice within the first minutes httpspreviewredditwqgdhctjpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsadecbbffffcbbeebcaf am to pm trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time people kept buying in we hit the daily high of $ at around pm and went sideways for almost hour after that httpspreviewreddityhodbtjpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsbfcdfdefaffebfaacbb pm shit gets interesting really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $ at that point in time between and shares were shorted in the blink of an eye what stood out for me at that point in time is that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack between $ and $ that tells me it was really important to get the price down in that direction more in a few seconds httpspreviewredditoslmnbtjpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsdfbfaafcaaabaff pm to pm people buying in again driving the price up to $ $ and now shit gets juicy httpspreviewreddithavwsctjpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsddbdaeccebaefec pm to pm the rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for minutes until the market closes shares were shorted in this time span httpspreviewreddithpktgctjpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsececfdececedfee now the analysis where did they get so many shares to short gme and why was it not predictable so how could no one forsee this its simple hedgefunds didnt borrow shares to short they created them out of thin air when the market opened yesterday all available $gme shares to borrow were gone already see my second edit from yesterday edit am shorts available for $gme right now they borrowed over shares to short for yesterday and today httpsfinteliossusgmehttpsfinteliossusgme httpsiborrowdeskcomreportgmehttpsiborrowdeskcomreportgme what does this mean well no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now because they are not using real shares to short gme they can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially what happens when we add up to shorts and price dips mentioned above now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious if we add up the three big short attacks right at opening to at noon and about right before close we get shares sold short over the day why is this funny and obvious check the latest finra report it states that yesterday more than were sold short thats almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips httpspreviewredditdvuakydtjpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsfbbddecabddfbdbcb why did they short gme so aggressively with fake shares because bears are fuk see when gme wouldve closed in between $ and $ over call options wouldve become itm if exercised that wouldve driven up the price ahpre or today in the high hundreds maybe even thousands why is that so bad the higher the price gets the more calls get exercised so called options chain the more people jump in because of fomo and we get closer to the magical $ mark where the moass would become inevitable this or next week httpspreviewredditdjwndetjpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampscefbcbedaccfeb what can we learn from this looking forward hedgies dont give a single fuck anymore even when all the data available states that there are no more shorts available to borrow for gme we found all of their etfs where they hid their shorts they keep shorting it to try and stop the moass you know what they say there is nothing more dangerous than an animal thats trapped in a corner ands got nothing to lose anymore thats what were seeing right now no one can give accurate predictions anymore that is based on data this has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions they dont care about the long term results of their illegal actions they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days in short be prepared for everything dont be scared of dips they are more than likely created artificially by highly illegal shorting with faked shares ampxb tldr hedgies are so fucked that they just shorted gme with more than nonexistent shares yesterday keeping the price down in order to stop the gamma squeeze from happening the price wouldve jumped up to a few hundred maybe even thousand dollars today if they didnt do it which wouldve started the real squeeze today they have nothing to lose anymore so be prepared for more highly illegal action and dont get scared by fake dips ampxb editpm european time according to this site httpshortvolumescomtgmehttpshortvolumescomtgme the short sale volume was percent yesterday with a short sale volume of that doesnt mean that hedgies opened million new short positions i am being really conservative and sticking to the if its more than that even better httpspreviewredditlmtsuxkiujpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsfbdefacebbf ampxb edit to all the people wanting understand naked shorting counterfeiting stocks here is a great read httpcounterfeitingstockcomcounterfeitingstockhtmltextinthecontextofthisthecompanycisconsideredcounterfeithttpcounterfeitingstockcomcounterfeitingstockhtmltextinthecontextofthisthecompanycisconsideredcounterfeit quote naked short — this is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares in the context of this document a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company is considered counterfeit this is not a legal conclusion since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon todays rules the alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud returning to our example everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone elses account there is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the dtc without a borrowed share behind the short sale a naked short is really a counterfeit share ampxb editam the fee to borrow gme shares went up by over night and is therefore in the double digits for the first time since weeks httpsiborrowdeskcomreportgmehttpsiborrowdeskcomreportgme ampxb edit how do i know that it was hedgies and not retail selling their shares it is possible that some retail traders sold but if you take a look at the short volume yesterday with shares being sold short and then take a look at the overall sell volume it doesnt add up if there was a huge retail sell off and the additional short volume the price drop wouldve been much much bigger most retail held through therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting because no one was selling ampxb edit i am preparing my next dd right now and holy shit yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and i can give a date for the squeeze to take place almost certain but i dont want to make false promises so please take it with a grain of salt because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date if i am able to finish it today ill link it here as well this actually feels like a conspiracy theory because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true ampxb another edit to blueball you guys even more the crazy lastminute drive up of the price days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight again connecting to that specific date but thats just a theory a gamestop theory just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is ampxb update i have all the data you cant make up how crazy this shit is looking forward to the movie the endgame dd is being released tomorrow pm est pm cet ampxb i keep trying to look for more data and update this post if i made some mistakes or missed something feel free to tell me so i can

ltagot,THE,N/A,why the squeeze has not been squoze,DD,2867,0.94,HomeDepotHank69,726,bear with me apes this is gonne be a long one technical similarities compared to last time if you look at the volume activity – there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump its actually big but its gme were talking about so im speaking in relative terms then volume decreases and the price levels off then on january friday we gme have the biggest volume its ever had in a day however this only raised the price to about $ the next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $ then on jan and thats when we see the price get to its highest points ever but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days after that we all know what happened now compare that price and volume action to now and i think we have something similar i think that this weeks price action and potentially next weeks and volume coincides with the volume and price action of as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled offstabilized another thing to see is that the macd on the year chart just had a bullish convergence for those of you autists who dont know what that is it means that the price action has started a bullish trend the last time it did that on the year chart was in early january when the squeeze was taking form its also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation because of how option expiry works fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they arent obligated to exercise a larger number of options so thats why today was pretty red although not horribly expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind similar market conditions look at market conditions from last time compared to this time spx down massively vix up massively then and now do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when jpow promised no rate hikes for at least a year fuck no its because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover gme shorts conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time the short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting some sites say its which is still huge others say its the issue with this is that these sites are updated only every weeks or month so most of this data is reflective of the postsqueeze when short interest was lower however fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was at one point and today it got up to k but has been declining to about k now this leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who dont learn their lesson and that once it is updated we will see that short interest is back up skyhigh yeah i bet thatll get a few more people interested in this the overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest possibly massive short interest and that many funds still have not covered from last time the borrow fees have gone up x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly httpsiborrowdeskcomreportgmehttpsiborrowdeskcomreportgme this is exactly what happened last time and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need just as a little side bar also look at amc its also repeating the same pattern as gme is this because amc has the same short interest propositions as gme probably not i think that amc just rises with gme but this is just another interesting similarity to last time rh as i said above the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it i would bet that rh and other firms will not restrict buying this time unless it goes above k because a they are much more liquid as of now and b they do not want another one of these press nightmares obviously if this gets too high theyre gonna have to restrict again but i think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time i also just wanna point out that the ceo of interactive brokers even said on cnbc that the price of gme wouldve gone up to over $ if the brokers didnt halt buying so dont underestimate our power i just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they will undoubtedly have to restrict again whether this is their fault or not so any talk of this getting above figures is unlikely to be true however we could easily see it jump to figures if what im saying comes to fruition if you are not suprised when gme goes up above do not be suprised when brokerages ass ram you short interest last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over this time it seems to be about but these statistics dont get updated very often so it could be even higher therefore there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time however because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these which would still lead to a massive jump potentially bigger than last time due to the otm calls what i tend to believe is that many funds either didnt cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $ and are trying to make it go to if this is the case that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting because they dont update often sometimes it takes them weeks to month to update in this situation however the short interest is not as important as the options activity how otm calls can multiply this the reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive otm calls that became itm meaning they had to buy more shares however at the time the most otm strike was something like eventually getting up to over now because of the last squeeze we have otm calls with strikes of this means if the price keeps going up there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time like i said above a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float unless the numbers are inaccurate but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover which could trigger a small short squeeze catalysts one of the most important things that ive learned about gme over the past few months is how wsb reacts to its catalysts this stock has showed us that it reacts very strongly to catalysts specifically ones dealing with ryan cohen and leadership as we know the first one was triggered by cohen becoming a large owner of gme this current one was triggered by the cfo being ousted and partially by cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone as andrew left from shitron said he thinks that gme should dilute some shares and make an acquisition this would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket we also have the possibility of ryan cohen making more moves such as hires appointing himself ceo acquisitions more tweets etc most of all we have earnings on march thankfully after hours which is when this thing likes to jump im gonna take a guess and say that cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively i believe that is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short gamma squeeze this would happen the next day march that also perfectly coincides with the end of the month which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super otm calls which could trigger a gamma squeeze quite honestly because of wsb interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock i could see this type of thing happening every single time theres a catalyst especially at the end of each month the point the point of this is that its not fucking over this squeeze will likely take longer than the first one but could easily be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad this article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as its very short httpsinvestorscultcomgmeshortsqueezehttpsinvestorscultcomgmeshortsqueeze the diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation but just know that these fuckers still have a ton of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze if we know anything its that wall street doesnt learn after it fucks up ie and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and wont sell until gme goes to zero or until wsb puts the funds to zero stay strong apes if the stock goes past my wifes boyfriend has promised to let me sleep in the garage instead of under the deck im not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice im just a dude with a small penis edit wow thank you for all of the replies i completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the etfs especially xrt that makes me even more bullish on this if gme continues to rise these etfs will have to buy more gme to balance becuase of the increased value this is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price i also loved the comments about all of the artificialphantom shorts which make it even more likely that its over shorter however this all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this why are they trying to push it down so much if this is out of rage from last time or if theyre still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time then they still clearly havent learned and that again makes me think that this is all far from over finally our lord and savior dfv has call options expiring april th $ strike so not a shot in hell these are ever otm chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys and probably buys more optionsstock which will just provide more upward momentum i truly believe that the hf are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage for those of you who say “hf wont fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” has entered the chat like i said i think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one but could easily be bigger i cant emphasize enough how important i think the earnings call catalyst will be be strong apes dont get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong theres some shady stuff going down god this is

httpswwwfinraorgfinradatashortsalevolumedailyhttpswwwfinraorgfinradatashortsalevolumedaily note if you want to find this raw data use the link above and you will need to go into each days file updated at pm daily and search for gme then copy the raw numbers the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to this is not a userfriendly document there was an additional million in short volume today on top of the m yesterday and m wednesday while this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio the short volume as of total daily volume as published by finra is at which is the same levels that we saw on jan when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price caveats this data does not include nyse which is why total volume for today is m but actual total vol is million thanks to utrifireengineer for bringing this up he has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that once nyse data was included short volume went up from to i think this shows that while the finra data is just a sample its large enough to be considered representative of the full market daily data does not equate to of total shares that are shorted as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered shorting but is not what we would usually define the best data is the monthly finra data but that only comes out once a month and that doesnt sound very fun here are my data tables again all taken from the finra daily data assumptions used gme float stock this is more pessimistic than some reports of only m gme total shares

associated with shorting gme the data available through iborrowdeskcom httpsiborrowdeskcomreportgmehttpsiborrowdeskcomreportgme for those wondering about the site check out the about page the site uses text files from interactive brokers ftp site httpsiborrowdeskcomabouthttpsiborrowdeskcomabout note this data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at interactive broker but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost httpspreviewredditroplclykpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsfacfeefbbfbfce here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from million at borrow rate to only at borrow rate the last time there were less than shares available to borrow and interest rates above as seen through this site was on jan when we saw some huge intraday price swings part etfs this data of course doesnt take into account the shorted shares in etfs that have high stakes in gme for example ex ar tee is currently shorted m shares on m and gme as of its portfolio httpswwwetfchannelcomsymbolxrthttpswwwetfchannelcomsymbolxrt doing some quick math of $m of gme at $ k shares of gme x short

published an article singling out this etf because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved ie shorted gt“…we have detected an approximate $ million dollar outflow thats a decrease week over week from to ” if these numbers are true then it is shorted closer to m shorts m shares note you cannot squeeze an etf as it is just a collection of shares the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows shrinks this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the etf tldr they are doing everything they can to stop this

ltmxom,None,N/A,is shorting bonds the new infinite money glitch,DD,105,0.81,DivySuresh,92,good morning my fellow degenerates hope you all are in good health and spirit tldr shorting bonds could be one hell of a play shorting emerging market foreign junk grade corporate bonds might be the fucking moonshot if im right today i want to talk about the most boomer investment there is fixed income securities or bonds so just some background information bonds are a debt based security meaning that you are loaning a company municipality or government money in exchange for regular interest payments but the underlying issue i see is when any significant inflation happensits when not if more on this later and the fed hikes rates most of the bonds issued now and in the past few years suffer from something called interest rate risk interest rates share an inverse relationship with bonds so when rates rise gt existing bonds fall this makes sense because why would you ever keep money in a bond paying x when the current going rate for bonds is much higher this kind of market pressure can quickly tank bond prices which is why i think shorting certain corporate bonds or etfs who hold corporate bonds is a good idea why inflation is going to spike this topic has been discussed to death here on wsb by the few 🌈🐻who havent yet been hunted to extinction by jpows money printer now im not going to waste your time and explain in detail every reason i believe relatively high inflation is just on the horizon that being said im going to recap the highlights of the core arguments mmoney supply has increased drastically through quantitative easing but unlike where they lowered rates through decreasing yields on treasuries theyve also started buying up other debt securities directly decreasing yields across the board they did this to help ease the burden on businesses and allow them to borrow money for much cheaper they also did this because the credit market froze and when the debt market freezes you know shit is about to go down but this time also unlike the fed went full brrrrrr and well ampxb does injecting this much money into the system seem sustainable to youhttpspreviewredditfqcibcezjpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsdcafbabfdbcdace ampxb the graph really speaks for itself so much money has been injected into the economy through the debt markets that bonds yields are practically nothing the reason we havent seen that money actually inflate the economy is because the velocity of money has tanked for the retards in the back who fell asleep in econ the velocity of money is the rate at which money changes hands to purchase a good or service within a given timeframe because economies all across the world are dampened at the moment with all the restrictions and shutdowns the average consumer is spending much less now than they would otherwise be expected to the velocity of money is going to skyrocket as the economies of the world open back uphttpspreviewredditlvzafhzfzjpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsbeedcbbfcabf as all this money which was previously locked up in households and businesses reenters the economy well likely see a sharp uptick in inflation now the people who run the federal reserve arent dumb they realize that this sharp rise in inflation is bad the fed doesnt want to see runaway inflation and so theyll do whatever they can to counteract the effects of printing this much money the most effective way of the fed counteracting all this printing is by creating a big negative liquidity shock this is known as quantitative tightening read raising interest rates which is going to absolutely decimate bond prices which is why credit where credit is due as a liquidity shock occurs the market usually does sell off so the 🌈🐻 converting to a cash position isnt actually the worst thing you could do but then again being cash gang means inflation gang is slowly eating your effective capital it also means you hold a position even more fucking boomer read boring as shit than investing in bonds congrats now that we established what interest rate risk is how it effects bonds and why were likely to see a substantial amount of it in the coming months years its time to narrow down the pool of bonds we could short governments across the world are printing money like theres no tomorrow and this is because the growth corrected interest rate is negative its not only negative in europe and japan but also much of the developing world which means governments there are much likelier to take on higher amounts of debt now mathematically speaking this is fine as long as compound growth outpaces or stays in line with compound interest this debt is manageable it becomes less and less of a burden with each subsequent year inflation the problem occurs when that growth is strained or when interest rates get hiked most rates are effectively negative accounting for growthhttpspreviewredditcpgckzjpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsbebefebadebbbe i think the prime target is emerging market foreign junk grade corporate bonds that are denominated in usd the reason i say this is in the event of qt by the fed there will be a liquidity shock creating a spike in demand for us dollars which is what the world relies on for most global trade this makes the dollar gain value in relation to other currencies quite quickly and probably unexpectedly unless the market prices this in which will see these bonds decrease in value anyway making your short position profitable bonds from companies that primarily do business in local currencies but hold debt denominated in dollars face exchange rate risk if the price of their local currency falls in relation to the us dollar they end up paying much more than expected in their local currency to keep up with their payments if this is not an investment grade bond it means rating agencies think the company has heightened default risk so this very well could be the straw that breaks the camels back and bankrupts some of these companies even if they stay solvent i think the increased risk would cause a decent sell off now because im not blind and i see the sentiment on this sub and their views on short selling unlike melvin and co i am not over shorting or illegally naked short selling a company and directly engineering the failure of these assets companies i am merely using the data available to me and making a bet on where bond prices will be in a few years time if i enter this trade and or make money off it i will donate a portion of the winnings to a charity that operates within the emerging markets i shorted why the fuck are you telling me this now if this isnt going to happen for a while because the sooner individual investors recognize the opportunity the sooner individual investors can pick the best targets furthermore all of this is for naught if rate hikes are priced in before individual investors enter their short position this is already priced in no the fuck it isnt why do you think theres usually a market selloff and downward pressure on debt markets directly following rate hike announcements unless the news is ridiculously old most of the time it isnt priced in i watched you retards claim disney was priced in for weeks and i still saw disneys stock spike on rollout day disclaimers disclaimer i am not as familiar with debt markets as i am with derivative and equity markets so i may have missed something obvious theres a reason i post this shit before i actually call my broker to initiate the short position i am also not a certified financial advisor investment in any security poses risk not all positions are suitable for all investors keep your goals needs and risk appetite in mind before you invest disclaimer shorting debt instruments like bonds carries hidden interest payment risk youre liable for paying the interest payments until you close out of your short position bonds are also much less liquid than stocks so finding bonds to close out your position could be difficult shorting is also an unlimited risk strategy so idk maybe buy calls on the bonds to hedge let me know what you think am i the next dr michael mcflurry burry or the most retarded thing this sub has seen since robinhood box spreads i dont want to go full retard so i figured id

ltudu7,GME,307.08%,gme dd why the volkswagen comparison is much more inaccurate than you thought but in a different way,DD,1633,0.95,UnUnimportant-,441,hey folks im not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers but over the last few days ive just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant vw comparisons weve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying gme performance but actually underplaying it apologies for the lack of rockets but im not writing this on a phone have fun with all the text so the vw short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for gme with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance there seemed to be a very common response to these vw shills which was often along the lines of “well yeah there are more gme shares shorted than there were vw shares but since the effective gme float is whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares again reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago significantly larger than the or so of vw shares there was in effect the short interest on vw led to a shortfloat ratio meanwhile gme would by nature of its much larger float have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far far greater short interest math i accepted this for the last few weeks but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example i came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned tldr you can cover infinite short positions with one real share as long as you make an infinite number of transactions but you can only cover one naked short position with the one created counterfeit share lets explain that for those that dont immediately get the logic imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted vw presumably the vast majority if not all of the shorts executed went the following way you start with shares you borrow one from a broker you now have shares you sell that share completing your short you now have shares now imagine the short squeeze happens and lets say there are people like you who all shorted one real share each the thing is you can buy a share off the market returning your total to shares before you return it to shares by giving it to your broker your broker can now sell that share to other shorts and they to other shorts etc the point being when working with real shares an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts while still driving the price up now heres the kicker which has been tormenting me over the last few days as i try not to get my hopes too high imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund named delvin capital you go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting you start with shares you do not borrow one from your broker you sell a “share” promising to fulfill the step you just skipped “sometime soonish maybe” you now have shares now the squeeze happens as above but this time the other friends of yours are similarly positioned and also made naked short positions notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy you buy that one share off the market to cover your short notice your total is not positive but only since you were actually negative to begin with thus you cant give these shares to your broker or another fund since doing so would only return you to a negative value the point being naked shorts unlike normal pg shorts have what is effectively a cover ratio the whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is as far as i can reason impossible maybe thats why they havent squeezed yet heres where vw vs gme comes back in though gmes nominal institutional ownership is over furthermore with all the recently unearthed etf shorts added in gme shorts are pretty obviously over when you consider that with retail not even factored into the equation this cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts their desperation seems to have been if anything undervalued this whole time the only way they can cover naked shorts is buy repurchasing an almost identical number of shares and it is this fact that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist without trading the same ones back and forth which makes this fucking crazy assuming retail and bullish institutions hold it is not just exceedingly costly but impossible for them to cover if youve gotten this far congratulations now think about that again effective tldr people asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule probably pretty fucking high vw may be a good example but heres my question what will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it vw is definitely not a good example if anything its an understatement i think this is what actually makes gme something weve never ever seen before in all of financial history please reflect on this and correct me if im wrong i hope im not joy to all unimportant this is not financial advise and i am not a financial

bidu xpev on a milk carton but our family still has hope jd i use barchart and tos for general flow but use unusual whales scanner for most of my uoa picks shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that im playing update docu ceo speaking at morgan stanly tmt conference monday am this c came through last weekhttpsiimgurcomddcqvpjpg suicidal strike but i like the sentiment when the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling im in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough why because the moment i buy a put we are going to new alltime highs i just know it so ive had to work a little harder to pull out the calls and im happy for those of you that got the spot snap and ba tendies from last weeks dd xpev was kind of weird tooi guess i need to take buy american honestly ill take for picks on a bloody week any day though please remember when things are this volatile choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction after the first hour of the day minimum unless were playing a specific event the difference between a failing play and a intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open or buying two hours later and dont get greedythis is guerilla warfare right now take your pop profits unless you have pdt restriction in which case go tighter to the strike and much longer than the whale if you cant afford it dont play it there are opportunities every day anyway i want to go in a little different direction this week as something interesting stood out to me ready lets roll the spot whale anatomy of a carcass on monday as i dined on spot tendies while the world burned around me i was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses on sunday afternoon after the dd was written some further research revealed that at am on monday spot was hosting an “investor day” investor day was indeed the whales bet and boy did it pay off with that intraday pop i hadnt heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit so my spidey sense was tingling then the next interesting hits came last weeks whales to watch had snap picked as another play to follow based on otm call activity and repeat betting on tuesday and wednesday amidst the storm snap indeed went nuts with intraday pops twtr which id made a note of the week prior had the same activity what was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together investoranalyst days it was time to get to work the investigation i wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just havent paid much attention to the results were interesting in two ways snaphttpsinvestorsnapcomoverviewdefaultaspx spothttpsinvestorsspotifycomhomedefaultaspx and twtrhttpsinvestortwitterinccomeventsandpresentationsdefaultaspx investor relations pages show these events in but not in or earnings sure annual meetings indubitably conferences yes investoranalyst days nay small sample size obviously but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two yearsid call it significant snap spot and twtr investoranalyst days all came shortly after their earnings reports this is important later snap er was investor day was spot er was investor day was twtr er analyst day was all three of these tickers had otm whale bets with expirations the week of the investoranalyst events all three of these came within a month of their er all three of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just thatpump note i did some quick searching of recent pumped tech and pypl employed the same strategy no investor day in yet after their er on they hosted an investor day on these companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said we are having a virtual event where we are going to paump our brains out defining rambo as i continued to poke around i saw more and more similar examples simple searches of otm whale activity for specific dates on the tickers which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations conferences and meetings on their corporate sites gives valuable input for what may be brewing i also saw that morgan stanley is hosting its annual technology media and telecom conferencehttpsesnnetmorganstanleytechnologymediaandtelecomconferencemarch among others our favorite fsly is set to present 😬 😉 given that these plays coincide with investor relations meetingsconferences and are blatant pumps ill refer to it as rambo relations and meeting buy opportunities theorizing recent increases of rambo what stuck out to me was that these recent tech rambos were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports spot if youre going to change the world with podcasts in sierra leone or whatever why not announce it during the er you had a couple weeks priorbefore the same can be asked of others like pypl snap twtr etc my theory is that the current er environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a estimate beat means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards in a way they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time after seeing the success of this manuever this past week i wouldnt be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day analyst day or key meetingconference so what am i saying im saying that given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions we are likely to see an uptrend in otm whale calls coinciding with rambo separate from earnings reports one of the first things i will be doing when i see a call flow or whale activity that i like is check it against the companies investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of hunting for rambo picks ill test this on in light of jnj vaccine this weekend wait on price action to settle for tech calls epdhttpsiimgurcomurgpbjpg 🚀 🚀 dipping a toe in with this nice boring boomer midstream oil giant they pay a fat ass dividend yield of but lets be reali couldnt care less about that because this dd is about the hunt for glory not my retirement income the real opportunity is in the fact that on friday two separate bets were placed for epd in the near future including a c for they coincided with upcoming rambo as epd is holding an investor day on march th with an esg discussion preceding it on march rdhttpswwwenterpriseproductscominvestorspresentations they are also holding a q and a session to field questions from both events you know who else scheduled a q and a to discuss their investor day spot did last week i see this as a confidence move and i see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould potentially be newsworthy ill roll the dice here but keep it safe and drop if the news is a dud as a side note though oil is just a good long term play for my xom and rds leaps have been puhrinting as always pick a good entry point biduhttpsiimgurcomgxabodjpg 🚀 🚀 edit the bidu stock split isnt the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a prehk listing

attack in my professional opinion the toolset jfrog offers is the best available to combat this kind of threat and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security that is why i am very much a bullfrog 🐂🐸 if there is interest i will do a deeper dive into this aspect at another time but for this initial one this is the huge surge in demand for their capabilities and the need for going beyond the basics is my thesis why this company is positioned to do very very well going forward company background they were founded in and there main product has been artifactory ever since it has only direct competitor with similar scope sonatype nexus but artifactory is better and cheaper sonatype started as a plugin for artifactory that does something similar to xray before xray existed then they copycatted the universal repo so jfrog hit back with xray i have used both of these products over the years since and i have worked in environments without artifactory improves developer productivity a lot and it secures company intellectual property their product is used by most of the fortune companies this includes google aws microsoft ibm and facebook these companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels the software that runs their entire companies safe that should tell you something about how good it is they have over renewal rate of their customers they acquired shippable in which basically lets them offer the whole sausage factory though the area where this competes is very competitive with some very good products that are open source their focus lately has been on offering a saas model to complement their on prem offering and make adoption easier this should also grow their revenue a lot because it will make it easier to buy the total package instead of just the most basic they went public in late but it was very low key since they came out the same day as snowflake financials i am including a couple of comps here based on the segment they operate in atlassian team makes jira confluence and trello which are used by most software teams for managing requirements and agile software team collaboration i picked them as a comp because i view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing artifactory crowdstrike crwd is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running as a high growth software company unsurprisingly their gaap earnings are negative surprisingly to me though they are very minor and they have even had quarter of profitability frog $ crwd $ team $ their market cap frog $ b crwd $ b team $ b their forward pe ratio frog crwd team they dont have any long term debt their current ratio short term assetsshort term debt is their margin is over revenue is growing yoy ownership owned by insiders and institutions most of that ownership is insiders because there are only etfs including an ark index fund that own it their final lockup was just released on after their earnings and insiders have through to sell before they go back into lockup this is similar to what happened with palantir recently but it seems like most of them have sold what they are going to sell tldr they have a great product and have cornered a growing market they invented which has high barriers to entry they are well managed and have good financials as well positions shares and options i am planning to get more options on monday if you havent guessed yet i like the stock you can

inception on jan th ditched dreams of nasdaq listinghttpswwwnewcannabisventurescomhightimesditchesdreamsofnasdaqlisting gthightimes holding corp parent of high times revealed that it has abandoned its efforts to list on the nasdaq a goal it had been pursuing for since mid the company launched an offering two years ago at $ per share through the reg a process and it reported that it would extend its reg a capital raise until million shares had been sold or until march st it disclosed in an sec filing that it recently sold shares at $ in a private placement to ontariobased rayray investments raymond leach an original investor in medreleaf a discount to where it has been selling shares high times securities lawyers stephen weiss and megan penick of la based michelman robinson llp confirmed

reports talks reg ahttpsvimeocom harvest acquisitions it was in march that harvest health announced an $ million buyout of that entire company then literally two months later we see a letter of intent filed by hightimes now and harvest saying gtokay well were actually going to buy the california assets of have a heart why that was contradictory is that harvest had just been on an investor call telling people when an analyst asked gtwhy are you doing this deal they said well we want a stronger footprint in california it didnt make sense that two months later theyre getting rid of everything they just bought in california additionally in the last month there have beenmultiple news reportshttpsmjbizdailycomhightimescannabisretailbidcomplicatedbywebofownerssocialequitypartnersamp questioning if harvest even has ownership or control of the cannabis licenses to sell to high times very little cash actually changes hands in the deals crafted by high times instead it has announced millions of stock which isnt publicly traded yet will pay for the asset purchases with the harvest acquisition high times attorney stephen weiss confirmed for clr that $ million was paid to harvest but at signing only $k was given the asset purchase agreement filed with the sec said high times would pay harvest $ million on signing this is just a complete lack of transparency and its completely unfair for the main street investor trying to get into cannabis done before starting the securities and exchange commission has told a us operated cannabis media and dispensary company high times holdings that they must halt accepting investments in their miniipo because they have failed to meet an extended deadline to file their audited annual report gtthe last date the company was allowed to take investments was the middle of june high times used a reporting extension the sec created because of the covid pandemic to get a day extension to file the annual report and said in recent sec disclosure filings called form u that they promised investors to get them current revenue cash flows debt levels and asset values by june via the annual report but clr has learnt that this never happened adam levins company has spent over two years trying to get main street to invest up to $us million without a successful close date that could lead to publicly traded stock on the otc markets under the ticker $hitm on june th the company made an sec filinghttpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardataindexhtm announcing once again their miniipo would be extended for yet another three months but left out the important fact that they couldnt actually accept sales when asked if it is normal practice for a reg a issuer to continue to solicit investments when it cant accept sales securities attorney sara hanks said ”the sec may have softened up in the covid crisis but previously both sales and offers were supposed to stop during such time as the issuer was delinquent in its filings because there is no exemption under reg a for “offers” advertising etc while a company is delinquent” high times still has their investment offering page

have seen a rapid pace of public announcements about asset purchases via signed letter of intents hyping the potential growth of high times followed up with quiet sec filings announcing the deals had either fallen apart or been watered down i have personally fallen for this sham f as i invested in units in they stopped responding to my inquires in fact there was a random charge on my credit card from an airport in la the same day they charged my card for the ipo they stated that it would be refunded never was i can still log on and see the shares i have “invested” but they obviosuly dont represent anything lesson learned recent financials the company filed apostqualification amendment to its form ahttpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardatafaposahightimesholdhtm with the sec that suggests the financial condition has become even more precarious in the first quarter of sales plunged to just $ million most of the decline can be attributed to the events business which fell almost but publishing revenue declined over as well the company indicated that its cannabis cup events will take place later in the year compared to the prior year with one in las vegas and in los angeles taking place in the first quarter of and none in the first quarter of the $k in sales were generated by smaller events and the company expects the number of cannabis cups and small events to increase for the full year it blamed the publishing decline on lower sales at the newsstands and through subscription and lower print advertising revenue with digital partially offsetting these factors the company provided information about its cost of revenue which was $k as well as its operating expenses which declined substantially to $ million producing an operating loss of $ million compared to an operating loss in the first quarter of of $ million much of the yearago operating expenses were due to a onetime noncash charge of $ million for equity compensation charges for consulting the last time the company filed official annual earnings was june high times had told investors it would get updated financial information on june but that did not happen the company has extended the offering of shares for two years initially telling investors that it would list its shares on the nasdaq then it lowered those expectations to the overthecounter marketplace still it hasnt happened i am not a

comlifestylewarrenbuffettdumpsallhiscostcostockreasonswhythatisabigsurprisehtml well considering that he sold it off prior to november th could it have been him doing that huge red candle on nov th shouldnt the stock have begun to drop from there it should have but it didnt so i looked some more and found that costco announced a special $ dividend which is pretty highi mean rkt announced a $ div and thought that was amazing my first thought was that damn costco made a lot of money to do a $ dividend and second that this drop isnt justified if costco is making a ton of money httpsfinance dot

httpspreviewredditnndtrherkpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsbdcfbcdaceff as you can see right after the dividend has passed the stock begins a slow bleed until you see the final crazy selloff at the end and with that $ dividend in the back of my head im already thinking that this sell off is all sentiment without any real reason so i do some due diligence and look at the financials earning calls etc i then mark them on the chart to see what kind of effect those things had on the price they seemed to help or negate the stock even during this time of speculative hype ampxb httpspreviewredditkhpvqcjerkpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsafaccdabaceabaec each blue vertical line marks an earnings call where if you zoom in close enough you can easily see the market respond negatively or positively to the results in a pretty normal fashion within a week or so afterwards each call is followed by a swing of about points up or points down typical moves for a stock trading in the hundreds this confirms to me that without a trigger to drop the price of costco there really isnt any reason why the stock is dropping and that any positive earnings should push it back up and any negative earnings should drop it further or remain the same ampxb httpspreviewredditztlqhukerkpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsacabdfaeadfcccfba as you can see the stock is just completely

lwvezn,ASX,2.98%,i think igo limited asxigo has an undervalued position as a lithium mining play for the inevitable ev revolution high level dd,DD,24,0.72,VeniceKing719,42,felt compelled to start a discussion given i cant find any mainstream analysis regarding what i think has to be one of the stronger lithium plays to make everyone knows the big dogs in the lithium space albemarle alb sqm ganfeng etc and even the smaller speculative players however it seems there is one mining company thats flown under the radar and quietly secured itself a piece of what i think will be one of the most important lithium mines in the world let me tell you about igo limited asxigo and the deal they made to cut into greenbushes greenbushes mine located in western australia is operated by talison lithium a joint venture by tianqi controlling share and albemarle tianqi bought some shares in sqm at the height of the last lithium boom but since then prices have fallen flat and tianqi is fucked with debt they needed a lifeline and in december igo was happy to help and secure a piece of the lithium powered future for about billion they secured part of a very valuable asset let me explain below greenbushes mine utilizes the hard rock method of lithium mining and depending on who you ask is the largest such mine on earth raw spodumene is mined that is then processed to lithium carbonate from there it can be refined into lithium hydroxide the most sought after lithiumbased component for ev batteries that is one method of mining lithium the other way is via brining brining is the way they do it in the lithium triangle of south america which is where most of the mainstream attention on lithium mining is placed however i think that when the supply crunch comes brine mining will be be disfavored by ev and battery manufacturers let me explain below hard rock vs brine hard rock has a lower production cost but a lower output yield it is relatively immune from the effects of inclement weather it does not require massive amounts of water and its environmental costs are relatively pedestrian compared to brining brine mining has a higher production cost but a higher output however it is affected by inclement weather likely to become a problem over the next years imo requires massive amounts of water and has some pretty steep environmental and political risks source httpswwwwiredcoukarticlelithiumbatteriesenvironmentimpact given the large amount of water required in the brining process and the political effect it has on local and indigenous peoples i dont think it is viable in the green future ev and battery makers will feel pressure and may even face regulation that their supply chain is carbon neutral green etc when you consider why the ev revolution is happening it doesnt make sense to buy lithium from a source that requires massive amounts of fresh water a resource that is sure to come under more scrutiny in the next years there is a possibility that innovation could fix the environmental concerns with brining but personally i dont know if that is likely to happen before the supply crunch that is expected by now the key $$$ fact is that when a hard rock mines lithium carbonate is processed into lithium hydroxide it is the highest margin product in the lithium trade cant post the graphic but its in this source along with other great info sourcehttpspagesmarketintelligencespglobalcomlithiumbrinevshardrockdemoconfirmationmjadhtml brining can also yield lithium hydroxide but it requires an extra step and extra cost in the process to do so so now we know that a hard rock mine that produces lithium hydroxide provides the highest margin product available greenbushes mine has the benefit of a lithium hydroxide refinery vertically integrated into its production cycle the plant is called kwianna and was solely owned by tianqi until igo came in for billion igo secured stake in greenbushes mine and of kwianna lithium hydroxide plant whats interesting is that ablemarle tried to buyout tianqi of its greenbushes share in the summer of from my pov this is indicative of how valuable greenbushes is thankfully the igotianqi deal was structured in a way that per abl spokesman didnt trigger the right of first refusal clause speculation is that china was loathe to let an asset fall in complete control of a rival giant which makes me think that if tianqis financial troubles continue igo could be in a prime spot to secure an additional stake in greenbushes and kwianna tldr brine mining has credible downsides that i believe are being overlooked which could make hard rock miners more desirable by evbattery manufacturers as more attention is placed on their supply chains and the supply crunch comes to fruition greenbushes is the largest hard rock mine in the world and i believe one of the few that has a lithium hydroxide plant vertically integrated igo is in a unique position having bought into a mine with operations already up and running of the mine and of the refinery it is almost completely absent from all lithium mining discussion by mainstream outlets and i dont understand why that is relatively new to investing and posting so if there is a reason that igo isnt a worthwhile play please enlighten me position holding long shares $ usd and buying more when i can cant post the otc ticker as i dont want

with vistas media capital ampxb vistas media capital the blank check company ipod last august with an initial pricing of $ and a volume of m i cant find much on previous activities of this company prior to or even after the ipo beyond this merger it does not seem like they have done much heres the company mission statement vistas media acquisition company inc nasdaqvmacu “vmac” or the “company” is a blank check company also commonly referred to as a special purpose acquisition company or spac formed for the purpose of effecting a merger share exchange asset acquisition share purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities in the global media and entertainment sector the company intends to identify a target business in the global media amp entertainment sector past their ipo they kept trading sideways at around $ with occasional dips and peaks hitting a w low at and a high of vmacuhttpswwwmarketwatchcominvestingstockvmacumodmwquotetab vistas media acquisitionhttpsvmacmedia ampxb shuaacapital this is where things get a bit fucky from my end due to this being the uae market and in dirham the local currency there i tried my best to synthesize what little information i could find and come to some sort of conclusion on them first off shuaa is a united arab emiratesbased company engaged in the provision of financial and investment services the company is organized into five segments the asset management segment manages conventional equity debt and money market as well as shariah compliant portfolios and investment funds using both active and passive management styles the investment banking segment provides corporate finance advisory private placements public offerings of equity and debt securities among others the brokerage segment operates under the brand of shuaa securities and acts as principal and agent providing custody and clearing services to clients providing access to regional exchanges some interesting figures and news pertaining to shuaacapital they were up in profits in httpswwwkhaleejtimescombusinesscorporateshuaasnetprofitsurgestodhm and they won two awards asset management company of the year and best investment bank in menahttpswwwalbawabacombusinessprshuaacapitalsecurestwoawardsbackstrong not sure whos giving out these awards but hey good for shuaa publicity is publicity as i mentioned they are far better established than vmacu already trading on the dubai financial market for the past years its essentially a penny stock with a high of aed usd and currently trading sideways at around aed usd shuaa capital investor relationshttpswwwshuaacominvestorrelations $shuaahttpswwwbloombergcomquoteshuaauh btw i joined shuaacapital even though they are two seperate words just so the automod doesnt freak over the penny stock mention ampxb my moves so even though the acquisition isnt by catalysts big enough to singlehandedly cause a stir i am still very bullish simply due to the hold anghami has in that sector some westernized middle easterners may use spotify or other similar services but what you need to know is the biggest market to hit on is not the same demographic as a middle eastern reddit user to expand on this across various social circles in the middle east and surrounding countries the technology and platforms used also vary significantly more specifically for example a kid from egypt that went to a private school and talks english with his friends and mainly listens to rap and not egyptian music is not the demographic but he is also not the majority in these locales the majority is public schooled people who are not as westernized and mainly listen to egyptian for the sake of our example and similar music from the surrounding culture this exact market is what anghami has completely nailed none of the people who purely want to listen to their regional artists and music will go to any other platform than anghami as a person with a middle eastern background trust me this app is the one taking over in this field kind of similar to how jumia is also taking over the online ordering market by sculpting their services for the areas in which they are offered i would not be surprised if some lowgrade mobile companies team up and have it as a default app for phones sold in this region generally just lots of potential and the team behind the main app has been very good in stimulating growth anghami to merge with vistashttpstalksanghamicomanghamimergeswithvistasmediaacquisitioncompanyinctobecomefirstarabtechnologycompanytolistonnasdaqnewyork about

lx0ls8,RKT,14.27%,rkt is being pushed as a distraction from gme a quantitative analysis,Discussion,1895,0.82,pdwp90,725,edit based on the fact that a number of comments seem to have been made without reading beyond the first words of the title and the fact that this is sitting at upvoted id encourage you to at least read to the tldr i usually stick to providing raw data but this post has a little bit of added analysis i dont own $gme or $rkt i dont actively invest to avoid accusations of bias in my data and dont like either stock over the other i do like wsb though and dont like baseless conspiracy theories and i have seen a lot of conspiracy theories flying around wsb recently without much evidence to accompany them most recently i got flooded by comments like this on my data post yesterday commentshttpspreviewredditbaaritypukpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsdbeabffaacaaedaae ampxb the goal of this post was to look at one of those theories and see if i can provide a base for it the theory in question is “$rkt discussion is being artificially pushed to distract from $gme” a tldr of my analysis is a both $rkt and $gme are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on wsb b accounts discussing $gme are actually newer to wsb on average than accounts discussing $rkt c there are a small but nonzero number of people trying to artificially manipulate discussion to get others to sell $gme however this is done with no relation to $rkt d accounts mentioning $gme and $rkt behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks through my analysis i wasnt able to find any solid evidence of $rkt being artificially pushed as a distraction from $gme while its easy to complain about uzjzs ironfisted bot army i think it deserves a lot of credit for curbing attempts at manipulation now i will provide the data backing up these conclusions and call out one account i did find attempting to artificially manipulate discussion ampxb both $rkt and $gme are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on wsb accounts discussing $gme are actually newer to wsb on average than accounts discussing $rkt i dont think i need to patronize you with a bunch of facts and figures showing how much attention has been drawn to wsb recently obviously this attention came with a lot of new posters and thats fully on display when we look at when accounts talking about $gme and $rkt first joined the wsb community the motive behind looking at these numbers was to determine whether there were a bunch of new accounts who joined the community with the sole purpose of distracting from $gme the average $rkt poster first posted on wsb on december th this is pretty shockingly young but the average $gme poster is even newer to the community with an average date of december nd here are histograms showing when the accounts mentioning both stocks first joined the community by year rkt histogramhttpspreviewredditqpypqukpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsccbaeaaeafebeccec gme histogramhttpspreviewredditdkdzuqukpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsfbfcbdefaaaccbd ampxb there is a nonzero number of people trying to manipulate discussion to get others to sell $gme but not enough to have a significant effect one other thing i examined was how much different accounts were shilling $gme and $rkt for the most part there wasnt too much spam of either ticker by individual accounts with a few notable exceptions below are scatter plots showing accounts with the date they joined wsb on the xaxis and the number of times they have mentioned $gme$rkt in the last days on the yaxis $gme date joined vs mentionshttpspreviewredditgvgmqgqukpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsbfccfaceebddbddb $rkt date joined vs mentionshttpspreviewredditaxwqlkqukpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsaebbabbdfebbcfdccdb there are prominent outliers that i will examine one of which i think probably deserves some sort of moderator action on the $gme graph we have ucharg way out in the upper right he just started posting on here yesterday and has been just absolutely spamming antigme shit since although posts like sell you gme stock seem to match the grammar and speech patterns expected of a shortonly investor i dont really see this single example as solid evidence of a larger artificial antigme push on the $rkt side of things we have two accounts that are pretty clearly tied to real people so i dont want to call them out by username while id say theyre pretty clearly innocent of being hedge fund accounts old accounts lots of personal info lots of nonwsb posts theyre absolutely guilty of living in the discussion threads with dozens of comments already today you could probably make an argument that someone commenting about $rkt all day long is having some impact on the overall discussion but given that its just two random dudes i kind of doubt it has much of an effect in the grand scheme of things accounts mentioning $gme and $rkt behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks the last thing i wanted to look at was how accounts behaved in promoting $gme and $rkt in particular i wanted to see if accounts mentioning either stock were more likely to mention it repeatedly i ended up not finding much of a significant difference below is a table where $gme$rkt accounts are defined as accounts mentioning each respective stock ampxb mentions of $rkt$gme over last days$rkt accounts$gme accounts gt gt gt gt ampxb theres a pretty small overlap between people talking about $gme and people talking about $rkt likely leading to some of the conflict that we have seen but from my research i wasnt able to find any solid evidence of $rkt being artificially pushed as a distraction from $gme that being said im happy to hear criticisms on my work let me know below if you have any

lx6cbg,None,N/A,should you buy the dip some research results and dippinator,Discussion,47,0.89,Invnsbl123,30,dont know if this is okay to post it here but would like to get some opinions probably everyone has heard about a saying “buy the dip” i know many believe it is a risky strategy but there are plenty of research suggesting that over sustained time it might be profitable and sound strategy for example this one httpswwwspglobalcommarketintelligenceendocumentsmiresearchqrbuyingthedippdfhttpswwwspglobalcommarketintelligenceendocumentsmiresearchqrbuyingthedippdf below are the results of back testing data httpspreviewredditulebawkpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampseadfcdbacbf if you read the paper you will find that these returns can be improved by using additional screening criteria and company fundamentals conclusion from there “a sharp decline in stock price can signal an investment opportunity if investors can accurately identify which dip to buy and when to buy it it is important to note that no one indicator can ever constitute a solid investment decision on its own and btd is no exception to this rule in this paper we examine several factors that may be used to improve the profitability of the btd strategy our empirical analysis shows that institutional ownership level stock price trend and company valuation can all contribute to the overall success of the btd strategy” now all of this is cool and dandy but how to identify those stocks there are plenty of market screeners that can show you biggest losers of the day but how to know at what point dip the bottom well que in support points some say that using support points is same as predicting future from stars or cards but somehow dips always find their bottom and more often than not its somewhere around previous low points i could not find any freely available tool that could show me tickers that dropped to their support points admittedly i havent looked for very long so decided to build my own – the dippinator i wanted something that gives me a lot of info in a single screen and where i could check the latest news or public opinion about the ticker to get the sentiment behind it took me a few weeks and now i have result – a tool that drops me an email notification when ticker meets certain conditions and falls below rd support point to calculate these points im using the following formulas pivot point pp high low close first resistance r x pp – low first support s x pp – high second resistance r pp high – low second support s pp – high – low third resistance r high pp – low third support s low – high – pp conditions ticker dropped below third support point and possible gain if it reaches st resistance point gt liquidity avg volume todays volume must be more than kk market cap gtkk have been running it for market days it has identified events meeting the criteria above investing same amount $ in all of them would have yielded below results these does not take into account a possibility that position could be sold before close at higher point httpspreviewredditmpcbswkpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampseaebcefeebcabbcd obviously i dont have enough resources to buy each event but i have made some day trades and ended up with gain my biggest gains were from pltr and fgen combination of notification from tool and some manual screening should always give better results as some companies deserve to fall into oblivion furthermore last market days had a lot of volatility so it might not be very representative of future performance im sharing all of this because i think there is a possibility to use dippinator as a pointer where to look problem is that i might be missing something and would like to hear your ideas suggestions or critique on red days it bombards with notifications for example on rd of feb i got notifications it kind of also helps to see early on the trend for the day currently im scanning total of k tickers from us

lx6wl6,None,N/A,unfi dd,DD,49,0.81,reddit_eats_tidepods,43,tldr unfi 💎👐🚀🌕 ive been watching unfi for about years now this post is going to be very basic as the last unfi dd post i read had lots of good information theres no point in repeating the same arguments i have a parttime job at a grocery store for insurance over the last four years ive been watching unfi increase their market share and product offerings while the stock price plummeted early on i noticed a large short interest currently its around and has been for quite some time you have to ask yourself why would there be a large short interest throughout a pandemic for a dine at home stock one could certainly argue the mismanaged acquisition of svu greatly contributed to this however something that i have not heard mentioned in any due diligence report on unfi is the lawsuit against goldman sachs for the unfair terms of the loan it was around this period in time that i began to notice how large is the short interest was it is my guess and opinion because of this lawsuit unfi is being punished by way of short interest i have not heard anyone mention this as a potential reason for such a high short interest during the last four years i have seen unfi gobble up a significant amount of brands increasing their distribution to our store from about of our product offering line to well over dont take my word for it you can go into any grocery store and look at the tag on the shelf and it will tell you which distributor the product comes from if youve been paying attention to this and who would you would find a consistent increase in their market share in fact recently they acquired qfc locations in my area this tells me more than any potential amazon contract i in fact dont care whether or not they get the amazon go stores because i think those will flop in the longterm that being said a lot of people are looking at the amazon contract as a sign of success and its my opinion that they will retain that contract but i couldnt care less let us know talk cerebrally about their shipping issues recently i saw three drivers unloading a unfi truck and i jokingly asked them if they were union drivers having three people control one truck they responded by saying no they were training new drivers from jb hunt to deliver their products in my area this replaces a complicated intricate system of independent owner operators consolidating their shipping costs into one account as opposed to hundreds of accounts is going to save them a lot of money my bottom line is that unfi continually increases their market share and the synergies will be realized from the svu acquisition in fairly short order this is my yolo play and im planning on holding it upwards of $ a share my guess is that we could reach over $ a share within two years as you can see in my previous post i hold shares if i could create a gif for this stock it would be a turtle with a rocket strapped to its back on a skateboard someone posted this exact gif on yahoo finance board and it is so accurate i feel very comfortable with this stock and although i check it multiple times a day its not something that i need to do i sleep like a baby at night one thing that i will caution yall about is the earnings reports never send the stock skyrocketing in fact last earnings report they crushed it and their stock did absolutely nothing over the week after earnings this is of absolutely no concern to me when you have a high short interest and low volume trading this sort of thing is to be expected a negative point about this company very important to include in an unbiased assessment is the general silence from the board about what theyre doing however im looking at this through the lens of theyre too busy expanding their business instead of making hyped up press releases and this just gives me more confidence in the stock for the mid and longterm this is the way,2021-03-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx6wl6/unfi_dd/

lxq24n,UWMC,1.04%,united wholesale mortgage $uwmc bull thesis from a real estate professional,DD,1080,0.78,MadeToOrderName,465,ive been building a position in united wholesale mortgage $uwmc for months now since their merger was announced and with these prices i decided to offer some dd to any members of this sub with the ability to hold more than one stonk in their portfolio tldr uwmc is better than rkt and i think its better for both the shortterm traders and the longhold investors i have read a lot of great analysis of their financials all over reddit recently so i wont bore with too many details but the high altitude view goes as follows went public with a $b valuation based on only three quarters of x multiple on adjusted income in q alone they did $b in net income which means their q reporting towards the end of april is going to be massive at todays price the dividend yield is over annually exdividend date is this coming tuesday meaning if youre going to buy do it before tuesday march th it was announced this week theyll be included in the russell and russell index beginning march nd which means extra buying necessity between now and earnings for the semiretarded members here this means tons of net buying between now and march nd because of index inclusion dividend bonus and earnings runup ampxb now as a realtor id like to add some professional analysis here and ill touch on rkt briefly too because theyre being compared a lot due to sector similarity but their models are totally different ampxb it doesnt matter what mortgage rates are mortgage originators always make x margin on every loan they sell what matters is the number of purchases and refis ie how many widgets they sell nationwide there is a massive shortage of housing supply because people are simply not moving which means when things return to normal well see x x x and in some markets even x the number of homes being sold which translates to the same number of new loans being originated profits are way higher on new purchases vs refis so while nobody is turning refis down their marketing dollars are spent generating loans on new purchases anybody who tuned in to uwmcs final sales call of for their national reps heard their ceo matt ishba talking about how theyd spend the money theyd get from going public and he was all about relationships relationships with realtors particularly but also with other real estate spheres in influence insurance agents title companies etc rkt has great market share but realtors hate when clients consider using them because they frequently take way longer to close a loan than what is considered normal weeks right now originators like the salespeople working through uwmc have a major competitive advantage against rocket and others because they close deals fast that is all that matters to realtors and realtors are often the person that is pointing people in the direction of the lending option rkt may get a lot of market share for refis the lower profitability loans but uwmc is poised to get a growing share of higher profit new purchase volume especially as supply of homes for sale new and preowned increases to meet demand now anybody who has either considered selling a home recently or buying a home recently knows this but for those not in those categories the real estate market is insane right now think melvin capital scrounging for gme shares to cover their shorts in the biggest gamma squeeze cycle ever insane mediocre homes are selling for over asking price within days of hitting the market and buyers are fomoing hardcore into paying these escalating prices thats a great thing for sellers but doesnt do anything good or bad for uwmc holders ampxb this is what matters for uwmc investors as inventory increases which it will because in some states covid made it near impossible to sell in and as prices become to normalize causing more people to want to move because it wont be insanely expensive on the buy side the volume of high profit loans for new purchases will increase again it doesnt matter if interest rates go up a little its not like theyre going to double interest rates are at all time lows as seen here from freddie machttpwwwfreddiemaccompmmspmmshtml and that isnt going to change for years to come uwmc pays a regular dividend is about to announce an insane q on or around april rd and since theyre the largest originator of loans in the country they will absolutely see a rising price moving forward into shortterm traders best bet for you is to buy slightly otm april or may calls personally id buy may calls but with the intention of selling them during the earnings runup if that happens andor holding them through er if the runup isnt significant enough due to the markets overall vibe right now buying may calls gives you extra insurance which i like but degens should stick to april and save the premim long term investors at current prices between $share today if youre not buying now than there is no helping you ive bought at levels as low as $ and as high as $ and im comfortable anywhere in that range i dont think a price of $ by years end is unreasonable once the company has steady quarterly growth figures for bigger investors to buy in with i believe well see over $share only if the market as a whole starts humming along and only if local home sale inventory returns to levels and id guesstimate that is shot tldr again tons of net buying between now and march nd because of index inclusion dividend bonus and earnings runup in april ampxb proof of my share position httpsimgurcombagwhttpsimgurcombagw ampxb my buy orders today are set shares $ filled shares $ filled shares $ shares $ shares $ ampxb again this is just the bull thesis i think a few decent bearish points have been made elsewhere that i can get behind but most have to deal with mortgages being unsexy or the company being young and untested well making money is sexy to me i dont know about you fruits most of the members here are young and untested too probably spreading stis all over your local areas via grinder before covid good luck to all happy trading and lets expand our horizons a little like the old days of wsb ampxb edit uelsandavid was kind enough to point out below that a director recently bought shares on march st and the average analyst rating is $ edit adding this amazing articlehttpswwwfreepcomstorymoneybusinessunitedwholesalemortgageultimatumrocketcompanies where the ceo of uwm matt ishbia walked into the room for his facebook

course of three days has some deeeeeepfuckiinngggpockets they have more money thats a fucking fact compound that with this buyers breakeven at $ it logically follows we have found our new baseline price for gme let me explain consider all this information with what happened yesterday gme closed at $ just cents above this buyers breakeven what ensued in ah a backandforth teetertotter throughout the entire ah session ultimately every time gme dropped below $ it hit a springboard back above the closing price and finally finished at $ flat in sum i believe the new baseline price is $ relying on my aforementioned ability to deduce logical reasoning i am resolute in my opinion that this big bag dickslanger will be valiantly defending hisher breakeven price at $ do not get this confused with them giving a fuck about us or anyone else they might but its in their own best interest to hold that line whether it benefits us or not is probably the least of their concern furthermore think about it yourself if you dropped a combined $m in three consecutive days you must have a contingency plan it is my belief that this multihundred millionaire potentially billionaire has much deeper pockets than what they leveraged on the options theyll almost assuredly be using millions more to ensure the success of their $m options play i would be remissed if i didnt acknowledge theres a slight possibility this person is just a dumbass ape like us hitting a ballsdeep yolo play with his entire trustfund inheritance but i doubt it in the event my hypothesis checks out gme is currently sitting at its new support level this is bullish and provides a good buying opportunity tldr i believe the new baseline price for gme is $ this is the breakeven price of a huge fucking whale that spent $m $m if exercised on call options spanning the last three days march stmarch rd with that in mind gme closed yesterday at $ just cents above this buyers breakeven to go further every time gme dropped below $ in the ah session it hit a springboard back above the closing price and finally finished at $ flat it is my belief that this multihundred millionaire potentially billionaire has much deeper pockets than what they leveraged out on the options theyll assuredly be using millions more to ensure the success of their $m options play which means keeping the price above their $ breakeven ampxb

ly4ykn,SNDL,-23.40%,why im holding $sndl and plan to buy more,DD,92,0.68,YerBuhdFinn,113,none of this is financial advice nor am i telling anyone to buysell stock this is my opinion based on the most recent public information i could find your investment choices are yours alone and im not a professional by any stretch this is a casino now with that out of the way the reason sndl is currently down is a combination of hedgefund shorting daytrade usage but also simple market correction it looks like most cannabis stocks have undergone a market correction this week im not that worried im just gonna hope that their next financial statement is sexy and that the next one is even sexier despite its infancy as a company i believe sundial growers is drastically undervalued and can become highly competitive i personally plan to hold for awhile at the time of writing this sndl is at a dip and i dont think it will last long this company is far more than a pnd my plan is to go for a long hold and buy more when i have the chance this is why consider the following recently acquired nasdaq compliance if the value of their stock stays above $ by june theyll maintain that compliance and likely be in good shape to keep up their upward trend on dec sundial announced that it has paid off all debts compared to other cannabis companies this is huge their new equity allowed them secure $m in cash they should be stable for the foreseeable future sundial growers has undergone management changes presumably because of the number of serious setbacks in previous years mold fires air circulation issues everything you dont want to see in a cannabis company in january they have switched out torsten kuenzlen for zachary george while this could be a reason to be alarmed heres a quote from newswireca mr george brings a wealth of experience to sundial having spent more than years evaluating catalystbased investment opportunities across the capital structure of north american companies with a focus on real assets  mr george has worked in a management capacity including as a chief executive officer with numerous corporate boards to turn around operations effect corporate action and implement governance policies in order to maximize shareholder value mr george cofounded the alternative investment platform frontfour capital group llc and currently serves as a trustee and director on the boards of cominar reit and trez capital junior mic  he previously served as the chairman of the boards of fam reit and huntingdon capital corp as the lead independent director of both cornell companies inc and pw eagle inc and on the boards of allied defense group inc and iat air cargo facilities income fund now consider the fact that despite having to solve these issues they managed to become debt free i believe the credit can be attributed to their new management and their financial restructuring earlier this month they had a market cap of b its currently b an incoming b market cap is not unrealistic and legalization efforts around the world will likely increase the market cap for multiple cannabis companies not just sndl american legalization does matter here just because they are canadian doesnt mean they wont export product to the us same goes for any other nonamerican cannabis company americans love weed and cannabis companies know it whether or not legalization happens this year its a political inevitability at this point sundial has also been making moves that suggest expansion efforts quote from nasdaqcom theres one company thats been of interest to sundial growers of late and thats microcap cannabis stock zenabis otc zbisf on dec sundial announced it had acquired a special purpose vehicle that at the time owned million canadian dollars worth of zenabiss senior secured debt sundial will also collect a royalty under the agreement of between and depending on the companys net cannabis revenue zenabis made a payment on that debt of ca$ million on dec but sundial still issued it a notice of default zenabis contests the default and in a statement issued on jan says that sundial made such investment in an attempt to coerce zenabis into being acquired by sundial zenabis says that prior to sundials investment it was in discussions with its lender to get an extension on its ca$ million debt repayment as of sept the company reported cash and cash equivalents of just ca$ million and so liquidity is a clear concern for zenabis this quote is what is making me hopeful about their next earnings report on march a lot of investing and stock websites ie motley fool are advising against sndl thankfully were retarded if my time on this subreddit has taught me anything its a sign that they want the price to stay low in my personal opinion their analysis is shallow and probably motivated by hedgefund worries when it comes to cannabis companies i dont rely on revenue info alone plenty of cannabis companies are struggling to be profitable sundial is preparing to release a new line of products with higher thc potency to meet the increasing customer demands they have made some drastic adaptations to their cultivation processes over the last six months and according to their new ceo the nature of sundial growing facilities enables the company to stay on their toes quote from zachary george ceo since inception weve compiled a broad spectrum of cultivation statistics including more than harvests including in and in the third quarter alone sundial has leveraged his data analytics capabilities to focus on key improvement areas i am proud to say that just last month in october we generated the highest average potency results since sundials inception…” sundial has also gotten ahold of some promising cannabis genetics which they expect to have tangible financial impact in they have also been able to slash their costs and improve their efficiency ceo quote we exited q with lower costs greater efficiencies and dramatic improvements to our balance sheet despite underperforming on revenue we reached several key operating milestones as we continue to improve our processes we are also working to elevate our customer experience while driving longterm growth…” found on yahoo finance after reading through their financial statements can confirm and last but not least its weed i love weed and i like the stock i feel bullish on $sndl,2021-03-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ly4ykn/why_im_holding_sndl_and_plan_to_buy_more/
ly5d87,NVAX,-23.81%,nvax update confusion and panic is driving the latest selloff nvax is a massive bargain at $share time to load the boat 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,DD,44,0.75,Upstairs_Speech,66,tldr nvax is down over in the last trading sessions and since the ath days ago and now has a market cap of $b this is an enormous overreaction for a company that has reported the highest efficacy to date against the original covid variant and has several billions of dollars in advanced purchase agreements for if trading at close to x pricesales anticipated isnt enough nvax is also the most well positioned vaccine maker to capitalize on the future booster market due to the ability to combine multiple strains in one shot and their excellent safety profile nvax is an incredible deal right now at $share refer to my previous posts for more background and a more thorough explanation of nvaxs vaccine particularly my last post on recap of how we got here on january th nvax reported best in class interim results from their phase uk trial efficacy against original covid variant which led to shares massively increasing over the following couple of weeks peaking at over $share see summary figure from ra capital below outlining nvaxs vaccine performance against the competition since then several advanced purchased agreements have been confirmedfinalized and nvax has secured orders for m doses which ceo has indicated will be $dose additionally nvax has confirmed agreements for b doses that will be supplied through exclusive license agreements with japan south korea and indiacovax nvax completed enrollment for usmexico phase trial on february nd and will likely report interim results in march earnings on march st provided several important updates around manufacturing and development of a new bivalent covid vaccine however the market reacted negatively likely due to expectations around an update for the uk phase trial completion and us eua shares continued to slide over the last days due to broader market conditions closing at $share today httpspreviewredditutbuipyndlpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsedbcbbbcabeddedafbce nvax remains well positioned despite being behind pfe mrna and jnj based on several comments ive seen over the past few days it seems that many people are not aware that there is a massive market for covid vaccines outside of the us and that nvax already has an agreement with the us to provide m doses yes the us is vaccinating millions of people every week but weve known for months that nvax was going to be approved after pfemrnajnj and nothing has changed on that front for the first wave of vaccinations the us market was never going to be the major revenue generator for nvax it was always going to be about the exus market for as of today nvax has advanced purchase agreements with the following countries that will likely pay top tier pricing which ceo suggested earlier this week will be $dose canada m doses w option for additional m doses uk m doses australia m doses w option for additional m doses new zealand m doses switzerland m doses this does not include ongoing negotiations with the eu which have been reportedhttpswwwreuterscomarticleushealthcoronaviruseunovavaxeuclosetovaccinesupplydealwithnovavaxsourcesiduskbnabh to involve supplying m doses with an option for another m there will almost certainly be several more countries that come forward with purchases in the coming weeks during the earnings call on monday ceo confirmed that all manufacturing sites are making gmp product with us and sk performing final fill this is an important update and it appears that manufacturing will be able to deliver on projected supply of m dosesmonth once all sites are fully operational in mid ampxb new covid variants p amp b can escape prior immunity to original covid variants and vaccination with stgeneration covid vaccines several lines of evidence make it clear that at least two of the covid variants in circulation are capable of immune escape this is a big deal because it means that existing vaccines will be less effective as weve already seen and will need to be updated in the future it also isnt hard to imagine that in another months after more of the population has been vaccinated that selection pressure will generate additional escape mutants that well need to think about ultimately this means that were very likely going to need updated covid vaccines with some level of frequency nvax and mrna are already working on bivalent formulations that will cover at least two variants and theres very good reason to think there will be more updates in the next few years due to the nature of their vaccine platform nvax is best positioned to take advantage of updated booster shots in the future i went through this in more detail in my last post but to summarize nvaxs high potency allows them to use a very low dose of protein µg in their current formulation and they tested up to µg during phase trials with no change in side effects as a result they have the “space” to add coverage against several additional variants and have confirmed that theyre already working on this pfemrna have much less “space” to add coverage against additional variants due to dose limiting toxicity as theyre already relatively close to the ceiling of how much mrna can be delivered in a dose without causing unacceptable levels of toxicity safety issues are already a concern with the existing formulation particularly for mrna which was the subject of a recent new england journal of medicine paper nejm paperhttpswwwnejmorgdoifullnejmcqueryfeaturedhome consequently mrnas bivalent booster is being developed to cover two variants at half of the original dose to keep the total mrna at µg still safety remains a concern since we see an increase in side effects going from dose to dose due to an unknown mechanism and there are concerns that there will be a similar issue going from dose to dose jnj and azns platform use adenoviral vector platform to deliver the dna sequence encoding the antigen both suffer from the same problem which is that the immune system recognizes the vector and impairs the efficacy of subsequent vaccinations ampxb nvax will be able to leverage their best in class platform against new variants and will be able to take advantage of an expedited pathway to get updated formulations approved in the future based on recent fda guidance linkhttpswwwfdagovmediadownload as a result future trials will be able to take place much faster and the speed advantage for mrnabased platforms will be significantly negated compared to the first round of trials nvax is undervalued at $share even before considering how massive the revenues for boosters could be nvax is insanely cheap at an $b market cap i havent performed any financial modeling so im not going to give a price target beyond saying its much higher than $ instead ill point you to the only four analysts whove provided updated price targets since earnings on march st eric joseph jp morgan $share kelechi chikere jefferies $share charles duncan cantor fitzgerald $share mayank mamtani b riley $share ampxb httpspreviewredditufnkaselpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsebffbae for comparison two other covid vaccine makers cvac and bntx have market caps of $b and $b respectively cvac has no approved products and a covid vaccine that appears significantly less effective and is at an earlier phase of development bntx is the inventor of pfes vaccine and shares revenue with pfe yes both cvac and bntx are getting a premium for their pipelines but nvax has a pipeline as well with a flu vaccine that successfully completed phase prior to the pandemic and an rsv vaccine in clinical development both of which are candidates to be made into combination vaccines with their covid vaccine ampxb positions shares $ $ $ bought on the way down might be a little aggressive right now $ $ $ a few of these were spreads that i closed the short leg on today during the selloff spreads are a good option for nvax bc of the high premium $$ call spreads ampxb this wont be in the s much longer

ly6b5k,None,N/A,inflation expectations part,DD,304,0.94,Camposaurus_Rex,109,okay retards time to talk economics and hyperinflation grow some wrinkles wanna know why the market has been red lately jpow is saying fuck your calls httpswwwforbescomsitessarahhansennotatalllikelyuswillreachmaximumemploymentthisyearfedchairpowellshefdchttpswwwforbescomsitessarahhansennotatalllikelyuswillreachmaximumemploymentthisyearfedchairpowellshefdc asked about the risks that inflation and overheating pose to the larger economy powell doubled down on previous statements and reiterated that the fed does not plan to adjust its policy until it sees significant evidence of maximum employment in the labor market among other conditions itll take some time to get there” he said noting that inflation is also running well below the feds target section hyperinflation is coming lets go back to some basics thanks to our current banking system we live in a debtbased society where our goal is to pull out a loan for interest and make gains now everyone wants to be a chad with an infinite money glitch trying to compete for the same slices of pie so now we have a problem for example i have tendies and you have bananas and we decide a tendie to banana rate is nice and life is good all of a sudden fucking chad mcdonkeykong says he has bananas and he wants to trade with me so now we have bananas in circulation and only tendies i now agree that the exchange rate is tendies to bananas and now youre down on your banana trade fucking chad thats inflation for you more money is added into circulation and therefore you need more of it to buy the same goods now lets say your girlfriend gets pissed at chad mcdickface for putting too many bananas in the banana market why would she lol so he pulls out bananas now with bananas in circulation and tendies the exchange rate is tendies to bananas guess who just made tendies fuck ya you did now youre only down from when chad entered the market thats deflation for you money is removed from circulation and there you need less of it to buy the same goods ya i know that already retard get to the point if we look at the uss monetary base blue and the feds balance sheet red you can clearly see theres a lot more bananas in circulation inflation ampxb httpsfredstlouisfedorggraphfredgraphpnggbd httpspreviewredditbygjfjqlpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampscdcaeddeffcfdeacab not quite economists use cpi consumer price index to collect information about pricing on goods services and loans in the economy its got some flaws but its been reliable enough to account for inflation for the last few hundreds of years so well stick with this as our metric 📷 httpsfredstlouisfedorgseriescpiaucsl httpspreviewredditxucmqlpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsecccbcabdfaeedebcc see that majestic big black dick arrow we call that steady inflation and the fed likes this around year over year yoy for optimal market and economic growth and stability i recall hearing is about the average that most growing societies experienced as well so it seems like a sweet spot for us humans to operate so what does it mean in order to stay ahead of all the new chads pulling out loans and yoloing you need to increase your net worth by at least this amount per year real returns are when you factor in taxes on assetsgains and this tend to lower it anyhow lets see what the data says about inflation and qe

httpspreviewredditsznbwvcyqlpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsadfebfddef meh section this time is different okay so what the fuck were on rounds of qe and no hyper inflation i thought the fed was an infinite money glitch so how does this qe infinite money pinata work first of all qe is a sum zero exchange its primary objective is to drive interest rates on treasury securities to and thereby decrease interest rates the bank can loan at home loans credit card loans etc so how does it work its something like this primary dealer bank goes to the bond market looking for some tendies normally they would only buy $ worth of tendies but papa jpow is mother fucking huuuungray so they buy $ worth of tendies each time they go shopping this is fine if the bond market had infinitely supply but it doesnt the us will only be issue so much debt so each time the supply gets shrunk a little bit so over time well start to see a supply shortage remember bonds are retarded so when the price goes up interest rates and yields go down fucking magic jpow is trying to forcing a mother fucking supply shortage in bond market so whats jpow doing with these gay bonds see daddy jpow is worried that these little bitch ass banks jpm wfc etc are going to go full retard again like in so hes shoving all these bonds in safes and locking that shit up until were back to normal in exchange for the $ tendies hes giving these ass hats $ cash so they can keep jerking each other off as long as they dont yolo it into the markets and economy life is good daddy jpow also knows he can keep doing this qe trick until bond prices go to infinity but negative interest rates are kind of a pain to deal with now at the same time these smaller banks arent as retarded as we think they are and they also dont want to fail like in and theyve learned a thing or two sure papa jpow can throw money at them again but he already locked up some of their fun money and he was pretty pissed last time so the easiest thing to do right now is buy these dumb ass bond for cheap and sell them to daddy jpow for some easy gains they also know many of us are fucked without jobs so why even risk lending right now so banks are buying bonds jpow has a safe and banks arent lending nothing new here well the take away here is that all that money jpow is printing is stuck in the banks and the banks dont want to lend it out a good way to show this is the m velocity which shows how many times money changes hands before money is destroyed its like this monkey a borrows banana from chad mcshittyass monkey a buys tendies off monkey b monkey b gives banana back to chad in this case the banana went from c gt a gt b gt c since chad created the banana and destroyed the banana he doesnt count in the transaction so its just a amp b that matter in this case the m velocity would be now lets look at how qe affects us httpsfredstlouisfedorggraphgbdgp httpspreviewredditplzgauxrlpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsacaeaedaebade were currently sitting at an abysmal in the mv right now compared to an average of we from the s until the s so that means people arent spending were in a dollar shortage well no shit we cant go anywhere and buy shit yep and to top it off banks are still not lending with all that jerk off money they got from papa jpow any time the blue line is above the black one it means banks are tightening lending restrictions as you can see banks are still tightening their lending right now smart people are paying off debt right now but this destroys money in the process httpsfredstlouisfedorggraphgqw

m2h3yu,None,N/A,this is why the squeeze hasnt even started to begin and that was nowhere near the peak,DD,7,0.89,Gum6789,31,i am smooth brained but here is my logic for why the hedges havent covered the squeeze hasnt begun and i am more bullish than ever even by conservative estimations of how fucked they are $ peak wouldnt be anywhere close to them being able to cover all their shorts if the price rise was from them covering who the fuck was erecting sell walls seems very counterintuitive to cuck your own plan if that were the case the ceo of interactive brokers let slip live on air that gme was running into the thousands before buying was halted in january since then the hedge funds have dug themselves into a much much deeper hole figures is now a very conservative amount per share this is speculation but youd imagine there would be dialogue between the dtcc and shitadel if they had it under control either they had a convincing means to stop the squeeze or eat the peak then i doubt the dtcc would have been concerned enough to try push through the new rules shitadel and co could eat up a $ peak and not go bankrupt the fuckery and data shows they are petrified of us passing $$ i think we could be nearing a price where they could be margin called be north of those numbers why are they still weaponising the media to convince us gme is dead they are desperate for us to know it is over if they had it under control they would just short it down without much fuss to the price they can close their positions at the hfs arent stupid and wouldnt have shorted it so much to get us on the ssr there are definitely big players on our side who know what they are doing i think we were ahead of a lot of peoples price estimates and we still have so many catalysts to come quad witching stimmies cohen becoming ceo all of these will spike interest and the price yes the bear trap seemed to come out of nowhere after such a steady rise but diamond hands are formed under pressure and it was never going to be a smooth journey i believe the german market will boost us back up to $s for a fresh run at $ today there is plenty of other more technical dd out there and some of mine may be speculative but thought might be worth sharing,2021-03-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2h3yu/this_is_why_the_squeeze_hasnt_even_started_to/

m3i8kc,None,N/A,how to keep your newly minted title of millionaire,Discussion,8,0.9,Goaliescottie,1027,so you did it you did your due diligence you did the math you summoned your courage to press that buy button and now those stocks and options have granted you a title you only dreamed of having millionaire congratulations you beat the odds that so many before you have failed to overcome you played the game and came out on top now its time to buy that house you always dreamed of or that car you always wanted to drive right sure if you want to lose your title of millionaire however if you d like to stay a millionaire there are some things you may like to consider this is not financial advice but rather pieces of life suggestions a survival guide so to speak of the next months and how to protect your new title ampxb first protect it from everyone else dont tell anybody if there is one thing you take away from this let it be this so let me repeat that dont tell anyone this is going to be your most well kept secret in your life you will probably feel the urge to tell your friends and your family but doing this will ruin your life why well everyone is gonna want a cut theyre gonna say they need that new device or they need that new car or they need this or that theyll bring up how far you go back suddenly youll see the very people who have been your friends turn on you like vultures they may think they have your best interests in mind and they may not the harm theyre causing but theyll smell money and theyre gonna come asking in that case youve gotta be the bad guy youve gotta be the one to say no and friendships are going to quickly fall apart as you deny them or youre gonna bleed your money helping everyone while they take advantage of you and indulge their overspending habits to put it differently this isnt a question of who do you tell because word spreads rather this is a question of social survival do you want to maintain your relationship with your friends and family yes then keep it to yourself money talks but wealth whispers ampxb second protect it from expenses if you want this money to last more than years youre gonna want to treat it as if it wasnt there wait what then why do i have this money if im not gonna use it you will use it just not as a sum of cash if you have $ million you are not going to go out and buy a $ million dollar house and a $ lamborghini youll only have $ left instead you might want to turn to fire or financial independence retire early there you are going to use your newfound money as a source of income an easy equation for this is thats it thats the equation of your net worth can be used yearly while your money still sits in investments and accrues roughly interest annually this way you beat inflation and you cover your expenses so to use our $ million under the rule thats $ you can spend annually and in theory you will never run out of funds while never working another day in your life or if you enjoy what youre doing you can add that to the equation as well how you break it up is up to you but you can very easily spend north of $ a year and still be in the green if you hold down a job meanwhile lets check in on our $ thats $ a year you can spend for the rest of your life if you wanted to retire today thats uncomfortably close to poverty you dont deserve that ampxb third protect it from yourself yes yourself as quickly as you made your money you can easily lose it in the best weeks of your life so right now emotions are probably high youre beyond excited you are itching to do something crazy with your money and probably want to buy something since you cant tell anyone per part dont buy anything right now yes you read that right dont buy anything if you need any proof on that look up what happens to lottery winners roughly of which go bankrupt rather set the money aside for a while you can determine this amount of time but a good rule of thumb is months in those months it gives you plenty of time to calm yourself collect your thoughts and figure out an actual plan on how to wisely use that money how you want to invest it how much you want to use per year and how much you owe in taxes yes the dreaded tword taxes youve gotta pay up and during that planning process youll have to come to terms with what this money is going to do for your life ampxb so there you have it a starter guide on how to survive your first days as a new millionaire written by someone who has never been a millionaire but i have seen some people make some awful mistakes about money and did my due diligence on what happens after someone gains a massive windfall and i have a feeling that more than a handful of you might be seeing a windfall come your way in the near future ampxb to close they say money cant buy you happiness but im often reminded of the scene from captain america httpsiredditzrwsfsstlmgif money is only going to amplify how you want to live your life if you want to live generously leaving anonymous gifts and donations giving all you have away you can do that if you want to live egregiously expensive and live it up over spending at every turn you can also do that but you will need to face the consequences of either decision and if you in your nature default to one of these paths but dont want to it will take all the more effort to avoid it than if you didnt have this money at all ampxb oh who am i kidding this is wallstreetbets you will all be fine just be careful my friends as this is a fight that may last the rest of your life,2021-03-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3i8kc/how_to_keep_your_newly_minted_title_of_millionaire/

m4a87a,None,N/A,i teach high school which means i explain things to idiots every day if you still dont understand call options i got you,Discussion,47,0.89,The_Superbus,3162,i see a lot of people asking basic questions about calls on just about every thread that mentions them so here you go note before the finance majors come out and nitpick small things remember that this is a basic primer for idiots some of it has been simplified what is a call option basics a call option hereafter referred to simply as a call is a contract that gives you the ability though not the obligation to buy shares of a stock for a specific price by a specific date called the expiration date example you buy a $ call for gme that expires on march th what that means is that at any time between now and endofday on you can buy shares of gme for $ if the price spikes to $ dollars you can still buy them for $ thats a pretty good deal so i need the price of gme to get to $ to break even and anything above that is profit right not quite you have to pay a premium for the option which is the amount of money youre giving to the option seller in exchange for the contract the premium is listed as the price per share so if the option has a $ premium that means that you have to pay $ per share of gme in the contract which means that you pay $ the buy the call $share x shares you give the seller $ and they give you the call option since you paid $ for the option this means that your break even price is $ dollars per share why because if the price only got to $ you could have bought it for $share without buying the contract which means the money you spend on the contract was a waste however if the price goes to $share then you make a profit because you effectively paid $share for a stock worth $share but what if the price doesnt go up or even goes down do i have to still buy those shares for $ no you never have to buy the shares if you dont want to remember a call gives you the ability to buy shares for $ but not the obligation but what if the price of gme goes way up but i dont have $ around to buy shares at $share then you sell the contract to someone who either does have $ sitting around or slightly advanced info here that you dont need to know to someone who is trying to offset a position regardless of who buys it they will pay you a lot of money for your option because it is itm or in the money what does that mean lets look at some option vocabulary call option vocabulary strike price this is the price that you are allowed to pay for the stock per the contract in our $ call option above the strike price is $ at any time before the expiration date you are allowed to exercise the contract the contract and pay $share for the stock exercise exercising an option means you are exercising your ability to buy the shares of stock in the example above you would spend $ for shares of stock regardless of the stocks price at the time can i exercise and only buy shares of stock no if you cant afford to exercise then you can sell your option to someone else expiration date this is when your call expires if you have a expiration date that means that your call option is no longer good after premium the premium is the price you pay to the callseller for the contract and it is listed as the price per share knowing that how much will it cost to buy an option with a premium of if you do the math it will cost you $ which is share x shares itm and otm in the money and out of the money itm calls are calls for which the stock price has exceeded the strike price if you have a $ call and the price of gme goes to $ then your call is itm because you can buy a $ stock for $ if you then immediately sold the stock for $ youd make money otm calls are calls for which the stock price is below the strike price if you have a $ call and the price of gme is $ then your call is otm it is important to realize that being itm doesnt mean being profitable in the example above of the $ call with a $ premium if gme goes to $ you are itm because gt but you havent broken even yet because your breakeven price is $ fds fd is not an investment term and you dont need to know what it means in order to understand calls it is a wsb term and it stands for maggots delight but with an f because autmod wont let me define fds fds are otm calls with short expirations and as such are a huge gamble the guy who spent k on dte day to expiration otm gme callshttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsmrvfoundouthowtobuycalloptionsyesterday those were all fds and they all expired worthless why are they called fds because when you buy fds you usually end up taking it in the ass when people list their option positions they use a bunch of numbers and letters that i dont understand how do i figure out what theyre talking about you have probably seen something like this gme $c lets break it down gme $c the gme stands for gamestop which you probably figured out the $c is a call option with a strike price of $ if it said $p it would be a put option but well talk about those later the stands for the expiration date now lets make it more complicated if i said i bought $ gme $c what do i mean it means that i bought ten contracts of gme $ calls with a expiration and i paid $ per share if i paid $ per share how much did i spend on my contracts i spent $ $share x shares x contracts now you try it a $ call on gme that expires next week costs around seven bucks a share how would you explain to me that you bought two of them you would say that you bought $ gme $c now you can look like you know what youre talking about even though you still probably dont why do people buy call options this is confusing why do people even do this people buy call options because you can make a lot of money if you have the right to buy shares of something for a fixed price then for every $ the share price goes above your breakeven price you make $ if you have a $c with a break even of $ and the price gets to $ then you make $ profit thats $ of profit $$ times shares you can buy the shares and hold them or you can buy them and sell them immediately to realize that profit or you can sell the contract to someone else and just take the money it is usually better to sell the contract but thats not an important distinction because most of you cant afford to exercise anyway and will be selling contracts why are calls dangerous when you buy a stock at least you own the stock if you buy an option and it expires worthless then you have nothing if the guy who bought k worth of fds had bought k worth of gme and held then hed still have somewhere around k worth of gme depending on when he bought on thursday instead he has nothing why does the value of my call keep changing so you bought a call option and every time you look at it its worth a different amount of money thats because there are actually two types of value in an option options have intrinsic value and extrinsic value intrinsic value is the exercisable value of the option if you own a $c and the price is $ then the intrinsic value of the option is $share or $ because thats the value you would get if you exercised it right now as stock price goes up intrinsic value goes up pretty easy extrinsic value has a more complicated definition so were going to call extrinsic value the potential the option has and that potential is based on time and volatility for example if there is a long time before expiration then that means that there is more potential for the option to go itm because more time more chances for the price to rise therefore options further from expiration will be worth more than options close to expiration conversely less time to expiration less value which means that your option can constantly lose value as time goes on and the number of chances you have to go itm decreases this is called theta decay but you dont need to worry about that volatility is the second part of extrinsic value and options for stocks that are more volatile can be worth more than options for stocks that trade steadily because if a stock price swings wildly up and down theres a greater chance that one of those upswings will put you itm this is reflected in a measurement called iv or implied volatility like theta decay iv is a more advanced concept that you dont need to understand now as long as you get the basics due to the factors of time theta and volatility iv constantly changing the extrinsic value of your option will also change over time this is why the value of your option will constantly change is the stock calming down and starting to trade sideways low volatility your option value will decrease as iv drops is the stock starting to jump around your option value will increase as iv increases sometimes the stock price can be climbing slowly but the value of your option can be decreasing why do you think that is if the stock value is increasing slowly but youre way otm and running out of time because your option expires tomorrow the downward price pressure of theta decay can overcome the upward price pressure of volatility and stock price rise and your option value can decrease i bought a call and im itm howwhen do i sell my contracts you can sell your contracts at any time you dont have to wait until the expiration to sell your contracts this is good because if the price spikes you can dump your options for profit and move on there was a point yesterday when k fd guys and calls were itm when gme spiked to if he had sold then he wouldnt have lost everything by waiting until expiration i bought a call and im itm howwhen do i exercise my contracts make sure that you have enough money to cover buying all the shares and click the exercise button they get your money and you get their shares this can take some time ok i get it but can you give me a tldr just in case i actually dont get it a call option is a contract to buy shares of a stock at a certain price to buy the contract you pay a premium to the contract seller if the price of the stock goes above the price of your contract you can either buy the shares or sell the contract for profit the end so im an expert now and can go yolo everything on calls and make money no you have a basic understanding of how calls work and know just enough to be dangerous dont go crazy buy a call see how it works for real dont yolo your life savings on your newfound knowledge or do live your life how you want im not your dad just make sure you post the porn when you win or

people try to make a stupid persons guide to how options work and being really irresponsible about explaining theta i have a few points i want to make about theta then hopefully we can put this to rest im not going to talk about delta or iv thats a different conversation and motherfuckers need to read real quick not a pro not investment advice advice about how you need to actually learn shit if youre too retarded to understand basic math or youre too lazy to try to actually better yourself then click the back button now for the retards that stick around ill include pictures and a fun little story okay about of you should be left so lets dive in theta the term theta refers to the rate of decline in the valuehttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsvvalueasp of an option due to the passage of time it can also be referred to as the time decayhttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsttimedecayasp of an option this means an option loses value as time moves closer to its maturityhttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsmmaturitydateasp as long as everything is held constant theta is generally expressed as a negative number and can be thought of as the amount by which an options value declines every day theta is an estimate of value decay its a rate thats continuously adjusted every second that passes makes your option worth less and less the biggest misconception is the one i want to focus on the most we talk about it it terms expressed in decay on a day i think for our simple brains but its not that simple just like days arent really exactly hours and theres complex reasons why theta is not linear you dickheads remember ymxb from middle school thats linear heres theta on an option graphed for a yr contract ampxb httpswwwoptiontradingtipscomgreeksthetahtmlhttpspreviewredditkzpzuyfzvmpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampseccbfacafeffcfecda theta is exponential the theta decay on your option accelerates over time look at that last little sliver of the chart see how sharp it goes down thats fd range thats when all the value of the option evaporates nearly instantly like your wifes interest in you when she met her boyfriend ampxb httpswwwoptiontradingtipscomgreeksthetahtmlhttpspreviewredditbrwnmcwmpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsecaabeeeefeedbdef theta will eat your lunch last week i had a c fd on gme that i had to close on a loss even though it was itm why because the rate of decay on the option was so fast that gme wasnt rising fast enough to increase the value of the option and make up the difference buying otm and going itm is good but its important to understand that even if you are itm it still wont save you from theta and sometimes its smarter to take profit rather than waiting you could even take the profit and buy the underlying retardape edition incase youre somehow still here you live in loserville and want to move to tendietown the distance is miles you have work week to get there days so first thing you realize is that you can travel miles per day and youll get there on time great say you take monday off suddenly you need to travel miles per day not impossible but okay thats not a fun speed to move at take note its a increase lets say again on the second day theres no movement now you need to cover the same miles in days okay now youre looking at miles thats a increase from the previous day holy shit now you need to fucking move and move fast but lets say for one reason or another you gary michael edward cant get out of bed on wednesday still have miles to travel now you need to cover that distance in days with an average velocity toward your goal at miles per day thats a increase from the previous day and on the last day you need to do all which is a increase from the previous day this is a gross over simplification but it at least gets point across do you guys get it now every day without progress makes the goal much more unlikely because the burden just shifts and grows exponentially to the remainder of time as the likelihood of the open hitting itm increases and time passes theta acts as a decaying agent on the price bringing it into balance please stop reading option tutorials from plumbers dog walkers high school teachers please read about these concepts on actual investing websites and not the worlds instagram of trading addiction or watch video from actual professional investors if someone tells you theyre not a pro are retarded think twice about letting them explain shit to you read a book motherfucker fds made this

markets including health amp wellness clean beauty and flavor amp fragrance within health amp wellness $amrs focuses on alternative sweeteners vitamins and food ingredients in flavor amp fragrance $amrs produces natural oils and aroma chemicals for a range of applications in clean beauty $amrs focuses on clean skincare and cosmetic ingredients for all you tree huggers their production and products are totally sustainable and by creating otherwise naturally occurring molecules in the lab $amrs saves the destruction of animals and other natural resources as an example they produce a skincare molecule called squalene that otherwise requires killing sharks to get it $amrs generates revenue from a combination of a partnership model and a whollyowned direct model in the partnership model $amrs creates a moleculeingredient in the lab and scales it on a commercial level on behalf of a partner who then uses the moleculeingredient in one of its products which the partner markets and sells to its own customers $amrs captures revenues from producing and selling the moleculeingredient to the partner $amrs receives royalties from the partners product sales that contain the ingredient created by $amrs $amrs has many commercial industrial level partners including firmenich givaudan dsm yifan the us department of energy and darpa on the retail side $amrs has recently announced

tradable float is sold short which amounts to approximately million shares as of with a day average daily trading volume of just million shares and just million shares traded last friday i suspect that when the company delivers on its upcoming transactions this week trading volumes will increase from intense buying a rising share price will put tremendous pressure on short sellers to cover their positions leading to a classic short squeeze and an increased pop in the stock source factsethttpspreviewredditzajakluppngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampseebcdfdedffff upcoming transaction announcements nearterm catalysts beginning last november $amrs began discussing a series of three upcoming strategic transactions that have truly changed the game for the company each transaction is different but effectively involve the monetization of a moleculeingredient whereby a partner pays $amrs a significant upfront cash payment as well as licensing fees royalties over a multiyear period the significance of these transactions cannot be understated as they provide cash to the business while creating recurring revenue streams in effect these deals allow $amrs to selffund its business without diluting existing investors from new equity offerings or extremely expensive debt this is what the market has been craving the first of the three closed last december with a transaction value of just $ millionhttpsinvestorsamyriscomamyrisclosesmillionstrategictransaction and the stock has flying ever since gaining over so far this year the remaining two transactions are set to close within

almost no intuitional coverage and is paid very little attention relative to more established biotechnology companies said differently the institutions that really set valuation and move the stock dont care enough yet to pay attention but they will $amrss investor base only continues to expand as more people wake up to its incredible potential second prior to the recent turnaround the company overpromised a few times just as companies that later mooned like $enph did it happens particularly with early stage companies so even in the efficient market fantasy world the companys public disclosures would have a credibility discount leaving substantial upside for investors today when the company inevitably delivers conclusion these strategic transactions will announce by no later than thursday morning and $amrs will be off to the fucking races for some context the suits at hc wainwright and roth capital partners currently have price targets of $ and $ i like the stock and i think

mk4pod,PAVE,1.67%,an investment that will benefit from the infrastructure bill check out $pave etf,Discussion,30,0.86,ralphsdiorama,40,if you are looking for an infrastructure investment look not further than $pave etf its holdings are well diversified across the physical digital and energy infrastructure found in the bill and options are still very cheap at the moment here is everything you need to know about the etf from seeking alpha the global x us infrastructure development etf pave is in an excellent position to directly benefit from president bidens american jobs plan that was announced on wednesday in pittsburgh pa the proposed plan targets over $ trillion for direct investments into physical infrastructure including transportation schools hospitals and buildings as well as for energy water and digital infrastructure the pave etf holds many of the companies that will provide the materials tools services and components required for this infrastructure buildout and should handsomely benefit from it investment rationale president biden presented the american jobs plan part of his build back better initiative on wednesday in pittsburgh and the white house published a fact sheet on its website in a nutshell a broad summary of the infrastructure initiatives in the american jobs plan is shown below physical infrastructure transportation infrastructure b buildings schools and hospitals b infrastructure resilience b energy water and digital infrastructure cleantech clean energy and related infra b water utilities b digital infrastructure b in total the aggregate spending targeted directly at these infrastructure projects is over $ trillion the investment thesis here is simple find an infrastructure fund that can benefit directly from those investment dollars lets take a look at the pave etf and see what its prospects are going forward top holdings the pave infrastructure development etfs top holdings can be found on global x etf website and equate to roughly of what i would characterize as a moderately concentrated portfolio that holds a total of companies pave has $ billion in assets so even a weight of holding deere de results in a $ million stake many investors would consider deere and odd choice for an infrastructure etf considering it is generally regarded as focused solely on agriculture however de operates in three segments one of which is its construction amp forestry segment this segment manufactures machines for earth moving road building graders excavators material handling crushers and screeners and asphalt pavers de is up over the past year yet has an estimated forward pe of only x the holding with a weight is motion control systems specialist parkerhannifin corp ph which operates a diversified industrial segment that provides sealing shielding vibration and thermal solutions as well as filters noise abatement and contaminate removal systems for water air fuel oil and other liquids ph is also up over the past year has a forward pex and yields the eaton corp etn is the holding and has weight within the portfolio eaton pays a $ annual dividend yields and has a forward pex the company is heavily involved in the power management sector and likely will provide many of the electrical components and assemblies needed to build out the electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure detailed in the american jobs plans investments into clean tech and clean energy the and holdings are railroad companies norfolk southern nsc kansas city southern ksu and csx corp csx along with holding union pacific unp these four holdings alone equate to of the entire portfolio obviously this etf is betting that these rail freight providers will be hauling much of the gravel rock asphalt lumber steel and products and assemblies that will be needed to build out the infrastructure of roads bridges buildings and energy and water systems as detailed in the ajp these railroads will also benefit from opening up and a generally stronger economy some of that has been fueled by the excellent progress the biden administration and bigpharma when it comes to the vaccine rollout and as a result from general expectations that the us economy is opening up fast and will see very strong growth in the h of the year meantime canadian pacific cp recently offered to buy ksu for $ billion which has added some merger mania to the sector surprisingly the fund does not hold caterpillar cat cat is generally thought to be one of the main beneficiaries of an infrastructure bill but considering that stock has doubled over the past year perhaps the management team feels it is overvalued but with a forward pex and a yield cat seems to be an odd omission in my opinion looking through the rest of the portfolio see the full list of holdings here we find many of the companies that sell the raw materials steel aluminum copper lumber asphalt filters etc needed to for as the basic building blocks for transportation electrical utility and water infrastructure performance pave etf wins by a considerable margin over ifra on a nav basis and neither etf pays that much in the way of income and respectively pave is x the size of ifra which has $ million in aum over a shorter timeframe that encompasses the yearofcovid and the period when discussions about an infrastructure bill to get americans back to work with goodpaying jobs got serious pave has also outperformed the ifra etf by a significant margin fund basics these metrics all come from the global x pave etf webpage expense ratio aum $ billion pe ratio x forward pe ratio x pricetobook x day secyield roughly of the fund is invested in the industrials and materials sectors risks considering the strong rally the pave etf has had over the past year in anticipation of the infrastructure bill much has already been built into the price that said note the fund is not overweight any highflying cleanenergy names and despite the growth of some of these stocks many still sell at very reasonable valuation levels see the forward pes of some of the top holding discussed earlier the biggest risk is getting a substantial the american jobs plan through congress it should get through the democratically controlled house in roughly the same shape as presented as we learned with the american rescue plan despite the objections of some of the more progressive members of the democratic party they have shown some level of pragmatism in that they know if the legislation doesnt get through the very narrowly controlled senate it wont matter what they pass in the house much is likely to depend on what senator joe manchin dwest virginia decides he will support as if history is any indication the ajp will get zero republicans votes so the democrats must get all votes so that vice president harris can break the tie i believe the democrats will push the legislation through because a recent poll by navigator recently found broad bipartisan support over for an infrastructure bill by american voters tldr summary amp conclusion for those investors that dont typically invest in the infrastructure sector myself included but want to have some exposure to where their tax dollars are going in the american jobs plan the pave etf seems like an excellent choice the portfolio is full of solidly profitable companies that are reasonably valued and in an excellent position to benefit from the buildout of us infrastructure pave is a buy,2021-04-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mk4pod/an_investment_that_will_benefit_from_the/
mk5h3m,None,N/A,the us govt has a huge incentive to massively underreport inflation,Discussion,171,0.93,Natural_Profession_8,823,tldr the us federal government has a massive incentive to underreport inflation a underreporting of inflation saves the us govt between $ billion and $ trillion per year its likely that such a huge moral hazard has led the government to systematically underreport inflation over the past few decades for background the bureau of labor statistics bls calculates inflation it releases a measure known as the consumer price index or cpi the formula used to calculate cpi is rather complex and opaque and has been changed numerous times over the years the effect of these changes has been to lower the average reported inflation number httpswwwinvestopediacomarticlesconsumerpriceindexasp many government revenues and expenditures are inflationlinked either directly or indirectly directly linked social security payments social security payments are linked to a measure known as cpiw very similar to the cpi httpswwwssagovoactcolacolasummaryhtml every year the amount a social security recipient receives goes up in proportion to the amount of inflation it has been estimated that the social security program has total unfunded liabilities worth $ trillion every of underreported inflation decreases the real value of these unfunded liabilities by $ billion tax brackets tax brackets are adjusted upwards to account for inflation httpswwwinvestopediacomaskanswersaretaxbracketsadjustedinflationasp this means when the government underreports inflation more people move up into higher tax brackets its hard to calculate the exact effect of this on government revenues treasury inflationprotected securities these are treasuries that increase the amount they pay back in both interest and principle according to inflation they are linked to the cpi these securities known as tips compromise of the us federal debt httpswwwtreasurygovresourcecenterfinmktspagestipsaspx this is $ trillion every of underreported inflation decrease the real value of the principle of this debt by $ billion there are also increases to the interest payments on this debt indirectly linked debt interest payments investors will demand higher returns from treasuries in periods where they expect higher inflation the us government has $ trillion in treasury debt the yearly cost of servicing this debt is of that roughly $ billion in if investors were to expect higher inflation this yearly cost would go up by $ billion for every increase in expected inflation there are likely many other government programs that benefit from underreporting inflation these are just the main ones i could find when we add up all these policies we see that underreporting inflation by just can save the government between $ billion and $ trillion a year this is of the entire tax revenue of the us government underreporting inflation by a year would save the government more money than it brings in from taxes every year evidence of underreporting there has probably never been a time in history when such a massive moral hazard existed and was not exploited is there any evidence that the us government has in fact been understating inflation changes to the cpi formula originally the cpi was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods in this case the cpi was a cost of goods index cogi however over time the us congress embraced the view that the cpi should reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living﻿ consequently the cpi has evolved into a cost of living index coli over the years the methodology used to calculate the cpi has undergone numerous revisions according to the bls the changes removed biases that caused the cpi to overstate the inflation rate the new methodology takes into account changes in the quality of goods and substitution substitution the change in purchases by consumers in response to price changes changes the relative weighting of the goods in the basket﻿ the overall result tends to be a lower cpi however critics view the methodological changes and the switch from a cogi to a coli as a purposeful manipulation that allows the us government to report a lower cpi httpswwwinvestopediacomarticlesconsumerpriceindexasp essentially the methodology used to calculate the cpi was changed to purposefully reduce the amount of inflation that is reported when a good is considered to be of increased quality its price increase is lowered to reflect this when the price of one good goes up its relative weighting in the cpi is reduced and another lowerpriced good is substituted for it rent in the average us rent was $ in it was $ httpswwwdeptofnumberscomrentus this is an increase of or an average yearly increase of during the same time the cpi has gone from to httpsfredstlouisfedorgseriescpiaucsl which is only a increase or an average yearly increase of if we use rent as the true measure of inflation cpi has underreported inflation by per year keep in mind that during the period just mentioned the us experienced the most epic collapse in housing prices it had ever seen during the crisis the housing bubble was already far along by httpsfredstlouisfedorgseriescsushpisa nonetheless rent increases managed to outstrip the cpi what do you think is the us government massively underreporting

effort donating $ to two campaign committees formed to back the nov ballot question that would amend the state constitution to allow cannabis to be bought and sold for recreational use gtour viewpoint—cannabis legalization fortysix states have now elected to end prohibition of cannabis and adopt alternative means of regulating its production and distribution within their jurisdiction their ultimate objective is responsible production distribution and consumption of cannabis and combating illegal drug abuse there are now roughly licensed cannabis businesses in the united states people employed in the industry and more than million medical cannabis patients served by the industry we believe the time has come for the united states to create a legal marketplace as other countries have already done given the current political backdrop however we recognize this is unlikely in the nearterm that is why we believe—at a minimum—congress should honor the principles of federalism and states rights by passing legislation that respects the will of voters and state legislatures that have elected to adopt their own approach to authorizing the use of cannabis within their boundaries we also believe the federal government should allow this industry to function like any other business this means statelicensed cannabis businesses should have access to banking and other financial services operate with the same tax structure as other businesses and not be threatened by federal prosecution if they comply with state laws they got what they wanted days ago new

lst66i,None,N/A,“the real moon play” multifaceted infinite squeeze cycle,Discussion,841,0.97,Low-Classroom7736,361,revised i think i get it now its not one or the other squeeze its all of them together driving each other congress just had them testify about round but they dont even know round two is gonna bigger they turned the issue into even more discussed worldwide news that may not be the “catalyst” but it is aerosolized fuel in an enclosed space ready for a spark the armageddon only statistically possible but completely unimaginable scenario were heading towards we all know the shorts exceed the number of available shares and the original short squeeze thesis but now we have the gamma squeeze taking part retail figured out how to counter synthetic shorts by forcing institutions to honor call options every call option that has been written and is in the money must purchase shares in the open market even though there are not enough shares in existence to do that and not just the shares in the market this would mean the entire share count held by hedges and clearing houses being transferred to retail and etf ownership through options being exercised retail countered the naked shorting in way that not only negates it but exponentially increases the squeeze process itll be like using a market order to cover a short squeeze gobbling up any share no matter the costremember the k snipe orders last time except at a market wide level the entire float plus forced shares bought for itm contracts how much can something cost when it doesnt exist but has to be bought the ultimate lesson in supply and demand itll be like taking the strength of pliers and adding a hydraulic press we were all looking at it like round one over extended hedgie shorts vs retail holders forcing a cover but the dynamic has evolved to a multi faceted infinite squeeze cycle this is “the moon” play this makes that ai suggestion of k a share make sense im not saying the ai is right necessarily in terms of price i am saying its gonna take a deeper look at what happens when institutions owe more than they cant deliver and resulting price movement further exacerbates the original step the machine takes information and extrapolates it went to k when it was retail using available shares to force shorts to cover how multiplied can it get when that happens again while institutions are forced to buy share lots for contracts there wont be enough open shares on the market theyll have to sell their own to the option holders just to honor them theyll have to buy more from other brokers and clearing houses having the same problem and all of this is compounded even further because the higher this drives the stock the more option contracts are itm more forced buying and giving their own shares more squeezes more contracts itm repeat repeat repeat repeat thats the important part not just the squeezes the “cycle” because its self perpetuating past a certain point like a dying star reaching the critical mass it takes to become a black hole i saw someone even mention that once and i didnt understand but they were right it would literally crash the stock market and effect all foreign markets involved an upwards crash that sucks all capital from the largest players i see people mentioning “rational thought” or “rational behavior” of the stock but its not rational holding something beyond its suggest value breaks with the notion of rational value systems its mass irrational behavior to cause extreme hyperbolic stock movement i feel like hyperbolic is the right word over parabolic you know how when you buy a call it technically has the potential for unlimited gain because the stock can theoretically go up infinitely this is exactly that situation being played out on a grand scale i think its kind of amazing because this is the defining characteristic of using the the stock market instead of gold it increases the amount of perceived wealth beyond the physical capabilities of the world theres not enough gold or precious metals to equal the world economy its made up to represent something that cant exist but is necessary to facilitate the notion of unlimited growth and now that very same principle may be inadvertently used to either destroy the system or force an evolution of financial theory the entire point of this idea is that the mechanics are being broken by players refusing to acknowledge parameters they learned to cheat the system back at us the first time shorts are creating shorts of shorts they dont exist theyre making unlimited shares to maintain their position so buyers are gonna do the same thing but purposely do it in an arena that cant be expanded indefinitely they can make up the shorts they borrow back and forth with each otherand through unknowing retail stocklending program participants but there are only so many real shares they are inarguably finite by definition could they force a reverse split or force dilution by issuing new shares against shareholders and the companys will i dont know all we have to do is hold hold on to your sense of wonder as the story plays out hold to your courage im not a financial advisor and dont know what im talking about i just like this stock and stories about the end of the world i dont even care about the money that much i just want to take control of my own life i cant wait for us to read about this moment in history someday and each think about what small parts we played and how we remember it apes together

psychology trading appears deceptively easy when a beginner wins he feels brilliant and invincible then he takes wild risks and loses everything trading is a fascinating intellectual pursuit chess poker and a crossword rolled all into one a trader keeps odd hours and puts his capital at risk many traders are loners who abandon the certainty of the present and take a leap into the unknown the goal of a good trader is not to make money his goal is to trade well if he trades right money follows successful traders keep honing their skill if you become half a percent smarter each year youll be a genius by the time you die focus on trading right and improving your skills so that money no longer influences your emotions the trouble with winning is that many people self destruct soon after accidentprone drivers keep destroying their cars and selfdestructive traders keep destroying their accounts traders who are not at peace with themselves often try to fulfill their contradictory wishes in the market if you do not know where you are going you will wind up somewhere you never want to be a successful trader is a realist he knows his abilities and limitations he sees what is happening in the markets and knows how to react to them analyzes the markets without cutting corners observe your own reactions and make realistic plans once an amateur takes a few hits and gets a few margin calls he becomes fearful instead of cocky losers buy sell or miss trades thanks to their fantastic ideas or fears they act like children who are afraid to look under their bed our fantasies influence our behavior even if we are not consciously aware of them a successful trader must identify his fantasies and get rid of them “i lost because i didnt know trading secrets “those ladder attacks” many losers have a fantasy that successful traders have some secret knowledge this is called the brain myth losers do not know that trading is intellectually fairly simple it is less demanding than taking out an appendix building a bridge or trying a case in court good traders are often shrewd but few of them are intellectual often after the amateur is sold out the market reverses and moves in the direction he expected losers take this reversal as a confirmation of their methods they earn save or borrow enough money to open another small account the story repeats the loser gets wiped out the markets reverse a loser is not undercapitalized his mind is underdeveloped he overtrades and his money management is sloppy he takes risks that are too big whatever the size of his account a trader who wants to survive and prosper must control his losses you do that that by risking only a tiny fraction of your equity on any single trade give yourself several years to learn how to trade do not start with an account bigger than $ and do not lose more than percent of your equity on any single trade learn from cheap mistakes in a small account amateurs neither expect to lose nor are in any way prepared for it the notion of being undercapitalized is a copout that helps them avoid two painful truths their lack of trading discipline and their lack of a realistic money management plan most human activities call for an exercise of judgment machines and systems can help but not replace humans just look at accountants airlines pay high salaries to pilots despite having autopilots they do it because humans can handle unforeseen events traders who have the autopilot fantasy try to repeat what they felt as infants their mothers used to fulfill their needs for food warmth and comfort most

lsx9cz,None,N/A,using the macd to possibly forecast the upcoming days,DD,83,0.9,Rage1073,60,hey everyone i went ahead and mapped out the open and close of the market during the last squeeze as well as included charts to that may help us in forecasting what may happen in the following days i wanted to compare that event to the current one to perhaps extrapolate some patterns behind the charts i found some interesting things while doing so and i though i would share all of this is routine for a lot of people who read charts but for those that arent so great at doing so i figured this would help maybe others can extrapolate some bonus data down below is a chart that shows how volatile the days were leading up to the shut down by rh we can also see that the further the pull back was the higher the recovery was when it rebounded back up for example the downtrend between and pre market led to the price going to on the pre of the th something that would have shot up like a rocket if it werent for the halts by brokers ampxb daydateopen macdclose macdah openpm close wed thursday friday monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday ampxb i didnt include what happened on friday because it was shut down and not allowed to properly run its course so those numbers are irrelevant if you notice you see that some days blasted off while others dipped we quickly forgot how much of a roller coaster it was so this should ease your mind dips are normal even near the peak of the event yes dips will happen and they are normal so dont freak out when they occur diamond hand that shit because when they go up they go up big now i took some screenshots that will help us compare some key dates taken at a month view with hour candles first we have this image of ampxb httpspreviewredditxwhsltjjpgwidthampformatpjpgampautowebpampsbafbfaefffead if you notice the macd is about to cross above the signal line now im no expert but these lines help us understand if the market is gonna be bullish or bearish trend you can see the lines dance a bit with one another pulling away and crossing every once in a while but overall they stay in the same range that is until the nd during the premarket we see that the lines cross into bullish territory in a big way you can also note that they had a good pull back after the first day of the squeeze which is currently where we found ourselves yesterday so this is a good thing pull backs are healthy and as we can see above its what we want to see we can compare this to the days leading up to today if you look at the chart below you can see that the lines dance with one another we have pretty much traded sideways just like the chart above until the last couple days when we crossed over and under we can use this to identify and compare the beginning of this squeeze or rather map it out to the last one and possibly give a rough forecast of what may happen in the upcoming days ampxb httpspreviewredditkqxeihybltjjpgwidthampformatpjpgampautowebpampsfddcffcbbacabfc as you can see the macd just flew past the signal line indicating that we are in bullish territory before crossing again and bringing down the price now one thing that sticks out out to me is the size of the gap between lines on it looks almost double in size to the last cross and rise in price another thing to note is the fact that the last immense rise took a couple days while this one rose in less than a day which explains the size of the macd gap as you can see below the macd would make shorter bursts up and down as the days kept going consolidating into an explosion we saw in the premarket of the th when rh and other brokers all restricted buys dont forget that rh wasnt the only one to do it ampxb httpspreviewredditifpkpltjjpgwidthampformatpjpgampautowebpampseeabcdbdfeaafdaca so imo remember im not a financial advisor so take everything here with a grain of salt i think we can get a rough forecast of what we can expect in the coming days by looking at the charts above and comparing the macd crosses in the last days to whats happening now remember not to panic and remember that this wont be a one day event it will most likely play out through several days what or when we will hit the zenith who knows because we cant see the full data thanks to the brokers who backed up the hfs but we can see that even through pull backs were set up for a nice rise there is a lot of pent up pressure that the hfs are trying to cover up eventually all that pressure will have to escape and run its course and as long as we hold and keep it up we will win the bigger and longer the pullback the higher we go again all of this is just conjecture and my humble opinion not financial advice ampxb edit forgot to include my thoughts lol but i think we will have a slow beginning with a healthy rise near the end of the day hopefully it ends up going that route to quote uevlgenus from a broader perspective using the daily chart our first macd cross was under bucks this time we are converging around bucks now let that sink in its gonna get fun yes its x

lsy6uc,None,N/A,dd about sha schaeffler a german industrial and car supplier,DD,14,0.66,gabbathrow,35,fellow investors autists and retards this is my very first dd and actually this is not about getting quick tendies and much more about a midterm or even longterm value play so if you do not want that please skip this post and go back to focus on gme otherwise keep on reading please note this is an old throwaway account of mine because i do not want any relation to be made between my person and this dd so this dd is about the german supplier company schaeffler sha be aware of some currency switching between € and $ as well as a wall of text key facts about the company this is their website httpswwwschaefflercomcontentschaefflercomenindexjsphttpswwwschaefflercomcontentschaefflercomenindexjsp they employ roughly employees worldwide generated billion € in sales in billion $ net revenue of million € in million $ million € in which decreased because of the carcrisis precorona growth in sales and in revenue outperformed all supplier competitors and automotive manufacturers in the past years as of today they have billion market cap million shares publicly traded for figures see below what is the business model schaeffler is one of the biggest automotive and industrial suppliers worldwide it is a german company with solid financials read more below their focus relies on high quality and precision components and systems in the automotive and industrial sphere now what does this mean is automotive not industrial let me explain that schaeffler has three divisions automotive which is supplying almost all automotive manufacturers in the world even tesla industrial which is supplying stuff for machine tools industry and iot solutions of mechanical form and renewable energy generation they are inside almost every windmill in the world afaik automotive aftermarket which is essentially the division that is supplying all the car workshops with spare parts for cars you can see they are setup in a broad way i have more information on the individual divisions down below now those divisions rely on the same knowledge and manufacturing lines more or less which generates lots of synergies in the company and creates additional value instead of just catering to all industries at all costs about the family shareholders and the stock schaeffler is more or less a family company which is listed at all major stock exchanges a couple of years ago they had their ipo with a listing of € $ i think that was in they then rocketed pretty quickly to € currently only million shares of its shares are free float and publicly traded their traded shares also have no voting rights but have a nice dividend to them of the net revenue the other of shares have a voting right but are all owned by the family schaeffler by a holding company the family schaeffler the holding company also owns of continental another supplier company that is almost triple the size of schaeffler and currently has a market cap of billion € there is quite a lot as to why this is the case but in my opinion that is not really as important for this dd long story short in schaeffler tried to buy and swallow continental then the financial crisis hit and they had to take on lots of debt automotive technologies division with automotive schaeffler is generating the largest part of its turnover and revenue i do not have to add that this is also hurting them right now because it is obvious however when auto is back to business schaeffler always outpaced its competitors and even the oems with its growth and revenue share schaeffler has parts in almost every car in the world in the automotive division schaeffler is manufacturing and developing all sorts of stuff for vehicles this obviously includes combustion technology boring exciting is what new stuff they have on the shelves first of all that is a technology for autonomous cars and they are currently the only company that has the permit to use this technology on the road in a lot of countries already right now google space drive next is technology for electric cars they acquired a smaller company that is known for its extremely efficient electric motors their wiring technology and know how is superior it seems like every other month schaeffler is acquiring new orders for its electric motors whether it be in pure electric cars hybrid cars or heavy duty vehicles they are also on the forefront of developments for the usage of hydrogen in cars and other applications also industrial besides the obvious business with european oems they are in quite large business with us and chinese oems chinese business growing the fastest according to their recent releases industrial division the industrial division is where they are manufacturing stuff for typical industrial applications like bearings for wind mills they are inside almost every wind mill worldwide afaik or machine tool stations here they are also working on developing smart bearings that know when their life span has ended this is crucial in large scale manufacturing lines where a bearing failure can result in multiple million $ of damages schaefflers solution for that is essentially marketed under the brand optime condition monitoring obviously incorporating all sorts of industry applications as well as internet of things by the way schaeffler is also active in aerospace where they are actively helping to reduce the co emssions of planes i could see them maybe work with drones in the future and rumor has it they even work on adapting the emobility motor technology for the aerospace industry they are also inside many space applications such as space rockets and the rovers automotive aftermarket division aftermarket is where schaeffler is selling stuff and spare parts and repair kits to automotive workshops to fix cars essentially honestly i have no idea about the division and they make up for the smallest part fo the turnoverrevenue what is cool here is that afaik they can sell their stuff to all workshops and it can then be put into cars where applicable that were not even equipped with schaeffler parts originally which would mean that is quite a huge market the margins also seem to be quite good current financial numbers and costefficiency measures now that we all have a very rough understanding of what schaeffler is about and what they are doing let us talk a little bit about risks current financial numbers and what schaeffler is doing to increase their flexibility and financial basis initially schaeffler lowered their expected results for in january they then published an adhoc release saying that they unexpectedly outperformed their planning and can close the past year better than expected see here httpswwwschaefflercomcontentschaefflercomeninvestorrelationseventspublicationsadhocreleasesadhocreleasesdetailjspnewsidhttpswwwschaefflercomcontentschaefflercomeninvestorrelationseventspublicationsadhocreleasesadhocreleasesdetailjspnewsid from my point of view they will end up with less turnover compared to which would be billion € billion € and a margin of which is incredibly good for the current times if you are asking me might be that i read the release wrong lol how did they achieve those results let us talk about costefficiency measures they have initiated even before the automotive crisis started long before corona obviously i am not too fond here and we can only learn about this from their own publications they are laying off people closing plants that are no longer as profitable as before they are moving manufacturing to lower cost countries and they are digitalizing and optimizing all their processes according to schaeffler their initiatives are working and their preliminary figures underlign this risks well obviously if the car market or industry market keeps crashing and does not recover then this will plummet again the floor around € held quite good though and we had a run up to € the last days the thing is this company is heavily investing in new technologies now and tries to reinvent itself they recently announced an investment in a new central laboratory for rampd if emobility doesnt get big well then schaeffler is excellent in combustion tech if emobility kicks in which is what we all expect arent we then schaeffler has all the right equipment knowledge and tools at hand they even already get lots of orders for emobility stuff check their press releases from the past months in my opinion this is pretty failsafe another risk is that schaeffler got approval to issue new shares in the coming years if the need arises approval was given in the last shareholders meeting in obviously the only one allowed to vote is the family shareholder so this is an obvious risk in the next years stock price compared to other supplier and automotive stocks so yes as written beforehand the company is getting some flack for the boring combustion engine technology for having lots of employees and so on but how does their performance compare to other companies we can compare that with continental timken a much smaller us supplier and some automotive oems like vw gm and the like comparing their stocks charts reveals something super interesting all of the above pretty much all car manufacturers as well as suppliers started plummeting in because of a lack of car sales and then started a slow recovery until covid hit in march today most automotive oems are almost back to levels talking about suppliers the situation is a little worse but almost all of them are dealing with their stock being traded below precovid levels however schaeffler is at a much higher discount now if you factor in the performance of schaeffler in and the preliminary figures from above paragraph you notice that a more or less fair value of the stock would be something around € while it is sitting at € at this very moment so from my point of view there already is an upside of in the short term once people realize this is trading at a discount not even factoring in what they are doing in terms of future growth with emobility and industry stuff in the mid term what else is going on from here on this is more speculation than dd but nevertheless i wanted to mention it so last but not least there is something interesting going on lately besides the typical insider buying of shares which happens on a regular basis from almost all executives especially the ceo the family shareholder mrschaeffler recently gave all of his shares in schaeffler so of the company as well as all continental shares so of conti in pawn i dont know the exact english wording for that for a bank credit line essentially the shares serve as a security for the credit line now how much is that in terms of money more than billion € almost billion $ at the time this took place at the beginning of february so billion $ in securities plus his other securities privately owned stuff would result in a credit that is atleast billion $ from my point of view now why would you need that if you still have a positive cashflow even during corona and an auto crisis this is indeed a very good question so to answer this question i first had to research why anyone would have to put that many securities in the bank for a credit line and why would anyone use shares as a security the result is in out of cases this is typical behaviour for a loan that will be used to purchase and swallow another company i then researched which other companiescompetitors could be relevant and are in the ballpark of billion $ honestly i couldnt find any but then i remembered that continental will bring its entire drivetrain division conventional combustion engine tech plus all the emobility stuff and electronics and mechatronics to the stock market with a spin off and coincidentally this part of continental is worth something around billion € billion $ according to wikipedia you can google continental vitesco spin off however schaeffler already owns of continental and as such also of the supposed spin off company nevertheless this was the most reasonable thing they could do with such a huge loan in my opinion the schaeffler ceo always refuses this option and typically answers questions in that regard with agility is more important than pure size in his latest interview with a german financial newspaper couple days ago he said this again and also said they are more looking into acquiring something in the industrial sphere and not automotive also they would favor smaller acquisitions rather than bigger ones so take all that with a grain of salt target price nope you are not going to get this from me as i am not educated enough for it on march they are going to release the full year results as discussed in the earlier paragraph the numbers are basically already published and are above expectations depending on the capital increase with new shares andor the purchasing of another company i can not predict any prices for this stock however i am on there with shares at € yes pretty sad i know lol but looking to average down personally i expect a potential increase in the shares price of in the midterm range tldr schaeffler is a solid german supplier with solid financials and a good business model compared to its results it is highly undervalued especially considering its current measures for cost efficiency as well as lots of orders for electric mobility projects from major automotive manufacturers in the billions for the next years fuck me because i jumped in around €share but it is a long term hold for me ampxb no financial advice i like the stock,2021-02-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsy6uc/dd_about_sha015_schaeffler_a_german_industrial/
lszghw,OSK,21.78%,osk vs wkhs lets talk about the madness,DD,21,0.73,kissin_frogs,107,this is a discussion for the people who were following the usps contract drama everything that i am posting here is partial speculation i am more than happy for you to shit on my post or downvote me to oblivion i would just like to kindly ask you to post your positions full disclosure i still have calls i have put tldrs in the beginning and after each key paragraph because i know you are all lazy cunts tldr wkhs was on the brink of going bk so there was massive manipulation in the market to make sure the suits would lose less money osk was thrown as bait causing its price increase from the usps contract to fall straight back down the reason is that osk is a sustainable company with great financials and can withstand it disclaimer i am not a financial advisor of any sort this is my opinion and it should not be taken as the word of god full disclosure i am also fucking retarded and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself this is also based on my theories and speculation as some of you may know osk oshkosh was awarded the usps contract for the new fleet of vehicles it was a contract for $m to finalize production for nextgeneration vehicles the total contract can be worth up to $b to supply to over years once the news broke out osk went from ≈$ to ≈$ high this is about a increase in the companys value which is ≈ b in market cap value with osks ttm revenue of b it gave them a multiple of revenue of ≈x the ttm ebitda $m which calculates ≈ times multiple these multiples do not account for the projected revenue and ebitda with the new usps contract the industry average on ebitda multiples is around times for manufacturing companies the average multiple for auto amp trucking is times according to nyu stearnshttppagessternnyueduadamodarnewhomepagedatafilevebitdahtml without the projections of ebitda gains from the usps contract it is already significantly undervalued based on enterprise value ebitda tldr even if osk was at the alltime high of $ per share it was still undervalued by approximately times using ttm numbers no projections and based on usps gains this is based on the auto and trucking industry standards for public companies in other words it didnt matter if osk got the usps contract or not it was still way undervalued i am screaming at the top of my lungs that osk is undervalued so you are probably wondering why osk fell like a ton of bricks back to $ when the news about one house democrat cried foul play on the usps deal whatever i am going to say now is partially theory pulled based on available information online i would love for anyone to call me out if i may be wrong but post your positions also this is where workhorse plays a significant role in the movement of osk stock as some of you might have noticed wkhss value dropped by nearly after it was announced that osk was awarded the contract rather than wkhs some may agree and some might disagree but wkhs was banking on the contract to essentially survive in other words it was a hail mary that would have saved them from all their struggles i will not go into enterprise value and ebitda ratios with wkhs or any of that because they only have a ttm revenue of ≈k you read right k not m it would just be a waste of my time this is really scary because wkhs has a lot of debt on its books as of wkhs had a net debt of $m additionally wkhs raised an additional mhttpswwwfreightwavescomnewsworkhorsegetsmilliontoadvanceelectricvanproduction this adds up to around m in debt assuming they did not pay any off from there was no way for wkhs to service that debt without bringing in new revenue if they cannot service the debt based on historical numbers how are they going to service the new debt the creditors approved debt as they were betting on wkhs getting the usps contract wkhs either had some excellent investment bankers or the underwriters need to be fired because this was pure speculation which is a big bet for debt financing when the news came out two days ago that osk was awarded the contract wkhs went tits up even though the terms on the loans did not require wkhs to repay debt until creditors felt the pressure as wkhs lost the contract additionally the companys value decreased by half leading to any debt convertible to stocks being less valuable if creditors do not feel that a company is capable of servicing a debt they can recall the loan anytime correct me if i am wrong this probably was going to happen they were flirting with insolvencyhttpsfinanceyahoocomnewsworkhorsesharecollapseraisespressurehtml and all their investors would have lost their investment the largest investor before all this drama was not ark it was your big institutions and mutual funds ie blackrock inc vanguard group inc the and seaport global asset management llchttpsfinanceyahoocomquotewkhsholderspwkhs and they would have lost a lot of money tldr paragraph wkhs was close to being insolvent if creditors decided to pull the plug they had all the reason to with wkhs losing the race for the usps contract disclaimer this is speculation and theories what does this have to do with osk going down they both have the same largest institutional investors backing the stock blackrock and vanguardhttpscafinanceyahoocomquoteoskholdersposk within a day after the news blackrock would have lost ≈$m in value and vanguard would have lost ≈$m assuming they did not sell any shares after they both would have made only ≈m from the osk stock price jump this leaves them with the choice of the small gain from osk or large losses from wkhs if these institutions let wkhs sink they would have lost all their investment which was approximately an additional $m for blackrock and $m for vanguard these are just calculations for of the institutional investors institutions would have to bear a larger cost letting wkhs go bk without some gains rather than allowing osk to jump up from the news the creditors also would have lost a lot of money if this were to happen as there will be unserviced debt and a loss in value in the convertible stocks even if osk went down the suits would not have lost much money because osk can sustain itself without the usps contract with osks management osk has grown year over year this is not just enterprise value they increased revenue and ebit every year before the covid since the ceo has been in place tldr paragraph big money and creditors would have lost big by letting wkhs go bk it is okay for osk to fall in the short term because it is undervalued and they proved they could grow year over year this is where a lot of manipulation might be happening behind the scenes there was a bunch of shorting and options activity during this time this was probably institutional investors hedging their bets to make up for losses for example ark bought multiple dips on wkhs as the stock plummeted from the news they nearly doubled their position by the timing of god himself news came out merely hours claiming house dem will push back hard on usps decision to choose osk this is apparently one house democrat crying foul play not the whole house where the title tries to mislead you into thinking since osk was linked to the usps contract it fell with regards to the news in my opinion way too much as i believe it is extremely undervalued there might also be additional selling to exacerbate the wkhs dump as i finish writing this wkhs was a clear buy then sell scheme with news that was overexaggerated and probably paid for to minimize huge losses that would have come with wkhs insolvency the people who would bear the pain are people who believed that wkhs is a good company i have seen people comparing wkhs to nikola stating how it was undervalued compared to each other what they dont understand is that they were comparing garbage to garbage with this belief that wood can do no wrong a bunch of people jumped over the cliff tldr paragraph osk had to take the fall for wkhs while the markets were manipulated to prop up wkhs so the suits would not have to take as big of a loss the pain will be transferred to the retail investors as a sea of retailer investors followed cathie wood into buying the dip positions osk $ call ely sbux t

lt2kv4,None,N/A,why equities are just in the beginning of the bull run long post,DD,208,0.93,nafizzaki,88,tldr this post will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now premise equities are selling off due to rising treasury yieldhttpswwwtreasurygovresourcecenterdatachartcenterinterestratespagestextviewaspxdatayield the reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex but let me try to explain nonetheless people are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff now yields being that low it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and more appetite for risk assetshttpswwwreuterscomarticleususabondsmarketsiduskbnqnr plus bonds were already at a price where yields couldnt have gone any lowermeaning existing bond prices couldnt have gone any higher thus this lower demand lead to a rise in yields this created a feedback loop due to mortgagebacked bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher they do it due to convexity hedging if you have no idea about what i said read this one uphttpswwwbloombergquintcomonwebconvexityhedginghauntsmarketsalreadyreelingfrombondrout this has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield overall this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the fed continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy thus the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher jpow and yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time specifically until we reach full employment thus they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is these are based on their publicly stated statements which means it may mean something now consider the scenario real interest rate will remain negative the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario while we know that long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously over the last yearsarticle data till april httpswwwnytimescombusinessbondsbeatstocksoveryearshtml with long treasury bonds having an annualised return of while sampp having only that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks the same picture emerges for the last years since dataset ourdatedhttpswwwbloombergcomnewsarticleslongdatedtreasuriescrushspperformanceoverfiveyears this whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century and as yield continued to fall the bonds rose in price as is customary now as the yield slightly rises it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price this also attracts more bond investors as a result i suspect that yields will not rise too much plus it is a very crowded trade as a result of bond having this superb riskadjusted return stocks saw huge outflows according to cathie wood stocks saw $b in outflowsexcluding repurchases since and bonds saw $t in inflowshttpswwwmarketwatchcomstorystocksarentinabubblebuthereswhatisaccordingtofundmanagerarkinvestscathiewood so if there is actually any bubble it is in the bond market think about it for a second sure bonds provided absolutely superior riskadjusted return compared to stocks but because of this everyone and their mother are in bonds stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets now bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market in this scenario we wont be seeing any negative rates while continuing to experience negative real interest rate being a bond investor would be painful if you are a bond investor already you want the yield to go lower potentially negative but that is not happening either if yields rise you are losing money if you are a prospective bond investor you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on liquidity is present in the market bonds arent that attractive stocks are a good bet in this scenario especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we dont go weimar republic style after all you are duddenly not going to stop buying from amzn stop using msft products or pltr products just because inflation is here question is which stocks i think boomer stocks are your best friendlook for the things brk buys and after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldnt be a bad idea eitheri think us dollar has been declining after march it is overall good for the stock market and the global economy in general for one it makes it easier for foreigners to buy us stocks and two it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets one could say em stocks are a potential good source for riskadjusted return and i also think the same although short usd have had been a popular crowded and winning strategy for the last year one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the usd higher however in the long run i suppose em stocks would also be a good area to look out for especially india seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation and not specifically supply crunch some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage which would be bad for the market but i disagree we have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy stagnating wages high unemployment technological innovations cheap labour based production in foreign countries demographic challenges etc some supply crunch is definitely there but to say that production wont normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind some of you may not know that cpi does include rents healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us so before you comment that the government is manipulating cpi to make inflation numbers low i would suggest you to read how and what are the weights of each consumption factorshttpswwwblsgovcpitablesrelativeimportancehomehtm also stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesnt really counter the loss of employment income our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts it is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt thus our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low while also allowing inflation to rise you may think how can this be a free market if basically this is capitalism with usa characteristics add to that direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is well the various companies conclusion using my crystal ball which cost me $ to buy i can say this this is what i can say from all the points that i have mentioned risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds usd is accommodative for the stock market global economic recovery especially in em economies will be good thus helping our companies deficit financing inflation will be good for most stocks liquidity is present bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops no deflation there is likely going to be real inflow into stocks stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds thus i think while we will have lower overall rate of return in this decade i think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while current panic in the market is nonsensical to me disclaimer this is not financial advice i eat crayons and stuff this is a casino dont listen to retards on the internet please dont i also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes risk of my predictions being completely off the mark fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheatingother events and starts quantitative tightening we do have a huge supply crunch in every sector

lt47yg,A,5.01%,a slap back to reality,DD,102,0.62,Billybobbjoebob,322,obligatory this is not financial advice i am not a cat financial advisor ampxb i believe in a time like this a lot of people need a fresh glass of some ice cold water splashed right into their faces ampxb tldr ape explanation i want gme to moon but i am concerned about people being fed false information the claim melvin said they didnt close their short position at the hearing is a lie their opening statement specifically had them saying they did close it the strategy of itm calls boosting the price was tested last time amp failed last time these are covered calls there isnt enough of a short interest to force the price up by holding the profit comes when hf close positions but you wont know that happened until its over ampxb i would love to see gme rocket to the moon and i believe there is a scenario where that can be possible but i want to go over the popular scenarios that will deceive you into believing they are the scenarios that will lead you to the moon this is not a bear post against gme this is reality this is for those of you newcomers who thought you missed out on the last gme wave this is for those of you who were stuck holding the bag last time me included and are looking at profiting from this time to make that money back this is for those of you who just didnt learn your lesson and need a reminder of what went down last time ampxb as i said there are scenarios where gme can be squeezed but what scenario is that and what scenarios are not that ampxb first thing first i want to stop a lie that i have seen spread like wildfire the blatant lie that melvin capital during the gamestop hearing admitted to not closing out their short position on gamestop this is not true now i am going to assume whoever came up with this lie did it as a valiant effort to help boost the price of gamestop and probably hoped no one would call them out on their bs because nobody else decided to waste their time watching a hour congressional hearing about stocks those are about the two most boring things in the world combined but you dont even have to get that far into the hearing to call this lie out for the bs that it is in melvin capitals opening statement within the first minute of it they state they closed out of their short positions in gme days before any restrictions were put on it you can look up videos of the opening statements yourself i wont baby you that much so in conclusion dont rely on the scenario that melvin never closed out their short positions its a lie and it needs some water doused on it ampxb scenario two possibly the most believed strategy on gme thursdayfriday keeping the price over insert dollar amount here by friday close makes insert number here of calls itm and when they cover the price is going to rocket now i am not going to say this scenario is impossible but it is not very likely and it is what got many people burned the last time yes it is true keeping the price over a certain price making a lot of calls itm can be good for the stock if those calls arent covered calls which i believe that almost all of them are the week ending jan nd there are probably a lot of naked calls that hurt the sellers bad when gme closed at a very high price nobody expected it that helped it a lot the following week when we saw the big spike but then lets run down what happened that following week yes rh restricted buying on thursday th which i do believe stopped the biggest of the squeezed but it would not have played a role in the ineffectiveness of the calls itm strategy that followed that thursday the price plummeted into the $s that friday you heard a lot of chatter of as long as we can get the stock up to $ a lot of calls will be itm and we will be golden my fellow apes get it to $ and thats bonus points that will be k calls that will be itm and have to cover thats million shares and yeah a lot of that was true there were k calls that would be itm if we closed above $ and you know what we did we closed above $ we closed around $ in fact this was it come monday that price was going to the moon k isnt a meme we chanted we couldnt be wrong we did the maths we had the dd diamonds dont crack baby well come monday there was no lift off it was the space shuttle columbia all over again the stock fell and it fell hard going back into the low $s dipping into the $s even before closing in the $s thats okay though thats fine they had until wednesday to actually close on those calls youd hear so tuesday came and went then wednesday too we never saw $ again in fact by friday we were barely even seeing $ so what happened what went wrong we had maths and anime on our side well what i believe happened is those call contract sellers learned their lesson that first week that ended jan nd when they got screwed they didnt let their calls be naked the following week they bought up gme stocks when it was low at the beginning of that week if they didnt already have them this allowed them to resell those stocks at $ and under making them the big winners in all of this but that meant these werent new stocks that would help us go higher no these were stocks bought on the way up they helped us peak but wouldnt help us go over the peak so when those calls executed there were suddenly a lot of new holders of gme stock holders who saw their stocks were worth $$ these werent diamond handers like you or i these apes wanted their bananas now so they sold when they got them gotta cash in those profits at some point as wsb loves saying you cant lose if you dont sell well you also cant win if you dont sell so now flash forward a month later and the same theory is being pushed keep the price over $ and we will rocket to $ come monday no scratch that $ no wait even better $ you hear in the echo chamber bouncing off the walls like gme does in the first minutes of market open thats not going to happen these are covered calls that are itm youre not forcing anyone to buy new stocks at the current price you are just buying stocks for $$ that were already bought at $$ and are keeping the stock price stagnant and none of this is even mentioning that the amount of itm calls this time is like a third of what it was last time so do not rely on this strategy ampxb scenario three they have to cover then we can set our own price this is probably the most ignorant reason and is why i typed it out like that yeah im mocking you get over it it is true they do have to cover eventually but not with your stocks gme short interest is somewhere around too lazy to relook up the actual number and this is after new reports showed million more shares were shorted on wednesday now yes that is a high amount of short interest but that isnt high enough for the diamond hands approach theres still ish percent of shares out there not shorted and yes diamond handers hold a lot of those most are going to be held by institutions and those institutions are about the money not the message they see a x profit they sell they sell to whoever is willing to buy could be more diamond handers could be hedge funds but eventually apes are going to run out of money to buy and hold with thats when the hedge funds can swoop in buy up these stocks cover their short positions the people they borrowed from might not be diamond handers and end up selling to more hedge funds when the short interest is only around you cant win with the buyhold strategy when the short interest is the short squeeze happens and you dont know it happens until it is over and the hedge funds have covered you win by riding the wave up as hedge funds cover and then you get out near the top thats the end of your ride the ride doesnt just keep going up you can only set the price when you own most of the market and in this case we dont and on top of all of that you also have people who are doing this with their bill money the st of the month is coming up thats a lot of rent needing paid no shame in needing to sell so you can pay your bills but thats more shares that will flood the market probably a fraction of the actual amount of shares out there but pennies add up to dollars eventually ampxb and those are the three scenarios in which you have a higher chance of losing than winning again i cannot stress this enough i do believe a short squeeze can happen with gme but i do not believe it is any of these three scenarios that will make it happen im just tired of seeing people being fed these these delusional optimistic claims that throw truth history and real dd amp common sense out the window treating gme more like a pnd than an actual short squeeze its okay to drink the koolaid but maybe check to make sure it isnt spiked first ampxb edit ive been

response but its getting a bit tiring and i have other things to do so i will not be replying to any further comments i might keep going with the fun conversations but for the rest i will not

lt7miq,DON,4.71%,dont sell at a loss some advice on fundamentals for new traders,DD,5697,0.94,Dumputer,1145,💎🙌🦍here i wrote some basic advice ill repost here for any newbies who want to get in on the action or anyone who bought high and is for whatever dumb reason thinking about paperhanding paperhanding is fundamentally bad investment practice especially if youre a new investor ill explain why dislaimer ive only been trading for a few years and i only know this shit because i have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff and he hasnt steered me wrong yet so take it for what its worth but based on all the fact that paperhanding is even an issue here you apes clearly need this advice edit these are fundamentals to the way i trade but obviously everyones trading strategy is different note that this is a quantitative approach to investing which doesnt encourage yoloing this is one way to invest which does not require you to outsmart the general public by spotting opportunitiesvalue before the market does i feel its particularly relevant to the gme play the ticker symbol is less important than what you do with it there are other approaches which often require more experience but i feel this is most accessible to new investors gme is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything well everything that you dont think will go bankrupt or get delisted new traders or people who are thinking of becoming new traders should read this especially if youre new i think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market this applies to all stock not just gme if youre experienced it might just sound like im explaining at length why but since a friend of a friend told me he paperhanded on gme sold the dip i feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea i would encourage people to buy gme but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while edit in addition just to reiterate keep plenty of money in reserve so you can buy more if the stock goes down by this i mean never sell at a loss simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down all newbie investors imo should adhere to this rule just in general buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground or dont buy it at all many investors myself included follow this rule religiously not just with gme but with all stocks i have never lost money in the stock market because i never sold at a loss i just held or bought more covid crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out i just held and was fine should have bought more if everyone bought into gme with this mindset i bet it would go to pluto easily if you sell at a loss you are donating to the save the short sellers fund out of your own wallet fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes and youre not even following sound investment practice just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy if youre thinking of investing so much that youll wuss out poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red just dont emotion and the stock market do not mix well stop losses below purchase price are also for pansies and genuine idiots “ill sell you some stock but only if you give me a bad enough price on it” your plan should be to buy when the stock goes down if you feel like you need a stop loss youre investing more than you should instead of being stupid maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips side note personally in the case of gme i dont have any limit sells either from what i can tell on past short squeezes the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down so as long as you keep an eye on gme when it actually does skyrocket you should have plenty of time set price alerts and relax no need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket midlaunch although if you want you can try to profit off gme volatility some people are getting shamed for taking profits but im not sure they deserve it as far as i know buying low and selling high doesnt really help hfs it drives the price up just not as much as buying and holding but personally my philosophy is i can take baby profits anytime who knows when something like this gme rise will happen again so im holding shares at cost average $share want to get into the game now you could always just buy a few shares and keep the rest of what youre willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip and buy a little bit more each time it goes down more bringing your cost average down ideally you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero always try to keep cash in reserve locked yourself in at a high price thats why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down didnt keep any cash in reserve guess youre stuck waiting for one of three things the short squeeze which will likely though not certainly happen for the price of gme to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases or you get your hands on some more cash youre willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down do not sell at a loss and you will never lose edit well seldom if ever unless the company goes bankrupt a rare occurrence this is why you dont put all your eggs in one basket and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero it wont swallow your portfolio also if you truly fucked up and used money that you need for health insurance or something you may just have to back at least partially out with your tail between your legs and consider it a lesson hedge funds and billionaires know this thats why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic they bought the dip while regular folks paperhanded and got even poorer one more little trick if you manage to scoop up a nice juicy shares then even if your position goes “underwater” you can always sell calls at above your average cost bring down your cost basis and make money off your stock “risk free” while still following the rule of never sell at a loss although if you did it right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen and youll need to be patient and like i said before say goodbye to your money for a while edit just to reiterate there are many trading strategies and i just feel this is one of the best for newbies trade however you want just dont paper hand gme i would also note that you can sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price it still follows the rule of dont sell at a loss buy one share at $ and sell it at $ doesnt matter if you still have shares in the red from earlier you can even slowly take your cost basis down by doing the thing where you buy a share when it goes down and sell one when it goes up edit yes i know about opportunity cost it does apply if you know something the general public doesnt rare if youre just a low iq ape but gme wasis an exception many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesnt it could be a coin flip whether youll hit rock bottom in an ideal world you can keep some money in reserve so you dont have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities yes i know about and agree with the sunk cost fallacy my point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal lowering the cost basis not “doubling down” on sunk cost tldr 🦍buy 🍌 dont give 🐍 🍌 unless 🐍 give more than 🦍pay for 🍌 not financial advice i am literally a zoo ape that somebody dropped their phone into the

lt89s3,ON,10.50%,nrdrages friday dd the semis play not just the best you can do because of your low t that earned your wife a boyfriend trading chip shortages for top shelf tendies $on $mrvl $nxpi and a special surprise,DD,49,0.91,NrdRage,32,hi all nrdrage here you might remember from such recent hits as buy $pltr ps as its ripping here $clne june cs are literally free money sell your $nclh leaps in the area and buy back later the next day near youre welcome btw as that trade probably saved your week and $nvda june cs are going to make you rich today were gonna talk about the semiconductor chip space fluff content bbbbut nrdrage you called $nvda you already talked about them i really didnt be honest when i say chipssemis the first things you think of are $nvda $amd and $intc those are a wholly different thing than whats on everybodys lips these days in relation to the vaunted shortage dealing in high performance silicon that is being produced at full blast theyre not going to be given a ticket to the feed trough of free taxpayer money supposing somebody informs buyden that by chip shortage theyre not indicating he needs to send his interns to the snack aisle of the grocery store to hoard not a sure thing what were going to be talking about are the lower grade asic application specific chips that are used more in infrastructure these are the commodity level products that are used for things like the computers in vehicles mobile phones wireless towers specialized digital binary money mining and so elon can implant them in chimps for evil genius mind control experiments placeholder chart for expected g tower growth placeholder chart for automotive chip demands and supply bottleneck chart to q your bigger players here are going to be taiwan semi $tsmc lam $lrcx and st $stm of them are boring to trade and lam im not allowed to talk about because of a conflict of interest w my vc lets talk about the government for a minute ok be honest half the reason youre here is because you heard buyden is going to dump loads of free money into these companies so theyll make more chips after all thats what cnbc has told you and they never lie right right thats actually not what has happened in washington and god help us that line about buyden thinking the chip shortage has to do with potatoes was only half joking what the government has done was signed up to spend money studying why theres a chip shortage the concern here is that even the us based semis outsource out their chip production to places like china and vietnam and theres a growing push to incentivize companies to bring production domestically this is especially spurred by $nxpi who is bottlenecking the automotive industry by selling too much overseas now lets be honest its about that all they do is waste money on the study and never actually make the investment because getting things like this done is hard and its much easier to focus on social issues that are already covered by other laws but make it look like something is getting done we have talkers and not doers right now thats just the nature of the beast speaking of lets talk about $nxpi the laggard $nxpi represents the only true foreign company were going to examine today based in the netherlands $mrvl is technically based in bermuda but theyre a us company more on that later at the time of this writing theyre trading in the low s with a market cap of about billion their specialty is in chips that power infotainment systems for cars so when you hear $f whine about how they cant get enough chips theyre lowkey throwing shade at $nxpi the only reason theyre being included in this list is because as a big automotive chipmaker in spite of the whole buy american virtuing from the current government if they spend money to ramp up manufacturing theyre going to hand money to $nxpi to set up factories here and will be dumb enough to not make it contingent upon $nxpi keeping the chips here in the country so theyll continue to sell them to the rest of the world looking under the hood of their money comes from cars another comes from phones comes from infrastructure think wireless towers and about of their money comes from selling chips to amazon and google so their virtual assistants can spy on you and listen to your wifes boyfriend having sex on your dining table with his balls rubbing right against where your plate of hungry man frozen dinners sits when he takes her out on a date she goes out with the girls hey i think one of those peas fell on the table pick it up and put it in your mouth yeah roll it around in there tastes like taint doesnt it theyre b asically a smaller representation of trevors nuts or a life size version of yours you dirty little bitch so one could say theyve got a pretty good product mix and were one of the earlier players in the sector to recover yet still lagged behind them overall unlike the other players were gonna talk about later or you could say that theyre a bunch of flip flopping noncommitters who create a schizophrenic company in some weird attempt to not be cyclical they trade at a lower multiple to their competitors but this is largely due to the fact that theyre leveraged more deeply than the rest the best comparison to these guys would be $txn if you want something else to track it by placeholder i might put a chart here later in an edit that compares price in relation to ebitda placeholder i might put a chart here later in an edit that shows forward earnings estimations based upon the increase in auto and iot chip costs what do they think theyre going to be long term thats the thing its impossible to tell if theyre going to become a big player in cars or iot theyre not compelling in infrastructure because what makes $nxpi interesting here in spite of the fact that everybody is pissed at them for spreading themselves too thin is the fact that theyre such whores with who they sell to that theyve become something of an interesting mampa speculative play as its entirely possible a company just comes along and buys them to bolster their supply chain for chips once and for all in particular there is a strong indication that samsung has been kicking the tires for over a year ok moving $on get it dad joke $on the overachiever $on represents the only true domestic semi on this list so if youre playing the corporate welfare trade youll be interested here if $nxpi is the bpdafflicted ex who loves strongly and thats why she lit your car on fire $on is that superfocused new girlfriend whos dating you because she knows somewhere in your contact list is a local celebrity she can use to get her closer to being the bachelorette after she dumps your ass on is allin on things the vehicle revolution and g theyre positioning themselves as the place to go to if youre making evs or autonomous cars as they are focused on lidar sensory chips and power management why its simple on was is and always will be interested in the highest margin businesses possible cyclical nature of them be damned sure they stick the tip of their johnson in the industrial sector crossselling their sensory chips for purposes of machine vision think automated amazon warehouse part pickers but its not something they spend a lot of time on does this strategy work at least for right now lets look under the hood they had a massive beat last quarter and then upgraded forward guidance by and this stonk has already had quite a run more than to date which has outpaced its competitors by almost double the automotive section of their portfolio rose and represents about of their revenue at this point but its clear to see that if we have this conversation in a year that number will be well over their infrastructure revenue wireless towers lagged but that was due to their vendors and actually represents a forward opportunity they beat in spite of a major part of their portfolio dumping so the answer is yes how simple mind control and cancer technology from the lizard people whos secret society is bustling under the ice of antarctica aka g the telecoms as a result of the virus really slowed down their rollout of g last year it was suspected that might carry through this year as well you may have noticed the news a day or two ago that $t and $vz caught downgrades because of unexpectedly high prices paid in the most recent bandwidth spectrum auctions that changes all of that since everybody had to pay so much more for the spectrum space look for these players to be very aggressive in trying to shorten the roi frame on those expenses by aggressively expanding out their g infrastructure there are companies that this is very good news for $swks another stock i cant comment on because of conflict of interest so do your own dd with them $on and the next participant in this which well get to in a moment so there are about to be a lot more chips from $on in your kids school shooting ovarian cancer rays into that boy you likely wont see this reflected on the balance sheet until their q earnings but since everybody knows its coming its going to get baked into the price which is why youre very likely to see a melt up over the next months the one thing that sets $on apart from the rest of the equities on this list is that theyre not a a minifab that meaning theyre not a company that simply outsources chip production to other people overseas and who has shown a willingness to keep some production in house matter of fact their ceo recently came out and affirmed that he wants to maintain a balance between outsourcing and inhouse which means when its time to get some of that sweet sweet taxpayer money to build out us production theyll have their hands out tldr if youre bullish on evs selfdriving cars and the illuminati youre bullish on $on if youre playing the gubmint corporate cheese play $on $mrvl the duke brothers marvell is functionally a us company santa clara but is technically headquartered in bermuda because theyre filthy tax dodgers if youre one of those ethical investors stay far away from this company because theyre as dirty as they come in a lot of ways they also trade at a lower multiple than the others on the upside if the government starts offering money to build american sell to china they will elbow their way to the front of the line to take the free moneyand then build a person operation somewhere in iowa that makes hard drive chips and pocket the rest which will definitely pad their bottom line one thing thats different with $mrvl here is that they completely outsource their chip production right now so if they were to take government money they would have to build their infrastructure from the ground up and figure out how to make it work anyways lets look under the hood of their revenue comes from the storage sector meaning the lions share of their money is legacy selling chips that go in hard drives on the consumer side its in platter discs their ssd play is in the enterprise space because theyre not high performance chips booooooooooooooooriiiiiiiiing but nrdrage i can hear you saying that means theyre gonna be huge in the cloooooouuuuuuud sure except margins in t he cloud computing space keep shrinking at exponential rates as it becomes more commoditized so its a lot like investing in emc in theyve invested heavily in automotive in the last year but theyre a day late and a billion dollars short there it will take at least years before that investment starts bearing fruit so theyre not an interesting play in that aspect and likely would use that free taxpayer money to try and close their gap there because they werent forward thinking in that regard theyve been active in acquisitions lately most recently buying inphi which serves to just attempt to keep up with $nvda in the arm chip space for data centers for the record they cannot keep up with $nvda in that space so dont think youre paying for a dominant player there its a high profit sector but not exciting and dependent on their continued contract winning in the whitebox space all this sounds like theyre big spenders but thats not really true theyve actually been excessively cautious in leveraging debt which is why theyre so far behind in the auto space as only or of their revenue came from things like industrial or iot mrvl is actively winding down t hose sectors of their business and abandoning t hem what they are thats interesting however is almost exclusively a g play and in that regard they are fucking rock stars g alone represents about a billion dollars per quarter as things get more heated there because theyre not just a domestic g play theyre really well positioned to be the dominant chip maker in both the land of the hentai sun and for the europoors if youre investing in $mrvl this is the sole reason youre doing so and its a compelling case theres no chart data i can provide asyet that can accurately project their positioning in the market in this area but rest assured when that data can be quantified theyre going to be a big time player in it matter of fact just yesterday they announced they were partnering with fujitsu in a g baseband agreement with regards to fujitsus base stations bad day to announce that news since the best performing stonks were the ones that only closed down placeholder chart goes here for g chip earnings and market share placeholder chart goes here for telecom expansion analysis so to summarize the entire sector is very cyclical and presently it represents a perfect storm of an upgrade in telecommunications technology automotive advancements and iot dont bet on them just because you hear buyden is virtue signalling some bullshit about solving fords chip crisis because its probably going to be another example of lifetime politicians being all talk and no action theyre all healthy financially none of them are heavily shorted and pressure is to the upside albeit not in any sort of extreme adrenaline releasing way if you really want to bet on government the real bet here is the stimmy money getting handed out again dc is basically telling everybody to go buy a new phone with the next installment of checks and those phones are going to be g capable and the people are going to want to leverage that dont tell the lizard people i know about their secret base thats all well and good fucker but how do i play them can i fd $nxpi you actually can you can expect daily movement of between with some regularity with a itm delta of about and a gamma approaching and a half spoiler alert all these are going to have garbage gammas just a nature of the industry dont go crazy out of the money but weeklies are absolutely something you can do here $on you cant really this is really more of a melt up play you dont necessarily have to play leaps but weeklies are gonna be a bad idea stay close to in the money and go or months out at a time currently im sitting on cs which i will roll over into june calls as we get closer to expiration you always want to stay a little in front of these dudes itm delta is almost always sub and gamma is often times about short term stay a little ahead of them and it improves dramatically $mrvl theyre ok there but like $on youre probably going to want to stay ahead of them though you can fiddle with this a bit delta is pretty good but the gamma is absolute dogshit if you target something about one direction or another you should be happy as long as you pick the right side of the coin flip outlook and price targets $nxpi im neutral on them bordering on bullish theyre the biggest reason we keep hearing about this silicon crisis right now but theyre being coy about whether the reason theyre not keeping up is because they dont or wont produce enough or if its just because they wont sell enough to us they represent a potential speculative play if somebody who really needs chips for their business decides to just solve the problem by throwing money at it and bringing that development in house month price target $on bullish theyre laser focused and well positioned to take advantage of all the highest margin business in this cycle and as the demand for these products ramps up their outlook is going to exponentially outpace everybody else in the space even the chips i didnt talk about today exempting gaming chip makers in the short term but if you manage to stick your dick in your wife when shes sleeping one night and dribble your downsafflicted swimmers into her you could very well see by the time that chromosome hoarding bundle of joy licks your wifes vag i expect to see this one in triple digits at some point a darling $mrvl bullish for g only once you start seeing the telecoms advertise theyve got nationwide g coverage and research studies to back that up their cycle will be over and theyll go back to legacy revenue but expect big things from them as $t and $vz try to keep up with tmos breakneck pace short term price of $ long termeh whatever positions $nxpi i dont hold a position with them and dont anticipate doing so unless a strong momentum trade forms i think they can move but theyre not interesting to me some of you will like them especially since you can fd them because of the occasional spikes and craters $on $cs and cs i also have shares at i grabbed some weeklies for next week at during yesterdays bloodbath but that was just me feeling cute you cant really shadow trade that since its already back up to $mrvl $cs and shares at nrdrage double feature bonus dd $utz i keep making those buyden hears chip shortage and thinks frito lay is in trouble jokes but the thing is im only half kidding that has nothing to do with this equity other than it got me thinking about my favorite snack brands a week ago i had no idea this company was even publicly traded i always knew them as a family run northeast niche thing one thing i did notice however was a couple of years ago their chips started showing up in grocery stores near my colorado homes which i had been assuming meant they were having things shipped from the east coast and when we spent a couple of weeks at our la home recently so i could get in some motorcycle riding and away from the snow i found them on the shelves out there too somewhere along the way they decided to become a national brand and have started penetrating markets all over the place i have no idea what their financials look like or any other solid dd besides knowing that theyre fucking delicious and if youre a believer in the product then believing in the company shouldnt be hard so i bought a thousand shares at in solidarity with them then i saw cramer hyped them a couple of nights ago and cursed myself for starting to turn into a shitty boomer maybe they become a big player in the snack food space on their own maybe a company like $pep comes along and buys them out regardless if you like the product go out and buy some

enable us to see all the data points at once for all you apes out there all that means is the higher you go the faster you go higher this trend started in august it will likely continue as long as ryan cohen and the folks he brought over do good work now lets address those large spikes ampxb january ape welcoming party no despair herehttpspreviewredditxvxjutrvjpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsedbbcbebaecdbbefa see this its a classic example of a textbook speculation bubble dont panic just breathe and read if youre having trouble go ask your wifes bf to read it out loud for you seehttpspreviewredditsyvptmtvjpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsefccfcbdaffcacafedfe so a speculation bubble occurred but why what caused it and what does that mean going forward especially with the recent activity yesterday and today firstly i am not a financial advisor and i dont give financial advice secondly to answer is pretty simple this was caused by millions of apes rushing to the stock market to buy gme duh news goes viral about the squeeze the apes buy paper hands sell ok but that sounds really bad right again not necessarily bubbles like this happen all the time on all just about anything that can be traded over time scales ranging from a few hours to a few months one of the things that makes gme such unique opportunity is that there is an incredibly tiny number of available shares relative to its market cap this important for the squeze but it also means the price is more susceptible to dramatic price fluctuations in fact it is this property that make a squeeze possible its the nitrous in your gas that turns it into rocket fuel imagine you and all your neighbors are on a life raft in the middle of the ocean and everyday you get gallons of water to share between you that no big deal but what happens when gallons turns to then then and so on the less water available shares the more volatile you and your neighbors get until eventually everything goes mad max and you have all the water to yourself so the speculation boils down tois this the squeeze did it squouze am i too late so what does that mean for the apes that boarded at well nothing the price is going to jump around a lot and every time it should settle a little bit higher than before all the while costing the shorts more and more interest until the squeeze goes off or the market value has reached your cost basis and youre wishing you bought more dip so you could have averaged down and made a profit by now additionally if you assume the price jump was in fact speculative bubble it means the shorts couldnt really have covered without guaranteeing rocket launch those arrogant entitled assholes would have had to look in the mirror admit they lost and launch the rocket themselves or they could lie to you and double down historically they double down because its not their personal money and the hate being wrong almost as much as they hate losing money personally i dont think the shorts will ever capitulate on their own i think that it will end in one of ways sec will turn up some smoking gun of some kind in an investigation that cant be swept away and a scapegoat will be offered to the public their clearing house will call their the short positions in and theyll go belly up the shorts are right and were either too dumb or too distracted to out last them just to be clear these are all short term endings the long term end is basically cohen and friends save gamestop and turn it into a digital platform powerhouse or they dont they got a pretty good track record though i mean chewy sells pet food and toys and its valued at nearly times what gamestop is dont get me wrong i love my dogs but i spend way more on video games each year than i do on pet food and supplies and i dont think im the only one ok so that covers jan but what about today and yesterday well yeah short answer is im not sure but my best guess is that as a result of some options trading practices someone had to buy a bunch of shares to hedge those options and because the available supply is being restricted by all you apes the price reacted extra sensitively kicking off even more hype this would be a good sign as it means that the fuel mixture volatility is getting super powered and just waiting for the right ignition

lteecj,GME,308.23%,gme may have the potential to dictate the course of the entire market i did some research amp analysis,DD,6942,0.96,AR334,1484,before i start i just want to say i am writing this because last time i put up speculative dd and people were tearing it apart because it was very generalized being that i have a scientific background i decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one i hope some of you find it meaningful and i would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism hypothesis gme is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market new york stock exchange nya market cap $ trillion stock listings nasdaq ixic market cap listings sampp mc $ trillion dow jones industrial average djia market cap $ trillion largest of nya and nasdaq tldrabstract i compare the relationship between gme and the worlds largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical ytd quotes the data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between gme and both the nya and djia the data didnt suggest that there is a significant relationship between ixic and gme but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship as gme rises the market responds by dropping based on this data my prediction is that wsb and gme holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market if this data is accurate then gme can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently possibly help for not just gme indicators but also prospective market strategiespositions in short when gme goes up the market goes down tldr for data i found that the nya djia and ixic are negatively correlated to gme nya nyap djia p nasdaq p start i noticed that anytime gme is rallying up my entire portfolio goes red my thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle gme the whole entire market falls as a result however whenever i mentioned this idea ive been met with opposition so i decided to compare the gme to the market indices i mentioned above ampxb gme djia ixic nya ytd datahttpspreviewredditijpbroximxjpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsbdfcdedbfabf if you look at the chart big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in gme price meaning while the whole market collapses gme rises the opposite is also true as gme drops the rest of the market rises the trends based on these comparisons suggest that gme is to some degree controlling the entire market i decided to use some statistics so i can see the likelihood that these are “coincidences” as many have suggested process i calculated covariance correlation and p test matrices based on ytd data from yahoo finance of gme nya djia ixic all data can be found there ampxb covariance amp correlation matriceshttpspreviewredditmswtittmxjpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsebbbbaebceeccdee p values statistically significant values highlightedhttpspreviewredditgwdaxycymxjpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampscdebdaddeabdcfd the results show that there is clear covariance between gme and all of the markets i mentioned the correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between gme and the markets but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices but what was most important was the p values between gme and the nyadjia for those that are not into statistics the pvalue is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on “luck” or “chance” it is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance any pvalue less than is considered statistically significant a pvalue less than basically says that there is less than a chance that the relationships are due to “luck” as you can see there is a chance that the nya dropping is random and a chance for the djia while the ixic does not fit the bill i believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing nya to ixic or when comparing djia to ixic so what does this mean my opinions to me this means that gme does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uberrich but rather a battle for the entire market on january the djia dropped points the ixic points and nya points with just a $ dollar increase in gme imagine what would happen if gme hit a thousand dollars at this point you may be worried that gme may impact the whole market and while that should initially cause worry when you remember the fact that the top own of the entire market you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted its theirs my opinion is that if the short squeeze happens we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen but larger than any society in history has ever seen that liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market final thoughts disclaimers anyway this is just something i wanted to share not trying to convince anyone to do anything to buy anything or not to buy anything none of this is a fact it is vulnerable to error and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it i would love feedback especially if there are any statisticians out there i also want to clarify that this was based on limited ytd data i tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff if anyone has access to quality data i would love to sink my teeth into it i am not a financial advisor edit wow i am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement i received from the community thank you all so much i also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis specifically about the one that goes along the lines of correlation does not imply causation there is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality correlation is a measure for the strength of a relationship meaning it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable in a statistical context the term significant is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective it carries mathematical weight which is established by the ptest the ptest essentially measures the likelihood that the correlation between variables is unrelated meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck if you look on the labels of nutrition items if in the corner of a claim you see a little it means that statement was deemed statistically significant for instance vitamin b claims helps turn food into cellular energy while other vitamins make claims with no in laymans terms the ptest with regards to gme and nya basically says that according to the data provided there is a chance that the two are unrelated or a chance they are related in the scientific community anything below or less than is considered statistically significant also i didnt just test correlation i also tested covariance covariance is not the same as correlation covariance measures the direction of the relationship in this case the very large negative values are indicative of an inverse relationship meaning when one goes up the other one goes down so with that in mind this analysis provides a measure for the direction of the relationship the strength of the relationship and the statistical significance of the relationship apart from that it does not say why or how they related that is purely speculation and i clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data i am not convincing you to buy into mine lastly ive seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data all i have to say is that i spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of dollarshttpsfirstratedatacomcbcompleteusstocksindexetffutures per data set not to mention a bloomberg terminal that costs k a year if someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and i will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it other than that thank you all so much for the support and awards edit the first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility ubigboolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between gme and djia he got a correlation coefficient of which is close to mine of ubigboolean graphhttpspreviewreddituuljdpsyjjpgwidthampformatpjpgampautowebpampscfeabdcaffbc for those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post post your results and i will add them on for reference i used degrees of freedom for my calculations edit ive started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and indepth understanding of applied statistics than i do to all of you experts i welcome your criticism being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed i would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that i can take a swing at myself

ltiai5,None,N/A,grocery outlet is an attractive value investment with tinfoil hat possibilities,DD,47,0.81,Analoghogdog,76,grocery outlet is a boomer bet with overtones of possible insane growth first the bedrock boomer shit grocery outlet buys strategically so they can offer products for to cheaper than the competition essentially they allow my broke ass to eat organic ribeye every night if i so choose go has just locations in states their most recent k was released in and stated they have a longterm potential of locations nationwide go is just getting started their longterm growth is projected as as compared to industries in they plan to expand their number of locations by at least a year this alone gets my dong hard as stated in their k their management is not accustomed to operating a publicly owned business this sounds bad but is actually a good thing imo go is already an amazing business model imagine if an ackmanr cohen type character came in and bought a huge chunk or the company installed a few heavy hitters to help scale the businessin factlast week they added maria fernanda meijaformer vp kelloggs and gail moodybyrdai marketing analytics at noodleai to the board the above would be enough to get me to invest if i were a boomer but as a wsb mutant i need a possibility of a tendie volcano now for storytime how grocery outlet offers deep discounts if a store overstocks a truck gets misdirected packaging changes production changes or any such interruption in the chain of freshness occurs go capitalizes on this while saving the other company from taking losses the chain of freshness you may have heard that up to a third of all food produced by americans is thrown away httpswwwgooglecomampsamptheatlanticcomamparticle the chain of freshness describes how this happens and how food moves food is grown food sent to be processed andor packagedbranded it goes to warehousethis sometimes involves many layers of regional and local warehouses it goes to a store you buy it anywhere during this chain product can get slowed down it wont be fresh enough to be accepted at the next checkpoint in the chain so it goes into a dumpster although the actual freshness of the product may be fresher than you would ever see at a store its not fresh enough to go to regional then local distributors before landing at the store not only fresh enough to consume but fresh enough to be able to sit on the shelf for however long is required by the stores business plan this would be a good time to state that im technically an industry insider as ive been dumpster diving for years ive seen warehouse dumpsters full to the top with product all packaged and nice fresher than you would ever see at a store you may have heard in the news recently about portland police guarding dumpsters full of food from citizens fred meyer said the food was spoiled but it was just unsellable due to liability issues and food quality laws perfectly edible food httpsapnewscomarticleportlandstormsoregoneebdcdfbfbca this is just the tip of the iceberg as warehouse dumpsters are usually behind fences and guarded with cameras so no one sees that waste except for me i fill my backpack with organic chocolate hipflasks of brandy and have personally recovered enough frozen marinated ribs to grill up and play meat jenga withwhich we actually did this waste is caused by logistics problems which could be alleviated by grocery outlet adding value to everyone involved now imagine this company if food waste laws are passed penalizing companies who waste food with images of cops chasing people away from a dumpster full of perfectly good food in the news the discussion is very likely to surface among other progressive talking points grocery outlet is uniquely positioned to profit from this trend if companies were all of a sudden compelled to reduce their waste it would be a huge growth opportunity just based on their current guidance go is a great bet but in this rapidly changing world a newly public company like go with an innovative business model can change its current guidance multiple times tldr a long standing glitch in the logistics of how we sell and move food around leads to dumpsters full of perfectly good food that makes up about a third of all the food americans produce go has a unique business plan that with the help of a bigdick activist investor hiring of corporate heavy hitters and the possibility of food waste laws could turn those dumpsters full of food into dumpsters full of money for everyone involved heres a

shares $ httpsglobalfinancialdatacomeddiegilberttheboywonderofwallstreettextonjunecctheremainingofbrucestock gilbert began buying up shares of bruce in february at to acquire majority ownership of the company as gilbert bought more and more shares bruces stock price rose and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like bruce wasnt worth the price it was trading at in the process gilbert was acquiring all the float in bruces stock as the price of bruce stock rose further the shorts were forced to cover their positions on june the american stock exchange suspended trading in e l bruce stock when the stock soared to $ a share shares were in short supply because the management of e l bruce owned of the outstanding shares and gilbert had taken control over the remaining of bruce stock the shares that were sold short represented the balance between bruce and gilbert typically in a situation like this the exchange would step in negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position and settle outstanding short contracts for cash but gilbert didnt want to do this gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned e l bruce corp although the american stock exchange required that all shorts cover their positions the stock no longer traded on the ase and the shorts had to find shares overthecounter this led to a mad scramble among the shorts and the stock reportedly traded as high as $ as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions short interest in the stock gradually declined from shares on may to shares by august and to shares by september the remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no “fair market” in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established however in aronson v mccormick the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares httpsglobalfinancialdatacomthepigglycrisis saunders vs the shorts clarence saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the new york stock exchange in the corner became so prominent that the whole affair became known as the piggly crisis clarence saunders was generous determined stubborn and wellknown in memphis saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of wall street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in piggly wiggly stock the goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them when the stock declines in price the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price make a profit and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from in a bear raid several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline the bulls on the other hand can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss if the bulls can buy up the existing float the stock is cornered the shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand of course creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price little demand is left for the stock the price of the stock can collapse leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt the whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls piggly wiggly shares started trading overthecounter in july and listed on the new york stock exchange nyse in june in november several of the independentlyowned piggly wiggly stores in new york new jersey and connecticut failed and went into receivership although saunders corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable some wall street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on piggly wiggly stock the bear raiders began selling piggly wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape saunders took this challenge personally he had created piggly wiggly stores created the concept of selfshopping was spreading his stores across the country and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores saunders decided to “beat the wall street professionals at their own game” saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in memphis nashville new orleans chattanooga and st louis to buy up the existing float in the wall street of the s bear raids came and went companies didnt go bankrupt because of bear raids and if the fundamentals of the company were sound the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over nevertheless saunders refused to give in to the wall street city slickers saunders hired jesse l livermore the most famous bear on wall street to help him break the back of the bear raiders within a week livermore had bought shares of piggly wiggly over half the float of shares the bears had shorted piggly wiggly stock in the range but by january saunders bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past the shorts were losing money the shorts are cornered piggly shares were traded on both the chicago and new york stock exchanges in january the chicago exchange announced that the stock had been cornered though the nyse denied that a corner existed so saunders decided to try a new tack he announced that he would issue shares of piggly wiggly shares at $ each saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors saunders pointed out that piggly wiggly stock paid a $ per quarter dividend yielding to investors since this occurred before the sec came into existence saunders could promise that this was a “once in a lifetime opportunity” and get away with it since piggly stock was then trading at $ why would saunders offer shares at $ leaving $ on the table for each of the shares the reason is that saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered the demand for piggly stock would dry up saunders stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan put $ down and pay $ a month for three months since the new shareholders couldnt sell their shares until they were paid for this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions on march saunders let it be known that he controlled all but shares of piggly wigglys outstanding shares he had cornered the shorts on tuesday march saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him by the rules of the exchange the shorts were required to produce the shares by on march the stock opened on the march at ½ moved up to by noon but then dropped to on the rumor that the exchange planned to suspend trading in piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts it was no rumor the nyse did suspend trading in the stock saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on thursday the nd by pm at $ per share thereafter his price would be $ per share the exchange permanently halted trading in piggly and gave the shorts until pm on monday the th to settle with saunders with this ruling the nyse saved the shorts this postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to saunders was it right for the exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in northern pacific in or should the exchange have left the shorts to their fate the nyse justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market saunders wins a pyrrhic victory on friday the rd saunders offered to settle at $ per share in the meantime the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in iowa or new mexico to cover their positions shareholders in sioux city who knew nothing of the piggly crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere $ saunders now had complete control of piggly stock but he was also deeply in debt it is estimated that saunders made halfamillion dollars out of his corner but that proved insufficient to cover his costs after saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds he found that he was five million dollars short half of which was due on september and the balance on january since piggly shares could no longer trade on the nyse saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again offering piggly wiggly shares at $ although the public was sympathetic toward saunders and his battle against the wall street bears the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if piggly wiggly were ruined it would “shame the whole south” memphiss newspaper the commercial appeal lined themselves behind saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince memphians to buy piggly wiggly shares and save their local boy the newspaper planned a threeday campaign to sell shares to memphians at $ a share this was to be an all or nothing proposition if they were unable to sell all shares none would be sold the campaign began on may and soon shares had been subscribed despite this skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign saunders or the public they asked for a spot audit of piggly wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment saunders refused the audit but offered to step down and let a committee run the company skeptics also asked why saunders was still building his milliondollar pink palace when piggly wiggly was possibly in its last throes the pink palace was a huge house built using pink georgia marble the palace was to include a pipe organ roman atrium indoor swimming pool ballroom bowling alley its own golf course and other luxuries saunders promised to board up the pink palace and stop construction unfortunately the campaign was unable to sell even shares and the campaign soon fizzled saunders responded by selling piggly wiggly stores rather than stock to raise money despite selling stores in chicago denver kansas city and elsewhere saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the september payment of $ million saunders turned over his piggly wiggly stock the pink palace which was sold to the city of memphis for $ and opened as a museum in today it includes a replica of the first piggly wiggly store a planetarium a natural history museum and a museum of twentiethcentury memphis and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan by spring saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings if saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy pride went before the fall httpswwwamericanheritagecomjacobschiffandnorthernpacificcorner in james j hill who controlled the great northern railroad and was the largest stockholder in the northern pacific used the latter to seize control of the chicago burlington and quincy a smaller road that threatened the union pacifics territory when hill refused to address harrimans concerns harriman determined to get control of the burlington by seizing control of the northern pacific morgan was hills banker so an attack on hill was a direct attack on morgan before long schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock which had equal voting rights in northern pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority morgan and hill had been caught napping morgan was in europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy common shares of northern pacific at the opening of the market on monday morning may if hill could get a majority of the common he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control the cost at the very least would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars morgan cabled his immediate approval and the battle was joined between the titans those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves on monday morning harriman and morgan held between them of the shares of northern pacific common in existence by the close of the market on tuesday the morgan bank had purchased shares more that left only shares un accounted for but the volume of northern pacific for those two days totaled shares the vast majority of these of course had been sold “short” when too late the short sellers realized what was really happening panic swept the

clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price that morning the firm of street and norton sold shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share ten times what the price had been a week earlier by noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the street itself the morgan bank and kuhn loeb called a hasty truce they would buy no more northern pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at $ a share calm began to return to wall street kuhhn loeb had fought the morgan bank to a standstill this allowed harriman to get what he really wanted which was not control of the northern pacific but attention to his interests from the northern pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary the chicago burlington and quincy railroad harriman was soon on the board the new york times likened the affair to so many “cowboys on a spree shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of

worlds biggest company by market value on tuesday as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by porsche pshgpde short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as euros a share during the session following sundays news that there was less than percent of vw voting stock still floating in the market at that price volkswagens voting stock was worth billion euros $ billion or more than the $ billion market capitalization of exxon mobil xomn vw shares later closed trading on tuesday up percent at euros the share price has rocketed since porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on sunday that it had effectively gained control of percent of volkswagens voting shares in march when porsche was still sitting on a longheld percent direct stake it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to percent bearing in mind that the state of lower saxony holds a percent stake in vw “the speculation of going to percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of vw porsche said at the time “in view of the fact that lower saxony as second largest shareholder owns percent of vw the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low” meanwhile on tuesday a spokesman for german market regulator bafin said it was looking into the vw share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation porsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect “we vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation” a spokesman for porsche said “the ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling volkswagen share price” porsches statement on sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to percent held a further percent in cashsettled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the worlds third largest carmaker to percent next year it said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in vw were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets “without haste and without greater risk” around percent of volkswagens entire market capitalization was on loan as of october the most recent day for which data was available according to financial market data consultant dataexplorerscom this compared with an average percent for all dax stocks the “mother of all short squeezes” as one analyst phrased it led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by porsche dealers said those traders who had sold borrowed vw shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of porsches holding “someone

saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving volkswagen goldman declined to comment but people inside the company said it had no volkswagen losses while a morgan stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker socgen could not immediately be reached for comment but earlier on tuesday said it was sticking with its thirdquarter earnings forecast volkswagen dax weighting shares in vw were up percent at euros by gmt after tripling at one point in the previous session this meant they were trading at around times expected earnings for at a massive premium to rivals such as toyota motor corp t and daimler daignde analysts and traders said the stampede was historic for german large caps but they could foresee vw shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels “the problem is from a fundamental point of view shares are really overvalued but when the short squeeze comes to an end there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down” said one frankfurtbased analyst despite the massive rise in vw shares and talk of little free float remaining the frankfurt stock exchange said it did not plan any changes in the german bluechip dax index but wolfgang gerke a member of the frankfurt stock exchanges exchange council told manager magazins online portal that vw stock should be reweighted on the german dax bluechip index as soon as possible when asked about the current nearly percent weighting that volkswagens stock has on the gauge gerke said “deutsche boerse needs to act now and reduce vws weighting on the basis of its considerably lowered freefloat” the finance ministry declined to comment on the rise in the volkswagen share price and the economy ministry did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment httpswwwmarketwatchcomstorysqueezeongoldmanputfalconeinpenaltybox philip falcone the billionaire hedgefund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement did something many people on wall street wish they could do he put a short squeeze on the vampire squid in goldman sachs gs as the great cephalopod is officially known was shorting distressed highyield bonds from a bathroomfixtures manufacturer called maax holdings inc goldman one of the most powerful investment banks in the world was also encouraging its customers to do the same poor maax the company was just trying to make shower doors sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean poor falcone his harbinger capital owned a ton of these maax bonds and goldman was flushing them right down the drain it is an awful thing to learn goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it people often respond to such news in crazy ways you might remember a firm called lehman brothers back in blaming the entire financial crisis on shortsellers — including a shortselling cabal led by goldman lehman fired back by getting the securities and exchange commission to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks as for falcone well he responded in his own way he grew up playing hockey in a dying minnesota mining town not far from the canadian border he made it to the pros in sweden and now owns a piece of the nhls minnesota wild in hockey if another player smacks you against the wall you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face in hockey this is called sportsmanship falcone according to his confessional settlement with the sec sought revenge against his opponent falcone bought up every piece of the maax bond offering there was he even bought more than there was according to the sec he purchased million more bonds than had ever been issued because on wall street you can always buy stuff that doesnt actually exist this move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that goldman was trying to short and it put goldman right up against the wall goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position thats when falcone said something like “hey squid you want some maax bonds i got your maax bonds right here” and then demanded that goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds now i am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault this call doesnt happen very often though in an arena where such violations occur all the time the sec came down on falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid forcing not just an $ million settlement and a fiveyear ban from the industry but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong “todays charges read like the final exam in a graduateschool course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully” said robert khuzami in when he was then director of the secs enforcement division and announced the charges against falcone i very naively had no idea business schools taught such courses perhaps now that falcone has been banned from his industry he can go back to his alma mater harvard university and teach them “clients and market participants alike were victimized as falcone … manipulated the market for certain bonds … and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales” khuzami added httpsmoxreportscomkbioinfinitysqueeze removed to keep within character limit httpsnypostcomackmanhasbailedoutofhisshortpositiononherbalife after nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on wall street bill ackman has finally given up his $ billion short bet against herbalife the embattled hedgefund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a “pyramid scheme” and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if herbalifes stock falls but ackman also admitted wednesday that the big bold short bet his hedge fund pershing square capital made against herbalife in now looks too risky to stomach any longer herbalife shares are up more than percent this year due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company which vehemently denies ackmans allegations that it practices a predatory business model the rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a “shortsqueeze” in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock theyve sold to make their bearish bets — a move that also drives up the price among those who have bet directly against ackman on herbalife is his nemesis billionaire carl icahn who now owns nearly a quarter of herbalife shares “there is no longer an opportunity to squeeze pershing square” ackman said in a wednesday interview with cnbc instead of shorting herbalife ackman is now shelling out cash for put options which will pay off if herbalife shares drop but which dont pose the risk of a short squeeze unlike holding shares short where pershing squares losses could be unlimited ackman said losses would now be capped at percent of capital — what he called “modest investment” nevertheless “theyre going to charge ackman a premium … for the privilege of him owning a put” ihor dusaniwsky head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm s partners told the post ackmans dealer — who sold the put option — now holds the short position according to dusaniwksy “ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety” dusaniwsky said estimating that this year alone ackman has faced an estimated $ million paper loss on herbalife pershing square declined to comment on its herbalife paper losses or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet or the terms on the new put options it has purchased but that didnt stop ackman on wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company “weve been entirely right on our herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business weve been wrong on the share price” ackman told cnbc herbalifes stock has more than doubled since ackman announced his short position an investigation by the federal trade commission that concluded last year tore into herbalifes business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down pershing square is down percent through the end of september reps from herbalife did not respond to requests to comment herbalife shares were down percent at $ wednesday httpsmediumcomkeithakrevanderbiltandthegreatestcornernevertoldfbffedd the harlem and the hudson were both poorly run lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto manhattan island sensing an opportunity he started to accumulate shares in harlem at the same time vanderbilt was buying there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short that is they were borrowing shares and selling with the hope to buy them back at a lower price netting the difference this group of sellers bears in wall street parlance included members of the new york city council as well as members of the board of directors for harlem rail one of those board members was longtime vanderbilt rival daniel drew with all these inside interests betting on the price of harlem to go down there had to be something going on sure enough a franchise bill that authorized harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded the price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory — except that mr vanderbilt was still on the other side buying everything that was being sold not only did the stock stop going down but it started to rise quickly now for those that do not know shorting a stock can be a dangerous business when you buy a stock go long you only have your investment to lose if you pay $ for a stock it can only go to $ thereby wiping out your investment however if you borrow a stock and sell it short there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing if you borrow shares and sell them at $ and the price goes to $ you have lost your entire investment but if the price goes to $ or $ you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position now imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock if you sold it short at $ and now you have to buy it back to cover your position what price does the owner set this is the danger of being caught short when someone has ‘cornered the market as john brooks explains in his classic “once in golconda “since a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price any finite one is a theoretically a bargain” this is what happened to the short sellers of harlem stock vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy in order to escape complete ruin the city council gave back harlems franchise which now vanderbilt owned outright already this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the commodore a ton of money in the process however this was just the beginning watching this epic battle unfold some wall street speculators decided to attack the neighboring hudson rail line this group thought that vanderbilt must be short of cash after all that buying and attention and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit what they did not know was that vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying hudson shares using futures this was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date the intermediaries vanderbilt used were actually part of the shortselling group who would gladly accept the options from the commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market little did the bears know they were selling this stock to allies of vanderbilt who far from being short on cash still had plenty of powder left when finally he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except vanderbilt himself mercifully instead of raising the price to infinity vanderbilt let the shortsellers off relatively easy they werent ruined merely badly burned within the span of a couple months cornelius vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process daniel drew still stung from his losses in the failed harlem short decided he wanted one more crack he convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of albany to revoke the franchise for harlem overriding the city council if they revoked the license and shorted harlem stock they could make a bit of money as well this turned out to be a fateful mistake from the great game “drews scheme was of course a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring one is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted ‘the statesmen at albany ec stedman a veteran of wall street in the s wrote at the turn of the century ‘in the spring of were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at new york had plunged themselves less than a year before by their bear campaign against this stock yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt as if vanderbilt has proved an easy victim” interestingly the timing on this second attempt to ‘bear raid harlem stock was in favor of the shorts the price went from $ down to $ the greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here instead of covering at a net profit of almost $ per share the shorts tried to press their advantage “they held on hoping to see it drop to $” despite really not being very liquid this time around the commodore was still not easily defeated he rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock the price rose to $ then to $ and by the end of april was all the way to $ feeling less charitable than the last time vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price “asked what to do he bellowed ‘put it to a thousand” fortunately for the shorts and their brokerage houses who also would have been decimated at that price vanderbilt relented and settled at $ “the second harlem corner was over and there would not be another indeed for a full generation on wall street the phrase ‘short of harlem meant much the same thing as ‘up the creek”,2021-02-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltnc32/history_of_short_squeezes_and_corners/

ltpnrj,HF,N/A,why melvin and the other hfs basically have no chance of winningimo,Discussion,2062,0.93,Upper_Piano1809,471,there is only one answer as to how on earth shorting was allowed this is due to the concept of naked shorting this in simple terms is when shorters like big institutions like melvin decide to short the stocks without locating the stock holders basically meaning they are shorting without caring about if their shorts match the supply of holders and this lead to shorting which lead to phantom shares this is all highly illegal except for one exception to the best of my belief youtube it and read up on the sec to confirm otherwise dont believe me an exception to which the government will turn the check is when naked short selling a company that results in bankrupt by which they end up making big amounts of profit why does this even matter its because through these phantom shares they are able to manipulate the ‘failure to deliver system in the stock market and so through manipulating these failure to delivers they trick the algorithm into having to adjust a sell off they do this to trick us and to make us actually fear and cause a real sell off they belief this hype is temporary that will pass they do not realise that we are not cats that are not playing around no more think about it no honestly think about iteveryone was gunning for $ the way in which we are all diamond handing this hold then why would a natural sell off occur only half way its because of market manipulation caused by the restrictions of being able to buy shares the news media penetrating that the interest in gme was over and these failure to deliver and ladder attacks the majority of us are still holding holding through and didnt sell when it went down why well its simple its because the squeeze has not been squoze now back to naked short selling this is market manipulation at its finest but of course gamestop is no longer dead through the great help of ryhan cohens and wsb the giant has been revived once more meaning that there is inevitable death for the hfs as long as we manage to hold shorting requires for interests to have to be paid in order to keep the position open which means that if we hold on long enough we will absorb melvin dry the more hype there is the more these interests go up and thats our key to pulling off a wicked gamma squeeze like nothing seen before usits a great time to be alive and although it may appear on screen that short interest is back under the mark i think that the final of shorts wont be able to be deductible since its made up of phantom shares melvins and all the other hedgefunds only way to succeed was for them to pull this short off in the shadows without anyone realising this stock has been shorted for years but that plan has now epically failed so now they know they have no choice but to use any dirty tactics they can to divide and conquer through any and every manipulation tactics that exist its corruption vs the people unity will prevail if we stay strong together 💎 hold my diamond apes our promised day is near 💎🚀📈📈📈📈📈📈📈 disclaimer this is not financial advice this is merely the thoughts of a smooth brained ape so i honestly dont want you to believe anything i said i dont know what im talking about and im smoking on crayons as we speak the purpose was to point you to the right directions and now i want you to do your own research about naked short selling implications and verify if i am correct to the best of my ability i do believe what i said is right but like i said im a smooth brained ape so i could be wrong theres really only one way to know and thats for you to do your own research take my thoughts with a pinch of salt,2021-02-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltpnrj/why_melvin_and_the_other_hfs_basically_have_no/

lts4ip,PBR,2.06%,due diligence post petrobras pbr,DD,14,0.65,CaiusGnome,36,this post is the sharing of my due diligence for petrobras ticker pbr aka pabst blue ribbon after their most recent q results from thursday february here are the important facts in my opinion cash flow from operations during the three months ended was $ billion usd this represents of their market capitalization during one quarter in q i expect it will be at least $ billion if not more that means if they took the cash on hand at of $ billion plus their cash flows from operations during just the fiscal year they could buy back more than of their current market cap of common stock their stock tends to move in conjunction with oil prices and also the brl local currency compared to the us dollar so when the us dollar is weaker the stock goes up over the past months the us dollar has increased against the brl by about pushing the pbr stock price down during that time i believe with the us stimulus about to pass that this trend will reverse back significantly the recent news on monday regarding the replacement of the current ceo of pbr with a retired general was due to complaints about diesel fuel the stock dropped approximately due to this news when you review the financials you can see in q that $ billion of the $ billion of revenues relates to diesel fuel this is about of the revenues of the company however the discounts that the government is asking pbr to make will not eliminate the revenue it will potentially cause maybe a reduction so this in effect is only a reduction of revenue by also the board of directors has refused to allow this discount so far therefore i believe the stock price decline is much steeper than the effect to the company revenues of the tech industry is declining as interest rates rise investors are in the process of moving into reopening stocks and commodity stocks in therefore this is a tailwind for pbr especially considering that biden wants to shut down oil production in the usa which will further increase the price of oil and will not affect pbr in any way as brazil doesnt restrict the oil exploration function in brazil in the same way that biden wants to in the usa so there will be no impairments on pbrs balance sheet like there will be on the usa companies should biden decide to ban certain oil properties from permitting technically the stock found support on monday february at $ per share and bounced higher on friday february the stock did not cross below $ even when the market was moving lower therefore there is strong support at this level my recommendation is first to review the news and financials on the sec website regarding pbr then i recommend purchasing shares of the company under ticker pbr if you want to increase exposure i also recommend purchasing longdated call options at the $ $ and $ levels for either january or january httpspreviewredditiadyzkjpgwidthampformatpjpgampautowebpampsceafebaefebaabdaa,2021-02-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lts4ip/due_diligence_post_petrobras_pbr/
ltszy8,ROOT,-29.05%,story and dd on root inc $root – the unknown sibling of $lmnd and why i believe it will jump up relatively soon,DD,36,0.78,Shandowarden,41,first i am not a financial analyst or am i here to advise on what to do here to just share my personal insights for discussionentertainment purposes only i sat quite some time writing this mini article up so at least do not downvote my effort thanks tldr and tldr of tldr at the bottom second – what is root inc and what do they do root insurance company provides car insurancehttpsenwikipediaorgwikicarinsurance to drivers in us states root requires drivers to download their mobile apphttpsenwikipediaorgwikimobileapp and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background if the driver passes the driving test they are offered a premiumhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiinsurancepremium which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies root offers a discount to tesla owners who drive using autosteerhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiteslaautopilotautosteer mode making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a semiautonomous vehiclehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiautonomouscarsemiautomatedvehicles in root had its initial public offeringhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiinitialpublicoffering ipo where shares sold at $ each raising $ million which was the largest ipo in ohio history now after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $ httpspreviewredditvbxtfuldkjpgwidthampformatpjpgampautowebpampsfbedaeabcdffd as you can see above this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released they all predicted this stock to bounce between to dollars it got swept hard due to no momentum due to no interest in the stock then – shorted the shit out of it now in the lows undervalued bound to recover – worst case is neutral third sibling of lemonade stock root is a tech company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a persons driving skills better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for root to have to payout insurance claims the great thing is all root customers install the app on their phone and it tracks their driving allowing root to collect more data and improve its model increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car this model is unique and gives root a high moat as well as high potential market share lemonade is an insurance company like root except they are not a tech company their business model is just traditional reinsurance the only thing tech about them is the fact the ui on their website looks good so this brings me to my next point valuations lemonade as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company they have a quarter yes a quarter of roots sales mil vs mil respectively and a higher marketcap somehow b vs b respectively now these evaluations would make sense if lemonade were a tech company and root was not it would make sense if lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies but no it is literally the same as every other insurance company while root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like lemonade should have been this text was a quote from a reddit user upeepeeecksdee in one of his posts what is their current situation ampxb httpspreviewreddittblgfbtgkjpgwidthampformatpjpgampautowebpampsdafecabfd httpspreviewredditebzojhkjpgwidthampformatpjpgampautowebpampscdffadcacdbedbc as you can see the company if insurance has only billion market cap and a relatively cheap price their average volume is only million per day and they started the whole ride from $ down to $ then up to $ and down a whooping to $ first time it was around their first earnings december st the stock plummeted to shits and went from i believe to the exact same situation happened now it went all across down to and ended up the final day in the up s both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee but a huge amount of shares i also preview an image from their statistics of shares shares floated held by institutions right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid and having to drop premiums and plans they reported an ok quarter but i would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which i will briefly mention below optionsputs httpspreviewredditsyjjkjpgwidthampformatpjpgampautowebpampseaadeedbadecad now i do not play or analyze options of callsputs nor do i believe i have a decent knowledge of it but what i can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate i expect puts to be already exercised and closed most of them bet the stock will slide down to the most while consensus and bearish scenario was at around $ now we are literally in the lowest point possible we still have some open contracts for late march where people bet it will be at range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before april when shares unlock next week they will also participate in or seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks i do not expect a rapid price change but a bit green color is to be seen volume because of the immense shorting that happened on friday i believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down now i am no expert but i did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where if the stock was shorted oversold etc it rebounded days andor weeks after i share the images below what happened on friday is a huge selloff and shorting typically this stock trades at mil per day on friday we saw over million of shares being soldbought httpspreviewredditdikokvkkjpgwidthampformatpjpgampautowebpampsefacebbffafbbcce httpspreviewredditppalkjpgwidthampformatpjpgampautowebpampsdeccbfdedcedab as you can see from ibkr data below this shit got shorted by k shares in sweep not a lot of shares are available to short now but i do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers but i was watching diligently the battle in lows range it was changing weirdly jumps of cents once per minute no cent marching strong resistance line at $ bounced previouslyhttpspreviewredditmudnlnkjpgwidthampformatpjpgampautowebpampsadedfbceeb below i am posting their previous earnings report date at december st and how it tanked to the bottom notice the volumes rose heavily and it took weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at $ was pretty good httpspreviewreddithuyyrokjpgwidthampformatpjpgampautowebpampscdbbebfedafddfbcdf lock up season for hunting up in april after that good to buy but what if it is still not worth it to buy well we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios first of all as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known root sucks at marketing even lemonade is better than that and they dont even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their ipo they cut expenses they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available they also have states in their contracts but have not yet acquired new york and i believe not sure about this one california some other states as well the competition in insurance business is quite strong difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road q report and team guidance so basically what will you get from reading the transcript well quite literally they are in the weeds little weeds maybe moderate they are battling losses and licking up their wounds planning out future funds and revenues marketing they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses but expect to doubletriple expenses in the future but what i did like very much is their team and analysis these guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be expenses to be gains to be literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay worst case scenario this will bounce back after covid overall entire industry of insurance is some of transcripts you read are mostly reports on earnings revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever look at $spce transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price market cap guidance is key and in most scenarios i believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part to me it said that basically look we are aware that covid drilled our asses but we have a plan nothings changed we met our metrics and stayed on course this was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago i believe a rebound is soon to happen link

edit forgot to mention in the earnings call they say they have fucking $ billion in cash and cash equivalents at root inc and outside of regulated insurance entities with an additional $ million in cash and investments at insurance subsidiaries this is not a meme stock this is criminally undervalued and undercompared to $lmnd they are in better balance sheets and financial equipment better guidance tldr root inc is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services they got left behind the hype of lemonade and never got to the same scale tobeknownwise this stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by last time this happened it bounced back to nearoriginal price immediately in a week they got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later i see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to dollars line i believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to dollars i would buy shares calls for midlate march expiry recovery and puts for april share lockup ends share price now good for both short term and long term which i like a lot tldr of tldr all time low strong resistance line does not look like a falling knife short percentage big volume more than on friday – bound to recover from dollars at least up

ltw8nt,RAD,2.46%,right time for rite aid rad,DD,36,0.79,Michael_Therami,69,this analysis looks at one possible breakup scenario of the rite aid corporation that projects a return of more than x the closing share price of $ on friday february rite aid rad consists of two parts the retail pharmacy business currently generating approximately $ billion in annual revenues the prescription benefits management pbm services business known as elixir currently generating approximately $ billion in annual revenues one possible scenario for unlocking the value of rad involves the sale of the retail pharmacy business and rite aid brand what is left is the elixir pbm organization here is an estimation of how such an approach might play out in walgreens acquired rite aid stores for $ billion in cash that represents an average price of $ million per store should rad seek a buyer for its retail pharmacy business it could sell its remaining stores as well as the rite aid brand despite the fact that many of these stores are located in highly attractive locations ca oh ma md nj ny pa va etc lets discount the average value of each store by compared to the average priceperstore paid by walgreens and arrive at a relatively conservative estimate of $ million per store at a average price of $ million per store rad could reasonably generate proceeds of $ billion with the sale of the entire retail pharmacy business including the locations and the rite aid brand name assigning no good will value to the brand the remaining rad organization essentially consists of a pbm branded as elixir and a net amount of cash on hand of $ billion assuming that $ billion of the retail pharmacy sale proceeds are used to pay down the entire existing longterm debt on the companys books elixirs projected sales for rads fiscal year ending february are approximately $ billion during each of the past four quarters rad has reported elixirs yearoveryear growth rate to be in the range of elixirs projected ebitda for fiscal begining march of will likely be approximately $ million once again i am taking a conservative estimate and basically considering that a business that has grown each quarter for the past year will suddenly see little to no growth in the upcoming year with only shares outstanding today the $ million ebitda generated by elixir translates to roughly $ per share in earnings using a highly conservative pe multiple of a stock price of $ results however the cashonhand of $ billion from the sale of the retail pharmacy business after longterm debt payoff produces additional value of $ per share resulted in a stock price value of more than $ per share which is more than x the closing price of $ on friday february the newly created company elixir would be wellpositioned for growth in the smalltomidsize opportunity segment of the $ billion per year pbm industry with a net $ billion in cash that future growth could be achieved both organically as well as through acquisition in conclusion this analysis indicates that the conservative value of rad today is $ per share well above the current share price being attributed to the organization by the market which is just under $ the purpose of this post is not to suggest that a breakup of the rite aid corporation is the best strategic path forward i personally believe that the company has the potential to generate a price per share north of $ in the next months if it keeps the entire organization fully in tact rather the purpose of the post was to reveal the hidden value locked within rad that is clearly being overlooked by the investment community by analyzing one possible breakup scenario,2021-02-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltw8nt/right_time_for_rite_aid_rad/

displays how criminally undervalued aso is a company relative to the market as a whole as well as its competitors i have linked a google spreadsheet to this post that shows several key indicators as

dks asos forward pe is as compared to dks asos ps ttm is as compared to dks asos pb mrq is as compared to dks additionally its most recent actual earnings eps were x its predicted earnings eps and its

their few worrisome financial indicators they have a great deal of debt with their debt to equity ratio sitting at as compared to dks however aso has already designated around $ million obtained from their ipo to help pay off some debt is this retail ipo a winner the motley foolhttpswwwfoolcominvestingisthisretailipoawinner they also have the ability to pay off shortterm debt so i do not see this as a company that will likely go bankrupt their current ratio mrq is and although this is significantly lower than many other gunrelated companies it is actually lower than dks which shows that they do in fact have the ability to show off their shortterm debt ampxb short interest while i am not a fan of solely using short interest as an indicator to invest in a stock it can still be a helpful tool according to s researchhttpswwwshortsightcomcategorysresearch asos short interest as a percentage of its float is as compared to dks both of these are fairly high and show that there is great short interest against both these companies although i strongly believe that there will not be a sudden short squeeze over time i believe that sustained stock price growth will force investors to cover their short positions and will definitely help fuel asos stock price growth technical analysis aso has been following a strict channel since its ipo in october as seen below it has bounced off support and resistance multiple times but still remains in this channel aso is currently hitting the bottom of the channel and i believe it will soon bounce back this is a perfect stock for mms to

uuncowisdo pointed out in the comments amazons ath was $ at one point someone also asked why i have and calls if my target price of $ is dated this is because i bought them before i knew the earnings

lx7835,None,N/A,looking at price charts is bad and stupid,Discussion,23,0.69,anikom15,22,tldr buy more $gme retards okay hear me out this is assuming you are investing in companies and not simply trading stocks for quick profits obviously shortterm traders use price charts in all kinds of fancy ways to make their money it seems like astrology to me but apparently enough people are making a living off of day trading so i wont comment further on that investing in companies isnt necessarily longterm it just usually ends up being longterm because companies tend to make more money over time not less so selling early is generally dumb with these boundary conditions established we can get to my point whatever price an asset was in the past says nothing about what the price of it should be today therefore price charts are useless for determining the true value of a stock consider an ideal whore at room temperature it costs $ to sleep with her yesterday it would have cost $ to sleep with her the reason for this price difference is unknown to the market in general and can only be speculated upon does the fact that the price is different have any bearing on your decision to sleep with her it shouldnt here are some conditions you might use to make an informed choice on your financial decision do you have $ to spend is there something more valuable to you for whatever reason that you can pay the same $ for does she have any stds does she have any semblance of a personality etc now you might think well it used to be $ i only have $ now and it might go up in the future that type of thinking is dumb you literally have no idea why the price difference was there you can speculate but its only that speculation this type of thinking is inherently irrational and by allowing it into your decision process you are adding noise to your signal taking away mental processing on considering the types of questions such as the ones listed above so how does this relate back to stocks we can value stocks the same way everyone has his own valuation strategy i look at earnings the companys capacity to grow the markets capacity to grow whether the companys guidance is conservative or aggressive etc when i do this the price chart doesnt fucking help me at all the reason is because this chart doesnt actually give me any useful information beyond what a historical price was this is because price correlates with too many things and we cant break that down to specific indicators that we can actually play upon in essence price charts are more noise than signal when you decide to buy or sell a stock you should be basing it on the current price and your valuation model if you allow yourself to start rationalizing decisions based on price movements youre playing yourself by allowing emotional irrational thinking to become involved astrology again if youre day trading thats totally different and theoretically day traders use other tools like volume to make their decisions not just price charts so what does this have to do with retards on wsb it means stop looking at fucking price charts and selling your shit too early or buying shit just because the stock is cheap right now know what the fuck youre doing or just blindly follow one of the smart retards like dfv either of those things are going to be better than taking a profit or buying the dip on stocks you know nothing about dont allow yourself to get into emotional voodoo by looking for signs through price charts instead look at indicators that have better defined causation earnings dividends debt news etc supplemental information price charting is analogous to the following in my retarded opinion astrology biblical numerology divination flat earth beliefs young earth creationism feng shui crystal healing myers–briggs type indicator scientific racism social darwinism parapsychology anything from mra movements general theory of relativity etc,2021-03-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx7835/looking_at_price_charts_is_bad_and_stupid/

lxal1c,RKT,4.07%,my theory on what happened today in $rkt and how we can avoid this going forward,Discussion,119,0.69,5pencer_,270,as a preface i encourage anyone with hard data that might refute my claims to please do so i am merely sharing a theory that i see as logical and might help us in our fight against the hedge funds ampxb alright guys as everyone has noticed $rkt was victim to a severe pampd over the last hours i have spent all day thinking about why this may have been the case after all it looked absolutely primed for a juicy shortsqueeze and a big w for the apes in the midst of a stagnant war over $amc and $gme this was a planned event backed by the hfs who seem to be gravely short on $gme and $amc i am here to share my theory and how we can learn from today to further pressure hfs positions into squeezing our true guns $amc and $gme i will first share a couple points that i think will adequately set up my theory while hfs were caught with their pants down in january they understand our tendencies and capabilities this time around the hfs are turning our own irratic mob mentality approach against us while we see this as a strength we must understand that our nature can very easily be used against us especially by those with vastly larger amounts of consolidated capital to work with our community is fastmoving and ready to yolo a stock at any time however the hfs can move faster because of their vast resouces their daytrading advantages and their better understanding of our nature this time around they are positioning themselves in spots to act in predatory methods and profit off of us ampxb hfs have realized their one major advantage over us day trading while we always get to see the real bagholders of the community dropping incredible figure amounts of money into stocks and calls we must be real with ourselves and acknowledge that most of us apes do not have at least $k in our portfolios why is that number important day trading i caught rkt on marketopen and saw my combined call and stock holdings soar from $ to $ by close i wanted to sell and reallocate those gains to amc and gme before close but could not because i did not have a daytrade available for me to use these hfs someone correct me if im wrong can daytrade all they want because of the value of their accounts as for us not the case they can act and react to the market at any time without penalty this provides them with a major advantage over us currently in terms of tickers that are not amc or gme ampxb the theory i believe that the hfs are trying to scrape for any method possible to avoid the moass from happening entirely we all see the si and can realize that it is probably to high for the hfs to maintain paying those highfees much longer but what if there was a way for them to raise enough capital to not only offset those fees but continue to short amc and gme to drive the price down and outlast our will i think their answer was $rkt $rkt had that special dividend news that was very exciting to all us apes and stirred up quite the commotion around this subreddit the hfs saw their chance they purchased calls to help push the stock all the way up to what we saw it peak at yesterday then sold those calls to pocket their gains hfs then turned around and slapped those gains into puts just before close hence the dip we saw just before close during ah and pm this ties into my previous point i made about daytrades while many of us would not have had the capability of doing that hfs had the capital to do so upon open this morning the hfs further dumped into short positions on rkt causing price dips panic selling and a downward snowball effect the result a doubledip for the hfs they multiplied their investment on the way up on by simulating a potential squeeze then further multiplied their investment by creating chain panicselling today how does this tie into the main event $amc and $gme i see many apes proclaiming that these types of squeezes that have suddenly been popping up all over are distractions that have been orchestrated by hfs i think that is true but it is much more serious than that not only do these fauxsqueezes serve as distractions to our main cause but they also serve as serious revenue streams for the hfs to survive the capital that they gained from todays $rkt pampd was likely used to not only pay off si fees but to also further short the stocks and drive them down not only does it allow them to drive prices down but it also helps them hurt our group morale as it pertains to amc and gme so how how do we fix this newfound problem we need to be very diligent about the scenario i just outlined rkt looked as primed as ever for an epic squeeze but was rekt within an hour today before you look to all these new squeeze opprotunities remember what happened today with rkt and apply critical thinking as to why this may have happened i have outlined my theory im sure others might have their own theories just please be careful and remember why we are invested in amc and gme we like the stock if we continue to buy into these phonysqueezes hfs can pampd their way to enough capital to potentially kill our positions in the stocks we love i am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice edit thank you for all your opinions i understand that this may be completely wrong

frustrating to see for this company because i believe this company has huge growth potential and i think the institutional investors knows it too my belief is that they are trying to reduce the value of this stock so that they can take advantage of cheaper prices while fooling the retail investors into believing that this stock has no value please read below disclaimer not a financial advisor i

this news is so god damn juicy and the institutional investors knows it but i believe they are currently trying to downplay this to drop the share price of this stock so that they can buy in large amounts at a much cheaper price now why is this news so big sports betting revenue totals for each state across all top betting platforms a indiana – approx $m draftkings accounts for $m fanduel accounts for $m b new jersey – approx $m couldnt find amount per platform but i would estimate approx $m for draftkings going by their annual report figures new jersey is the largest state nd being nevada at m where sports betting occurs if we compare draftkings to fubotv – currently draftkings has about million active monthly users on their platform whereas fubotv currently has approximately k with an estimated growth to over k by end of if even just half of those users were to bet on the platform were looking at approximately $m in additional revenue generated for the company and i think this is being conservative also these are just the initial states that fubotv has secured market access with we should expect more to come soon the company reported a major loss to earnings in their annual report due to approx $m in assetgoodwill impairment why is this important currently the company is reporting approximately $m of net losses for with half of those losses coming from assetgoodwill impairment this impairment occurs due to an overvaluation of assets by the company and they are essentially correcting this asset value we should not expect these large asset impairments yoy because impairment only occurred due to the company overvaluation of intangible assets after the merger with facebank with that said im surprised at how low the analysts earning projections for the company was even though everyone knew about the asset impairment losses prior to the earnings call i think this low analyst projection hurt this company more because it caused a huge net loss surprise to investors customer base doubled ad revenue doubled and revenue doubled from the fact that this is being overlooked by so many investors is crazy to me based on these current projections fubotv should see approx $m of total revenue generation by end of by the time they start generating sports betting revenue were looking at potentially a $b revenue generating company by the end of when we factor in that asset impairments will be much lower by the end of this year i am expecting that the company will start seeing huge net gains by end of according to the grand view research source below the gambling market size was valued at $b in and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of from meaning by the gambling market is expected to be nearly double that of this is a huge and rapidly growing market with plenty of revenue to share across multiple different platforms just because other betting companies may hold a larger share of the market doesnt mean fubotv will not greatly benefit from participating in this market ampxb ampxb these are just the few catalysts that i found from doing a little bit of research there is plenty more but im too lazy to write

weekly daily or intraday charts are remark ably similar gtremember this key principle “each price is a momentary consensus of value of all market participants expressed in action” based on it each price bar provides several important pieces of information about the tugofwar between bulls and bears figure gtthe opening price of a daily bar tends to reflect the amateurs opinion of value they read morning papers find out what happened the day before perhaps ask for a wifes approval to buy or sell and place their orders before driving to work ama teurs are especially active early in the day and early in the week gttraders who researched the relationship between opening and closing prices found that opening prices most often occur near the high or the low of the daily bar buying or selling by amateurs early in the day creates an emotional extreme from which prices tend to recoil later in the day gtin bull markets prices often make their low for the week on monday or tuesday when amateurs take profits from the previous week then rally to a new high on thursday or friday in bear markets the high for the week is often set on monday or tuesday with a new low toward the end of the week gtthe closing prices of daily and weekly bars tend to reflect the actions of profes sional tradersthey watch the markets throughout the day respond to changes and tend to dominate the last hour of

we combined a new ip with some proven mechanics that wed been messing around with and then we tested it for a very long period of time and test markets thats really the structural difference between

then when it started to hit weeks and beyond all the testing that we had done about what were the retention rates engagements we were exceeding them so it was actually really positive to see that the test marketing worked and that was a critical part of the success here the harry potter ip is a money machine if you can integrate the game mechanics that get people to continually make micro transactions or spend hours playing combined with a raving fan base of an established global ip imo this is going to print money for them the harry potter game was launched on sephttpsinvestorzyngacomnewsreleasesnewsreleasedetailszyngalaunchesharrypotterpuzzlesspellsworldwide i think we could see a lift in revenue in the coming quarters from this game ampxb upcoming game releases in the first half theyre targeting new game releases in the first half puzzle combat and farmville on puzzle combat gtso as we think about releasing puzzle combat in the first half i wouldnt necessarily set the expectations that this is a theatrical movie model where its a marvel movie that comes out at summer and its got this huge spike thats not at all the model here right were in this for the longterm this is a marathon not a sprint and so were going to be releasing the game see how it settles in and then very methodically start acquiring based on what were seeing in the dynamics and the metrics on farmville gtand there are a lot of fans that have tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of people had played farmville over the years and when we think about all of those fans and what their expectations are and how to bring them into a new experience weve doing a lot of testing were also running a bunch of farmville games right now whether its country escape or tropic escape which has a very big fan base and they love the game gt gtand so its a little bit more complicated to navigate some of the preset expectations but what weve done is really build out a terrific new experience and experience that is unlike la it has things that are familiar to people that have played farmville in the past but its got a lot of unique new elements to it and a new look and feel that feels very modern and very cutting edge for what we believe mobile games really are these days puzzle combat is more of a long play and i like these types of strategies mixed in with shorter term plays zynga seems to have a healthy balance of this which i really like what i think zynga does well is tailoring their games to the fan base i think fv is going to be a fresh reboot of the beloved game by its fans with new elements to keep users engaged ampxb expansion into crossplatform gaming as mentioned they acquired echtra to boost their expansion into crossplatform gaming unrelated to the acquisition one of the first crossplatform titles later this year will be star wars hunters ampxb gtyeah i think if you take a step back and look at the industry overall some of the largest franchises in the world right now are crossplatform and theyre free to play in many cases with seasons passes and things like fortnite pub g engine impact a lot of people have been talking about how the console developers getting into mobiles the thing well i think that door swings both ways i think mobile developers can actually step into the crossplatform mega franchise part of the market because of a few reasons ampxb regarding the team they acquired ampxb gti think the last point id make on crossplatform is that were just getting started in this so the acquisition of echtra is really a key one for us because ultimately game quality is a function of game team talent and leadership and when you look at these guys theyve worked on rpgs for up their whole careers theyve worked on diablo they helped to create torchlight which is a fantastic ip and the action rpg category theyve actually published games crossplatform its a team less than in san francisco right near our shop i think if the launch of star wars hunters goes well in the second half of the year then i think its possible we see a nice upward movement on the price ampxb becoming a first party ads platform cutting out third party platforms like googleapple ampxb gtmidpoint the last year we started looking at the fact that we were one of the premier advertisers in gaming all of our games are enabled for iap and iaa but between the time that they saw an ad and they ended up in our game we had it was kind of opaque right we worked with other parties – other third particles or use other thirdparties like iron source or unity app and google facebook and the thirdparties were handling a lot of the information and a lot of the acquisition and then we looked at our first party data asset which is the data that we were generating around what a player was doing inside of our games gt gtand that was tremendously valuable but we were missing that piece of it and so when we looked at it we said wait a second if we do a couple of things here we can capture the to were paying partners right now just to manage the exchanges we would get more information about whats hot and whats not at the top of the funnel in terms of whats appealing whats not appealing what companies or products are doing better and why we would be able to creatively optimize our products better we ended in a post idfa world that would all become first party data the big issue with privacy is what is one party exchanging to another party about an individual right but if you enter one network and you have a good exchange of what your permissions are you carry through that whole process in a high fidelity way from a data standpoint gt gtand so when we looked at it from multiple directions were like wow we can margin expand we can pick up more efficiency in our ua dollars and in our advertising business we could grow our advertising business faster and we could generate potentially a competitive advantage and information superiority just knowing more about the players coming into our walled garden or into our platform than the next guy gt gtwe felt like this was something that we could go after we went through a very diligent process of breaking down what these look like and we found that some of these components we could build some of these components we need to partner on and in addition to that in ad tech theres a lot of theres really a lot of vibrant companies and opportunities out there to potentially partner as youve seen from recent development gt gtso when we think about where we were as a company we were a mobile pure play developer and publisher and we felt that that is a really valuable company but we thought that we could become an even more valuable company by building out our platform by starting to grow our total addressable market by getting into consoles and pcs and then leveraging this unique asset and hyper casual to really supercharge the platform as well as get us into a place where were seeing more information coming into the top of the funnel and then converting them into players and ultimately payers this really sticks out to me zynga was step ahead from the new pivot by applegoogle on stronger ad tracking privacy theyre becoming the ads exchange where companies pay for displaying ads in games this also gives them an advantage on learning whats working for others and apply that to their business model heres a bite sizedhttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsljywiczngautmsourceshareamputmmediumiosappamputmnameiossmf dd ujojofroyo did disclaimer this is not

lxf7y0,None,N/A,whats happening with the bond market or how i learned to be a 🏳‍🌈🐻,DD,462,0.91,shitilostagain,408,preface gme apes hold on to gme with your diamond hands this is not a ploy to get you to sell nor is this post for you this entertainment not financial advice this is just a 🏳‍🌈🐻 look into the bond market and why you are seeing red and will continue to tldr first so anyone interested in taking a trip into the bearcave and coming out the closet on the other side can understand whats happening tldr the fed is no longer in control of interest rates stocks are artificially inflated due to the fed injecting money into the economy with nowhere for it to go but to investments with stocks offering the highest returns of all possible investments this used to not be an issue as the fed was in control of how much qe could be done through open market operations as they were the buyers but as the money supply is now enormous coupled with rising money velocity the fed will now have no choice but to start the process of qt but to do that they need to sell bonds which they are struggling to do due to low interest rates to sell more bonds to reduce the money supply they will have to increase interest rates resulting in a sea of red and the🏳‍🌈🐻s taking a trip to tendietown part macro review if you are comfortable with macroeconomic concepts feel free to skip this part this section is just definitions for the retards on the short bus that flunked out of econ for this dd we will need to understand the concepts of money supply money velocity open market operations qe and qt money supply is the total amount of money in the economy money velocity tells us how fast money is changing hands through the economy more info at httpsenwikipediaorgwikimoneysupplyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikimoneysupply and httpsenwikipediaorgwikivelocityofmoneyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikivelocityofmoney open market operations refers to the fed purchasing or selling securities on the open market which is one of three monetary tools the fed has at its disposal with the other two being the discount rate and reserve requirement which are not important for this dd qe and qt refer to quantitative easingtightening which is where the fed performs open market operations to either increase or decrease the supply of money in the economy part whats been happening so far now that we have let the retards off the short bus lets discuss where we are right now at a macroeconomic scale and how we got here i want to get to what is happening with the bonds and i will try to keep this as short as possible as we all know the fed has been printing money like crazy since last year with jpow money machine go brrrr as a result the money supply has gone through the roof since the pandemic hit which we can see below in the m graph ampxb m money supplyhttpspreviewredditrkdtvpykpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsfcddeeeffeb unless you have been living under a rock this past year the reason the government has been printing money like crazy is due to the money velocity falling like a rock due to the coronavirus pandemic if money velocity is down people and businesses arent spending and if people and businesses arent spending the economy contracts hence the need to inject money into the economy just to keep it afloat ampxb velocity of m supplyhttpspreviewreddityqsccpykpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampscbbcddeeebcb the primary way that the fed has been dumping money into the economy is through quantitative easing meaning that the fed will buy bonds and other securities during open market operations aka operation bears r fuk this effectively allows the government to exchange existing securities on the market for cash freeing up money in the economy while the average citizen has been getting bent over a barrel with a vacuum attached to their wallet the stock market has gone fucking insane over the past year why because for the most part corporations institutions and boomers hold the instruments such as treasury bonds that are repurchased by the fed during open market operations which those groups and people then insert right into the stock market because there is nowhere else to park their money corporate bonds have been either risky or have low interest rates us government bond interest rates are garbage businesses have been risky investments due to the rona and only the stonks market has gone up if we look at just before the pandemic to today the value of all the stocks in the sampp have increased around trillion dollars the graph that shows this can be seen here httpsychartscomindicatorsspmarketcaphttpsychartscomindicatorsspmarketcap keep in mind that the gdp shrunk around last year and unemployment is still relatively high meaning that this growth is absolutely not organic at all part what looks to be happening ok that was long now onto the bondslets think about whats been happening so far over the past few bear weeks bond yields go up market takes a massive shit calls on $rope increase in value the bearcavetm becomes the hot new club right now yields have nowhere to go but up and the fed has no choice but to increase them thereby tanking the market which we will see next as the money velocity increases as the economy opens back up the amount of total money flowing around will increase as the same dollar will move faster through the economy artificially inflating it if we keep the money supply the same as it is now while increasing the money velocity we will have a serious problem on our hands this is because the value of the economy as a whole has not increased so more money will represent the same pool of goods causing an extreme amount of inflation the money printer was good when the economy was shut down and saved our asses from a great depression part electric boogaloo but will cause inflation unless the money supply is reduced as money velocity increases the fed knows this and are currently in the process of issuing new debt in the form of bonds httpswwwmarketwatchcomstoryrecordbillionofnewtreasurydebtissuanceposessupplytestforshellshockedbondbuyershttpswwwmarketwatchcomstoryrecordbillionofnewtreasurydebtissuanceposessupplytestforshellshockedbondbuyers this is quantitative tightening in action with the fed now performing open market operations to reduce the money supply to prevent all that money from flooding and tanking the economy but there is a problem that the fed is currently facing which is that nobody wants bonds that have shit interest rates to get people to buy their bonds they have no choice but to raise interest rates time is also ticking as the economy is reopening and the money velocity is increasing as can be seen in the fred money velocity graph meaning that if the fed doesnt raise rates inflation will become a problem very quickly and they will have to sharply increase rates or the entire us economy will be extremely fucked as a side note the ratio of increase is higher in m than m which could potentially exaggerate damage to consumers unfortunately for the stock market but fortunately for the 🏳‍🌈🐻s who have not been hunted to extinction as bond yields increase money will flow from the stock market to other securities as well as back into the general economy reducing the total funds in the stock market causing it to crash part my dance moves phew that was long unfortunately as of the writing of this post it looks like higher interest rates could be around the corner at any time and the higher they get the harder the market will drop as money flows from stocks to bonds and other less risky securities to take advantage of this i plan to exit some long positions and swap them for cash as well as shares and calls on inverse market positions such as uvxy sqqq and spxs again this is not financial advice and if you buy stocks that people mention on the internet without properly researching them first you are actually retarded ampxb edit not financial advice hi everybody it looks like my post gained some traction last night as a thank you to those who have read and commented i will address some of the questions and points people are having in this edit so they are visible to all one of the more common questionspoints is that the fed just wont allow rates to raise because they dont want it to again like it says in the dd at this time i do not believe the fed is in control of the interest rates and will quickly have no choice in the matter no matter what daddy jpow says they will do it may not happen today or this week but it is coming as money velocity goes up with the same amount of money in the system due to economic reopening inflation takes off like a bat out of hell if inflation goes up the us dollar becomes less valuable and if it goes up too much the us govt will have exciting new problems to deal with to reduce the money supply through qt the only real tool that the government has is open market operations to sell securities on the open market to reduce money supply meaning that they need to sell bonds which will require higher interest rates because they just arent selling with the shit rates they are at now the rates must increase to prevent widespread economic pain another question is that why hold cash if there is inflation wont i lose money that may be true that your money will become less valuable if inflation takes hold but you will have much less of it if you hodl during a crash or try to time the market ok now that some questions have been answered bonus round first lets talk about why the market crashes when funds flow out the best way to think about the total market price at a macroeconomic level is through supply and demand if we say that the supply is the total number of stonks in the market and demand is the amount of money in the market we can see that generally the total money flowing in or out of the market is what determines market value as the supply of stocks for sale is not changing a lot on a day to day basis across an index or a market another thing to realize is that the fed is between a rock and a hard place if you think about it no matter what they do there will be pain and someone will end up getting kneecapped holding bags loaning out money to get people to buy bonds looks bad as it looks like a government scheme to con people into buy worthless bonds capping bond rates will kneecap and effectively nationalize the bond market potentially sending shocks through the system do nothing and inflation fucks everything raise rates and the market gets flushed down the toilet rates are also so low they cant be decreased further finally no matter what happens in the market uvxy sqqq and spxs are currently at rock bottom prices there is little room for them to shrink but an enormous amount of room for them to grow once again thanks everybody and this is not financial advice ampxb jpow interview and bond activity update as of pm interview sauce httpswwwwsjcomvideowatchjeromepowellatwsjjobssummitffdfceebabbcehtmlhttpswwwwsjcomvideowatchjeromepowellatwsjjobssummitffdfceebabbcehtml us year bond yield rates httpswwwcnbccomquotesusyhttpswwwcnbccomquotesusy ampxb ok this will be the last update on this dd before i let it ride and see what happens after watching the jpow jobs summit interview there are three things to take away with the first two relevant and the third being very important first is that at powell mentions that as spending surges due to reopening the fed will be expecting excess inflation this is largely in line with and provides some evidence for my claim that as the money velocity increases we will have inflation due to the money supply not contracting enough to prevent inflation the second is that for now until the fed sees its goals met ie max employment and price stability or until inflation becomes a problem the fed will continue its policy of qe timestamps amp this will continue to inject money into the economy so no big surprise there but do keep in mind that this money printing will need to be continually managed through selling treasury securities back on the open market so if there continues to be trouble in the bond market that may potentially have an effect on the current qe being undertaken the first two things are not surprising but the third big takeaway is quite important which is that the fed is prepared to combat excessive inflation by raising rates at powell was asked about the market sentiment that the fed will raise rates earlier than expected his response was that the fed will not raise rates unless the labor market is at full employment or if inflation becomes excessive as of now inflation is around and the fed has a target of powell mentioned many times that they are okay with inflation being a bit over that as long as it is transitory but at powell also said that the fed will not let inflation get out of control and was very adamant about that the third takeaway is important as when coupled with the the fact that the rising money velocity will increase inflation as well as the fact that the us govt is struggling to unload bonds it seems to suggest that the fed will soon indeed have no choice but to raise rates to prevent excessive inflation due to the large money supply coupled with increasing money velocity the sentiment in the bond market seems to agree with the year treasury yield up by basis points today to this is also good evidence for my thesis that money from the stock market will rotate out into bonds and other investments as yields have no choice but to improve and again today has been another bloodbath in the stock market if this continues i would fully expect to see more money rotate out of stocks further crashing the stock market see yall at my new favorite club the bearcavetm again not financial

advertising space amp connected tv very good solid financials very good valuation undervalued like crazy short interest someone look it up but its anywhere from good industry solid financials undervalued high short interest very good introduction pubmatic is in the programmatic advertising space and is a supplyside platform ssp where it works with publishers to maximize their advertising revenue and if you dont know much about that space let me tell you about three other companies that have benefited tremendously from the secular tailwinds in this space the trade desk $ttd magnite $mgni acuity ads $acuif the trade desk magnite acuity ads have all benefited tremendously from the big shift to programmatic advertising bunch of ads that show up on various websites based on your interests and most of all connected television ctv where legacy cable advertisers are shifting their ad dollars to move into digital advertising within televisions ie hulu roku imdb etc there are big dollars moving from legacy tv to digital tv and traditional advertising to programmatic advertising just look at their stock prices in the past yearyears ttd mgni acuif anyway going back to pubmatic this little company ipod in december and basically for most of december didnt have much movement in their stock price unlike our little friends above who saw their stock prices skyrocket in the month of december then come january and february pubmatic started getting some traction as investors started realizing pubmatics potential in this space but the real reckoning came when they announced earnings on february where they not only beat earnings they crushed earnings and they did one even better they gave solid guidance for q and fy despite having little visibility into the back half of financials ampxb revenue in $ ms qqqqtotal $ $$$$$ $$$$$ $ ampxb revenue yoyqqqq vs vs look at that revenue acceleration from to by q and guiding for which they will easily beat by at least a few points if not more most companies guide with some padding they are also gaap profitable most tech companies are nongaap profitable due to stockbased compensation which cuts into earnings but this little company is profitable already their net income margin for q was which is incredible and for the year they finished with a net income margin despite covid beating the crap out of this business in q this is a company that is executing brilliantly and has done so profitability as well they also have really happy employees and a bunch of reviews too httpswwwglassdoorcomreviewspubmaticreviewsehtmhttpswwwglassdoorcomreviewspubmaticreviewsehtm valuation when it comes to tech companies given their lack of gaap profitability they are often valued on an enterprise value to sales ratio evs ampxb company namettm evsq growth rateq guidancemarket cap the trade desk$ b magnite pro forma proforma$ b pubmatic$ b pubmatic is growing significantly faster than the trade desk and magnite and has a multiple that is at least less this makes no sense how is a company growing faster than its peers that offers a product that has a ton of traction and executing brilliantly valued so much less if they were to get an equal multiple this stock would be trading in the $ range at least short interest amp volume now it gets interesting i have no idea if the sources im reviewing are correct but this is what im seeing httpsfinvizcomquoteashxtpubmamptycamptaamppdhttpsfinvizcomquoteashxtpubmamptycamptaamppd it shows short float at which seems like a lot to me another article per thestreetcom shows short float at

i have no idea which source is correct all i know is this stock is incredibly volatile despite solid results perhaps its due to it being a new ipo or something but the stock skyrocketed to $ before cratering down to $ due to the recent market volatility and i wouldnt doubt that the high short float whatever it is is causing that to some degree regardless it does seem like a prime candidate for a potential short squeeze if $rkt could double with a short float of or so and it being a $ b company prior to the squeeze i would anticipate a company that is lt $ b in market cap and doesnt have a ton of trading volume everyday could see some potential uptick wrapping up i think pubmatic is a great company they seem to be executing flawlessly and are guiding for continued strength and are in an industry with huge secular tailwinds i anticipate this company will do very well by its own but given how much short interest there is this could be an interesting play too disclosure long $pubm

probably wont change since i just started to actually use bren but then i look and its way different some of yall are gonna hate but ive been watching rkt alongside since this week funny thing is when rkt went up in one day gme started dropping correlation edit the short interest on borrowing shares of rkt was the other day march rd rkt went up or so to a high of like $ on march rd today it went back down to mid s and the borrow rate is still citdadel has short positions in both they cant win on both sides so they had to sell rkt positions increasing the price massively since there was a high demand because “ dividend news” finally hit main stream and a bunch of subs started pumping it making citadel insane profits on the way up and on the way down mind you the dividend news was from jan i believe so it was all coordinated to make online retards bag holders and so apes bought it and some sold for loss others sold for good gains but others are just holding because they too now like the stock it has borrow rate and only k shares available as of pm est march th so they make money on rkt going up and down continue short laddering gme to keep the price suppressed it all worked in their favor but rkt doesnt seem to be dropping below $or heck it wont even go below $ because ill buy more lol some diamond hands got in and started fucking shit up like me hehe shares wassup baby mind you beginning of march and even at its ipo rkt was only at $ during their ipo they only put out of their float because there wasnt a high demand the news “oddly didnt cover or care about their debut”

lxt0bx,RAVI,4.04%,updated ravi trading guide,Chart,9,0.69,SpicySlavic,5,after testing ravi indicator for about weeks making mistakes and looking into them i decided to make an improved updated guide so others who discovered this from me wont make the same mistakes that might cost them big ammounts of money the guide has no attempts at the big funny and just focuses on being simple ro read this is an infraday indicator for day tradingscalping so just like last time a step by step which stocks to trade not all stocks work with ravi in fact most probably wont there are strict requirements to guarantee daily profits here they are volatility a stock must move in at least a daily range on previous days volume a stock must have good regular ammounts of volume for the majority of the first half of the day if you see that a stock has abysmal volume yesterday its a good idea to not trade it today indecisiveness ravi is great at predicting when a stock is hitting a floor or a ceiling so the more ups and downs is has the better if a stock is gradually growing nonstop infraday it damages accuracy of the indicator severely it would still be mostly accurate but a risk of a big loss would be looming at any time ampxb perfect environment for ravi tradeshttpspreviewredditnpfvulpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsfaefffdebaadec how to enter once you turn on ravi indicator available on etoro charts and yahoo finance make sure to leave the default settings on the indicator mostly has white lines once one of them becomes red or green it is a signal for entry go long on red lines and go short on green lines respectively split your money never go all in on the first candle my most effective strategy is to split your money in parts explained below do not enter in the first minutes of the market open no matter the conditions market go ape shit and you never know what to expect trading ravi in this time is very risky if you see a stock with big volume on market open while yesterday has bad volume in the nd half of the day ignore ravi for minutes if the opening price has made a big jump since yesterdays close ignore it for minutes as well do not stack the ignoring periods on the ravi indicator you can see two thresholds usually a and which are used to calculate entries if a market opens already crossing the thresholds and stays there for a while ignore this stock for today or increase the thresholds the last option relies purely on experience and has minor risks do not enter into a position until the signalling candle finishes forming it could become even more signalling or stop being signalling completely in seconds split your money this isnt rocket science nor did i come up with this but with ravi it is essential to prevent losses and increase yields split your money in when entering a trade example you see a redbuy signal and go long with but it keeps going lower once it goes lower significantly enter again with another rd of your money you now have invested this is will increase your overall profits and allow you to break even on otherwise losing trades it is very important and saved my ass countless times during testing once the price bounces exit for a profit at your personal choice mine is total gain per single trade both entries count as trade at last the other of your money remaining is to be reserved for an emergency the price could continue to go lower for a short time potentially making the trade negative even after pullback if you see that situation use the last rd of the money to enter for one last time defending your position and exit as soon as the position breaks even dont wait for profits if you invested of your money this is however quite rare and becomes even more rare with experience ampxb an example of risk management entries with ravi with other indicators this strategy actually increases risks but not with this one it does the opposite this particular trade is the one i had the bad luck to fall into today when mr jpow had the entire market nosedive for about minutes and i was clueless regardless i ended up benefiting from the trade anywayshttpspreviewredditqfadlpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsecccacdffdddfc how to exit this is the biggest difference from my first guide not gonna lie it was kinda retarded and i ended up losing money because of it here is a much better version tested for more than a week since then number one rule of trading this indicator dont be greedy from looking at countless tickers and situations i concluded that the vast majority of trades yield a before becoming risky and risk management is insanely important with ravi yes its not massive but you will only need about trades a day for a daily gain a respectable daily goal for professional day traders with only k money in the game it gives you $ per day or $ per month work days if you had to do three entries of your money exit as soon as you break even net total not on each individual entry entry trades are quite rare and usually related to bad news causing unexpectedly big moves when news ruin a trade you can still sometimes benefit from it but it is generally safe to exit breaking even just remember than when you have all of your money in the trade you have no more capital left to defend your position in case of a failure and if after breaking even the price begins to go opposite again youre fucked ampxb additional tips in very rare situations you might have a weakening signal during a trade without confirmation i couldnt find examples on charts since it happened to me more than a week ago so here is a hypothetical example ampxb self explanatory but anyways you go long price goes even lower but at the same time signal is becoming weaker which means that it will be extremely hard to return to levels to profit from the initial entry if you used the times splitting strategy you are likely to still escape losses or even profit but that is up to your risk management the best way is to exit these trades as soon as you can when you spot themhttpspreviewredditmgvhclpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsadafccbcdabededb dont be a pussy sometimes price will continue to go against ravi signals but do not be scared and do not exit for a loss unless you see one of the situations mentioned above hodl is actually a valuable advice with here do not trade last hours of the market even if the volume is acceptable you might get caught in a trade that will have to be finished tomorrow a massive risk to take always remember indecisive stocks best stocks always check for news you do not want any big news before you start trading as they usually drive price in only direction and its hard to profit from them with ravi be careful when entering on signals if they happen on retests of a very recent supportresistance you could get yourself into a very risky situation although splitting your money will usually save you regardless do not use this indicator for any other methods of trading it works awfully with hour day candles as well as being completely useless with creep toe hi mods because of the spread other people suggested more uses for ravi but i did not test them ampxb ps the entire guide comes from my personal experience if you see a mistake prevention tip here it is because i lost money and learned how to avoid it next time with this current version of the guide i have been green on the last days with average profits ranging from to daily this is hopefully the final version but i will add more tips if i happen to find another dangerous trap to avoid criticism of my method is welcome,2021-03-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxt0bx/updated_ravi_trading_guide/

racist regardless of your political beliefs were all here to make money basic supply and demand indicates that discontinued books will skyrocket in value if demand increases sure enough within two days these banned dr seuss books are now worth their weight in fucking goldhttpswwwcbrcomdrseussbannedbookssellhighpriessecondaymarket heres a breakdown by numbers im using data from barnes and noble

$ gt $ increase if i ran the zoo $ gt $ increase on beyond zebra $ gt $ increase scrambled eggs super $ gt $ increase mcelligots pool $ gt $ increase and to think that i saw it on mulberry street $ gt $ increase every single one of these is a literal tenbagger whats even more crazy is that this insider articlehttpswwwinsidercomclassicchildrensbooksthathaventagedwellifiranthezoobytheodorseussgeiselakadrseusshasbeencriticizedforcontainingnumerousoffensiveimages sort of called it almost two years ago—the first book on their list is if i ran the zoo in addition to the above mentioned insider article i looked through several lists of books that are being challenged for racial content my analysis leads me to believe that the indian in the cupboard by lynne reid banks currently being published by harper collins is a prime candidate for a discontinued book squeeze heres why low search volume heres a google trends graph of how often the recalled dr seuss books were searched for on amazon httpspreviewredditdbuhtllpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsadbcdabeedfbdcdffda notice how theres nobody trying to buy these books this makes sense no publisher in their right mind would discontinue a popular childrens book this is why books like the cat in the hat or peter pan which have also been criticized will never go out of print it would be a financial nightmare in contrast look at how indian in the cupboard stacks up against some other contenders ampxb httpspreviewredditxedbpunlpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsedeaecdbaefcb if you follow the red trendline you will see that searches for indian in the cupboard amazon are effectively with some slight upticks every now and then this contrasts with amazon searches for titles like little house on the prairie which sees consistent search frequency discontinuing further printings of the indian in the cupboard will probably have little impact on harpercollins margins broad readership base particularly among middleaged readers in addition to being discontinued a book will need to have excess demand before the price will surge this will happen only if the book has a broad readership base in dr seusss case so many adults have probably read at least one of the discontinued books growing up hell i loved mulberry street when i was little which is why theyre actually buying up these books now that theyve become limited edition items it probably helps that dr seuss wrote his books to help children read and literally every elementary school still uses his writing to teach literacy skills similarly the indian in the cupboard was actually wellreceived in the s and was incorporated into school curriculums nationwide you can still find entire teaching guides built around the indian in the cupboard and i distinctly remember reading this book and filling out worksheets back in third grade yeah this book isnt as popular as it once was but im willing to bet that in the years that its been out its been able to build a solid fanbase of readers who will buy a copy out of nostalgia once this book gets banned this also gives the indian in the cupboard an advantage over books like pippi longstocking which—despite being a childrens book with low search volume—is beloved in sweden but has a much smaller audience in america history of contentious debate the controversy over dr seusss books didnt just happen overnight although it certainly felt that way his books have been banned in libraries for years and there are argumentshttpswwwnbcnewscomnewsnbcblkreckoningdrseussracistimageryhasbeenyearsmakingn going all the way back to the s about whether his books are racist this is the same situation that the indian in the cupboard finds itself in its been removed from numerous public libraries and the american library association leadership advised educators to avoid the book as far back as this is important because the decision to remove books is typically timesensitive given almost years to consider whether or not to discontinue publishing harper collins likely has enough financial data and a good picture of consumer preferences especially under the current political climate to decide that they will stop further publications of the indian in the cupboard its important to keep in mind that there is significantly less liquidity with trading books than stocks however books are still less volatile and like art pieces tend to appreciate in value over time i think that the indian in the cupboard is a longterm hold which has the potential to increase ten fold when it inevitably gets pulled from

ly4lze,A,6.30%,a class gamma squeeze,DD,389,0.91,Outthemud247,138,i want to share the very definition of a gamma squeeze people keep pushing a gamma squeeze but dont actually know what a gamma squeeze is “in a gamma squeeze the price of a stock transiently increases based on an investor buying many options to drive up the prices of select stocks due to option sellers needing to hedge their trades on the underlying stocks “ the reason gamma squeezes are even a thing is because of this they dont have to own shares to sell you shares therefore not really costing them much with options because they are more riskier and more volatile they have to make sure they have those shares available which causes them to hedge those options thus costing them more than it would if they just sold you shares where the gamma squeeze actually happens is when you have multiple weeks of high options volume coupled with options expiring in the money high volume call option purchasing drives the price up which in turn helps the upcoming expiring contracts to expire in the money causing them to be covered which causes the price to go up even more now one week of this most hedge funds can recover and regroup from but multiple weeks they cannot often times at this point if the stock isnt already heavily shorted any short positions begin doubling down often leading to the stock to be shorted this is why gamma squeezes can lead to short squeezes though not a guarantee i want you to understand the simple concept of what a gamma squeeze is so you arent just expecting something you havent fully understood yet more less just throwing money into a stock aimlessly you may not like what im saying but anyone who knows anything about a gamma squeeze knows im telling the truth im just simply wanting people to understand what a gamma squeeze actually is and that each day that passes that option volume does not increase the less likely a gamma squeeze can happen you can refuse to acknowledge the facts or you can simply understand the fundamentals of what a gamma squeeze is a gamma squeeze is not something that magically happens its happens with consecutive weeks a high volume of options investors with calls expiring in the money yes borrow interest ssr etc are all great things but those things alone dont cause a gamma squeeze increased option volume forcing sellers to hedge the shares for those options is the very definition of a gamma squeeze borrow interest short available ssr etc arent some magic wand they just set up the ability for a gamma squeeze to happen on another notethere is also a quadruple witching date coming up on if you dont know what it is just type it in your google search engine and read which adds to the possibility for a gamma squeeze to happen the day alone doesnt guarantee anything in addition to that friday was great and those ftds helped the possibility of a gamma squeeze but that alone wont cause it i honestly would imagine hedge funds laughing at people trying to gamma squeeze them without actually buying a lot of options actually i know they would be laughing at people trying to gamma squeeze them without buying a lot of options because you cant have a gamma squeeze without buying a lot of options its like trying to start a car with no gas high volume of options investors is the gas for a gamma squeeze without gas options investors that car gamma squeeze goes no where and if you only fill that car up once ftds from last friday itll start but it will only take you so far before it runs out of gas i wouldnt share this if i didnt want to see all of the people that have invested money into amc win i want to see you guys win it would be a sad day if i sat back while you hope for a gamma squeeze and not tell you what a gamma squeeze actually is great night apes this is not financial advice just a mere essay teaching gamma squeeze basics class thanks to this community because every other community has silenced me its really led me to believe that some of these communities are ran by hedge funds themselves trying to manipulate people and lead them astray i had speculated that but the fact they delete my post explaining how to properly execute a gamma squeeze on certain reddit and discord communities seems real sketchy to me again thanks,2021-03-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ly4lze/a_class_gamma_squeeze_101/

discussion last week even ihor mentioned it despite you fucks not being able to read his replies to various feedback are below the data short volume today friday th sv his si$ range daily notes oddly slow day as fat call options expire as they were being boughten by the thousands minutes before market closed extremely low long volume retail just holding off market trades bull instituations still carried us possible sizeable shorts were place today ampxb httpspreviewredditvjdignfumpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampscbecebeeafebeb ampxb httpspreviewredditkcbrsegumpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsaadabcacadcf new notes for data its getting to the point where short sellers would litterally need to be of all offmarket and long volume trades to be under i changed the formula for the cost of om volume to match the lowest price of the days as the off market is mainly darkpool trades new conclusions we can conclude that the of volume used for covering is far less than their average of since the th of january as a result of a big ol fomo rally from retail and a bull effort from institutions hogging up that volume therefore it is not crazy to derive that si is over with a cost well over billion $ to do so important notes what i found was a tendency for these short sellers to get cocky and not cover on weeks when you would have expected them to this means some weaks with low sv had huge net gains in shorts this never worked in reverse in the data ampxb httpspreviewredditjfhumpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampscfceedebcb proof that finra data is impossible if you were to take the finra data from the th of january to the th of february you would find that they wouldve needed to cover using of all transfers for the entire month and a half proof it would have been impossible for them to comprise that portion of the covering with the fomo wave and gamma squeeze that was hogging the data at the time this is notable there was a considerable boost in daily volume in that period so you are talking about a minimal cost of billion dollars using my formulas from my previous data that being the bare minimum amount just to lower it to the si they said it was at proof we have not witnessed a loss of billion usd or more from institutions in that time that would have been a net loss btw no bankruptcies were seen either i said above that i noticed that short sellers did not cover when the data suggested they had the opportunity that this trend never reversed a high weekly sv yielded a net gain in short positions proof sv has remained over throughout the th to th period which provides evidence of a net gain in shorts not a complete dip of the si lastly if all this was the way they say it did then proof the stock price would not have dropped during the period if they had covered the data heavily implies that shorts are used and held to stop upwards momentum ampxb his reposnse to feedback ampxb gtshort volume of total volume cant reliably tell you how many new shorts have entered or covered that day because belowa market maker selling you a share that they havent yet matched up with an actual seller but do a few seconds later will get counted as a short position momentarily this apparently can and does happen and gets counted in the short volume meaning exactly no new short positions were taken but the short volume went up anyway i believe this is actually explained on finras website httpswwwfinraorgrulesguidancenoticesinformationnoticehttpswwwfinraorgrulesguidancenoticesinformationnotice on the flip side it does tell you the absolute highest number of short positions that could have been taken that day so new short positions could be anywhere between and the high short volume amount but due to the above as well as shorts entering and the covering in the same day means you cant really gleam anything from it reliably sorry what you are describing would create a net neutral movement on the share price which was not seen more importantly the data i aquired clearly shows that there was a net gain of shorts when compared to the long volume which is where they could have covered day after day after day it is possible but the data says that they have been creating more shares than they can possibly cover even if they were of the long volume everyday which as we know is algos and day traders i look at things from a scientific lens all i aimed to do was to show that it is financially and numerically impossible for si to have lowered since the th of january it was the running assumption that everyone who believed in this had and i provided damning evidence for it being the case ampxb gtthis is not how it works not saying that gme short interest is x or y but literally this is not how it works you really cant use short volume to determine short interest interpreting daily finra short sale reports mods please dont delete 📷 ive seen a lot of posts about finra daily short sale reports and what it means importantly it doesnt mean what you think this isnt fud its just how market making works tldr a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate buy orders and they immediately cover with the next trade high short volume in the finra report actually often reflects net buying this is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless that sounds crazy but thats how market making works finra report is only for off exchange trades dark pools its a myth that dark pools are all institutional your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like citadel virtu etca mm makes money on the spread between buying and selling obviously what happens is your order to buy shares of gme at market gets sent to a dark pool the mm a computer shorts you those shares at $ and then buys those shares back at $ a short of shares is recorded this also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous of shorts every day for a stock that has a m float the mm isnt “going short” gme they short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later so high short volume in the finra report which is only reflecting off exchange trades dark pools does not necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting it often reflects high levels of buying um like we just saw this week repeat that it does also does not reflect exchange trades you dont have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here generally speaking the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true its just not for the reasons you think ampxb i didnt assume you were fud but its a little sus when you open like that hahahahh same as my answer for the last one my data clearly shows that financially and data wise there are more shorts being taken on most days where the only way for them to even be below what they were on the th would be for them to litterally bankrupt themselves in the process what you describe there would have a net neutral effect on the share price share price plummetted as short volume exceeded long volume that is the fact the data disagrees with your rebuttal ampxb gtno this post is misinformation you cannot gauge short interest from short volume because a majority of short volume is closed in seconds i keep telling people this you should really make a wiki or sidebar notice about short volume so much misinformation and misplaced hype because of short volume high short volume does not mean high short interest to be clear i believe short interest is super high for gme but not due to short volume there has been lots of legit dd done on this but focusing on short volume is straight misinformation propagated by people who dont know what theyre talking about ampxb same as the top two maybe try and actually take the time to read my the data i took hours transcribing and making palletable before waving it off and calling me fake news k in conclusion the data proves that si has gone up the only argument ive heard is the they cover instantly one which isnt whats shown in the data at all its litterally the entire point of me showing short volume overflow to show how many more shorts there are compared to longs daily if it were true wed have risen consistently as this theory would have effect on the share price what actually happened is they shorted it to $ ampxb personally as in umoonski s opinion the feedback from you all is excellent and whilst i am still sceptical of the high s and the total accuracy of the derived info i still think it is very valuable in at least showing that reported si is esesntially total horseshit all we really have is s amp finra delayed self reported data telling us si is constantly dropping yet price action does not suppport such a low liquidity stock being covered from over si in january also very weirdly the data goblin himself ihor of s aka the ihorse hes ihors on twitter ffs tweeted yesterday that gme is a on his new squeeze score aka the squeezeometer how this is derived is a secret so its squeeze potential yet si is plumetting at a mere according to himself mhm thus i am still totally convinced that si is gt and this data shows that there is no way it is what is being report by the likes of s or finra is accurate what we are doing here if not proving to you what the magical si number definitely is is showing that si is substantially higher than what reports are claiming i am also certain gme has a significant issue with synthetic shares due to the volume of trading being a significant of the total free float size of m more like m in reality amc a popular meme stock trades at float and most non meme popular stocks trade far far far lower than this in terms of volume float interestingly i did come across this si was at on feb th according to samppglobal you know the guys whos name is in the sampp in an article posted on feb httpswwwspglobalcommarketintelligenceennewsinsightslatestnewsheadlinesshortinterestinusstocksdeclinesinaftermathofgamestopsagadatashowshttpswwwspglobalcommarketintelligenceennewsinsightslatestnewsheadlinesshortinterestinusstocksdeclinesinaftermathofgamestopsagadatashows they later claimed on march nd that si had dropped to in mid february which makes absolutely no sense given price action to as the stock hoves around $ ok then so yeah enjoy your saturday evening

if i didnt include anything important would love some constructive criticism thanks also with that being said i dont know anything about anything im just some guy who read some stuff and compiled it all here i cant tell the future i am not a financial advisor im just an ape like all of you please do your own research humans are known for being wrong and im no expectation im bullish on this stock but it did just go public therefore there isnt a ton of history for how the stock performs this is not financial advice with that said i hope you enjoy and learn something from this coupang inc dd ticker cpng initial bullish info for the apes who cant stand to read more than words talked about and known as the “amazon of south korea” coupang has been the second largest ecommerce ipo since alibaba revenue loss decreasing year after year since ipo jumped more than company was valued at $b back in june and now is valued at around $b with a market cap of b at the time of writing ceos a harvard grad of the dropout just like zuckerberg coupang has the highest market share of koreas ecommerce business improved cash flow by almost a billion dollars in a year similar to amazon in early years with no gaap profitability but massive cash flow coupangs the most used online shopping platform in south korea coupang has continuingly growing branches in food delivery and grocery services coupang has same day and dawn delivery place an order by midnight and get it by am eco friendly packaging customer base has grew by an approximate million from to up more than now for people who want wrinkles in their brain please continue on reading quantitative net revenue for $b up more than from customer base grew approximately million from to total net revenues per active custom increased to approximately $ in from $ in gross profit for $b also up more than from operating loss for $m down from $m in revenue loss decreasing year after year since b m m in november softbanks vision fund invested over $b with a $b valuation which has since been increased to $b use of proceeds net ipo of class a common stock was $ and jumped to $ nice once it was available to trade however the company has stated they will not be taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization financial flexibility and create a public market for their stock net proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including working capital operating expenses and capital expenditures coupang is currently not planning to pay dividends and rather invest in themselves i really like this because they know exactly what and where their assets are and implies they will be heavily reinvesting into those assets in attempts to grow them amazon has and is using the same formula by not paying dividends not focusing on revenue but focusing on growing their brand recognition and customer base their largest asset amazons ttm use of cash graph below which i predict will mirror coupangs in the future again though i dont know anything 📷 profitability on a gaap basis was not positive however from a cash flow basis they generated over m from operations and continue to generate cash flow in order to boost their operations and reinvest in themselves and grow their customer base which continues to be their strongest asset

amazon many of them also have history in the technology and ecommerce sector with a good deal of them having experience founding their own startups such as kiro kyung who is a highly skilled software engineer who started two tech startups before joining coupang qualitative company mission to create a world where customers wonder “how did i ever live without coupang” same day and dawn delivery reducing delivery times to a matter of hours like if amazon had the same promise of pizza companies with min or less delivery people can place orders by pm and receive them by am the next morning with their rocket wow and rocket delivery program similar to amazon prime and also includes groceries customers go to sleep and wake up like its christmas morning with their order right at their door same day delivery is offered for free days a year even the night before christmas if needed customers can order anything from tomatoes to tvs for free next day delivery better than any other delivery ecommerce players in korea of the population mostly in seoul lives within miles of a coupang distribution center operations span over million sq ft across cities effortless returns by tapping a few buttons on the app or website and leaving the item outside for pickup no repackaging no labels no post office trips just leave it outside and any delivery truck nearby will come pick it up within hours much easier than amazon ebay ups fedex etc ecofriendly packaging cuts down the use of cardboard boxes by more than items are delivered in a simple sleeve and sorted into protective bins ecofriendly bags that are completely reusable and replace almost all disposable packaging the reusable bags are picked up by the delivery network for further use trucks leave full of products and rather than coming back empty they arrive with returned packages and the packaging of other orders which are then immediately used once again for another delivery employees work day work weeks instead of the industry standard employees are provided with paid time off and full benefits amazon employees dont even get amazon prime amazon employees also have not reported the best working conditions “people arent the friendliest” “youre expected to work like a machine” “work life balance can be hard” “needs more benefits etc coupang inc will also be granting their frontline workers more than $m worth of stock and will be the first company in korea to make their employees shareholders of suppliers for coupang are also small merchant and business owners with under $m in revenue per year in the pandemic small businesses on coupang saw their sales increase by over coupang now sits as one of the largest employers in korea with employees and plans to invest over $m into building seven new regional fulfillment centers creating a projected additional jobs by dynamic orchestration meaning their technology predicts and assigns the fastest and most efficient path for delivery drivers out of

delivering close to million products per day which is the highest figure seen since the service was launched in march of rocket delivery continues to be the driving force for coupang with people constantly wanting things faster rocket delivery is a promise to customers that they will get their products on time and when they need them coupang play is a streaming platform branch of coupang that is offered to their wow members at no additional cost coupang play is currently available for android users and is expected to be supported by ios systems sometime this year as well as expanding into smart tvs and pcs coupang play has everything from hollywood movies like the spiderman series and “bombshell to popular korean movies and tv shows id name them but i dont think any of us know what they are coupang play also has documentaries educational videos kids shows and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the only streaming service in korea where users are able to watch things like bryan cranstons show “your honor” and cnn stephen kim the head of coupang play is also on record for saying “we are eager to bring content such as coupang play originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers” coupang eats has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in korea which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by coupang coupang eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for rocket delivery and rocket fresh making delivery as fast and efficient as possible coupangs customer centricity continues to be their most important asset as of the population is miles from a distribution center the company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to “pursue operational excellence and innovation” in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have customer base has also grown by an approximate million from to up more than part of coupangs business model states all of this and i would have reworded it but it truly is perfect and i dont think i could have done a better job when i first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company not to mention again that this is very similar to how amazon approached their business in the early years the statement is as follows “we believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term our longterm investments in building a differentiated technologyorchestrated network and customerfacing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale we have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully such as with our ownedinventory selection rocket wow membership rocket fresh and coupang eats among others we will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers we will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our shortterm results” top risks coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth same strategy as amazon so in my eyes not a downside dilution the company has stated that there will be was immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing out of all the evidence from coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow i believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion i believe this dilution is why coupang had a red day on friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out this does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses however i think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding as well as just going public still though it lessens shareholders position and lowers pe which is a measure of profitability but again we know coupang is not focusing on this at the moment all this changes in my eyes is that im going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends i have tried looking around for other reasons why coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south korea but i have yet to find any info if anyone does a link would be greatly appreciated and i will edit with new info tdlr in my opinion based on everything ive read and compiled here i truly think coupang has unlimited potential the company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself its constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with coupang play and rocket fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets their management team looks very promising with backgrounds in amazon uber and a fuck load of computer engineering year after year revenue has been up customer base has been up and operating loss and net loss have been down this company looks very promising in my eyes and i definitely will be investing in coupang in years to come thanks to everyone who stuck through all this again its my first ever dd so hopefully its not too shit i put a lot of effort and research into this and i hope yall gain some insight to this awesome company please let me know if theres anything i shouldve included in this i am hoping to get a lot better at this whole “stonks” thing as you may have noticed i havent given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly simply because im waiting for my next paycheck so i can afford to buy some i currently dont own shares in coupang but you can bet your ass im buying as much as i can the next time i have money to throw at the market wouldnt you want to get into amazon in thanks again onions this is not finacial

m4cka9,GME,-4.15%,gme technicals dd short interest,DD,47,0.92,HomeDepotHank69,221,this will be long apes so please bull with me this is going to be a breakdown of gmes chart from a technical perspective as well as my thoughts on the short interest and where this is all going i would just like to apologize in advance for all of the lines on my charts i am fucking retarded and my smooth brain needs lots of lines but ill try to make it easy to understand technical breakdown on the day chart we can see that gme is going up in a stairstep pattern which is obviously extremely bullish a stairstep pattern is where it rises up consolidates lightly then uses the previous resistance as support for the next stairstep we are currently in a consolidation phase of that stairstep as you can see the red lines that i circled were previously resisstance but are now support this is bullish ampxb httpspreviewredditsacwjztcumpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampseebbcfcdccedcb next and probably one of my favorite things is the fact that on the day we went from all the way down to we had strong support at the level which as i said above was the resistance from the first step which is now our support even better is the fact that our current consolidation is forming a pennant pattern from that support a pennant pattern usually indicates that a stock will continue its trend in this case up this is extremely bullish dare i say apeish the orange lines show the pennant pattern that im talking about and the two circles show the high and low of that pattern lmao also kinda looks like a torpedo cock and balls its important to note that although the chart makes it appear that it will be breaking that pattern soon the pennant could just extend so do not think that its going to break the pattern on monday because though it very well could it could also just continue consolidating ampxb httpspreviewredditqmwcumpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsfecbeafcdadeeca when it finally stops consolidating and breaks this pattern to continue rising the green line above should act as support for our next stair step which would put us at ish for support which is huge for the day chart you can see that a few weeks ago we broke the giant triangle pattern which is how we got into the current bullish movement those lines are yellow ampxb httpspreviewredditgwkocxcumpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsbbbcfbafcaece finally in the chart above i have marked the areas of crucial resistance these are the fat green yellow and red lines i made them those colors because each one that we break is more crucial than the previous one because of the last squeeze what to take away from the chart action we are currently in a consolidation period of a stairstep pattern that has happened because we broke the triangle pattern that we started after the price went down from the last squeeze this is very bullish apeish again i apologize for all the lines im a technical trader and i make a shit ton of support and resistance lines for my smooth brain volume everyone is talking about the squeeze shorts and price action and blah blah but the thing that everyone needs to be talking about is volume volume volume volume the only way that any type of squeeze can happen is volume i know that people dont like the vw comparison and im not comparing them here just using this as an example but the squeeze was only able to happen because of tremendous volume ampxb httpspreviewredditiietzcumpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsadfeaeebcefb as far as gmes current volume we are not there but dont get down on it becuase we will be the only way for shorts to be squeezed is for a major influx of volume to drive the price up significantly forcing them to cover in the previous squeeze volume spiked tremendously and would have continued to increase if brokerages wouldnt have cut off buying the ceo of interactive brokers even said that the price would reach over k if they didnt shut of buying why volume so for gmes volume its plain and simple it needs to increase but i will not that the fact that the price is increasing so much without massive volume is even more bullish apeish but hank how does volume increase excellent question tard brain for gme and most stocks but especially gme catalysts are what drives volume up below is a picture of gmes volume since the january action ampxb httpspreviewredditrcucldumpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsdfcbafbdfbcdbffca the first spike in volume was in late november when ryan cohen announced his stake but the jump wasnt super significant the first big spike that you can see is on january ish when they announced that ryan cohen was being added to the board in the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention the next jump in volume lots of red is when andrew left of shitron had his weeklong downsyndrome tantrum about gme and get his cheeks clapped by wsb this giant volume orgy is continued for the next few days when elon tweets gamestonk chamath buys a bunch of calls and other celebrities like mark cuban voice their support we then see volume teeter off because of the brokerage cucks ass ramming us the next spike in volume corresponds to when gme ousted their cfo many thought that ryan cohen led this we then see volume decrease a little volume the picks back up when gme announces that it has appointed cohen as the head of their committee on changing gme to a digital company volume has since gone down a little but the price has gone up erection what to take from this plain and simple volume is king volume is your wifes boyfriends wifes boyfriends bosss wifes boyfriend we cannot have another squeeze without volume but volume especially in gmes case is greatly correlated with catalysts volume catalysts here are some potential volume catalysts that could lead to the massive spike that we need gme appointing a new cfo gme appointing ryan cohen as ceo better than expected earnings an acquisition supportinvestment from big names ie cuban elon burry etc new committeesinitiativesanything relating to their digital transformation quadruple witching day march th still not sure how i feel about this and definitely dont think its the be all end all that many others do but it could certainly help overall it appears that the best catalysts are ones dealing with ryan cohen and digital transformation personally i think that if during their earnings call cohen announces hes gonna be ceo or announces some big digital move that will give us the volume we need its important to note that it appears that ryan cohen wants this to happen and why wouldnt he his net worth is tied to it as evident by the tweets that hes put out that though cryptic seem to be implying support of wsb and hatred of shorts roaring kitty has also been very cryptic lately and it appears that he thinks something big is coming too this is just speculation tho im tard ttm squeeze and macd two of my favorite indicators are macd and ttm squeeze i dont wanna explain them here because i only have so many chromosomes available to me each day but they essentially indicate momentum on my charts i combine the macd lines with the ttm squeeze because they move similarly and i think that ttm is superior to macds histogram as you can see on the year chart the macd is in a very bullish pattern right now what im more excited about is the ttm squeeze the colorful bars in a ttm squeeze indicator the light blue lines indicate that the price has extremely bullish momentum its in relation to bollinger bands and keltner channels when the bars turn dark blue there is still bullish momentum but its fading the red bars indicate bearish momentum and the yellow bars indicate fading bearish momentum as you can see are currently in some very strong light blue bars for a ttm squeeze there are usually light blue bars in an extremely bullish pattern from the last squeeze you can see that there are like really tiny light blue bars and then like bigger ones this indicates that we are currently in the middle ofapproaching giant price action but also that the current price action is better than last time and is forming a more stable high arching uptrend if youre thinking oh man unlce hank weve already had light blue bars the squeeze is almost over not so fast tard though i said that theres usually of these bars in an uptrend thats not always the case and going to dark blue bars simply may mean that we are consolidating and will go back to light blue bars overall all this should show you is that yes we are in a bullish trend and things are looking perfect this is one of my favorite indicators and i believe that its giving us insanely good signs ampxb httpspreviewredditjopywldumpngwidthampformatpngampautowebpampsaccbcfceaffacfbfece a note about squeezes let me be clear if the brokerages wouldnt have cut off buying this would have gone up past $ ib ceo said this and hes a boomercuck because of this last time was not a short squeeze it was a gamma squeeze or a series of them a short squeeze would have resulted in a parabolic move to the upside accompanied by a parabolic jump in volume both the price and volume would look like very tall and skinny triangles see the volkswagen pattern for this a short squeeze does not happen over time it happens suddenly and very violently to the upside gamma squeezes on the other hand can happen over a period of time and can happen in small or big chunks its important to note that gamma squeezes can cause short squeezes and short squeezes can exacerbate game squeezes its a feedback loop which is why its so dangerous so currently i think that we are in the middle of a series of gamma squeezes that could lead to a short squeeze if there is a catalyst that creates volume shorts a lot of numbers have been floating around about short interest some say its and well above ive even seen imo its impossible to know right now finras release said it was about and thats the one that i believe to be the most likely definitely dont believe finras assplay however its important to note that those numbers very well could be correct the reason for this is because they cant take into consideration naked shorts if you dont know about this there are s of dds about it so imo there are scenarios here its literally just ish short interest on gme let me be clear this is still huge anything above is huge so is still amazing and has massive short squeeze potential for gme its actually above if the latter is true then the squeeze will happen and will also probably crash the financial system because as we know from when institutions get into these shady unregulated derivative bets on volatile things it usually creates a collateral effect personally i have no clue which one is correct the latter obviously sounds like a conspiracy but could very well be true because we all know how shady these funds are however it begs the question why are they still doing this the answer to this is they are either retarded and not in a good way doing it out of anger and spite and we all know how well emotional trading goes or they are in a bind and cant get out of it personally i think that the conspiracy about naked shorts and everything is either extremely false or extremely true if its extremely true then hfs are just kicking the can down the road hoping that we lose interest and the price decreases if its false then we still have short interest apes and daddy cohen tldr on this paragraph short numbers are conflicting and its impossible to know which is correct or if the naked short theory is true either way i like the stock closing thots the most important thing as i said is fucking volume this is not just gonna magically happen sure the price could very well keep increasing over the coming daysweeks on low volume and small gamma squeezes could happen but until we get a surge in volume through a catalyst we are not going to see the short squeeze remember the squeeze has not squoze until there is a parabolic move in price and volume over a very short period of time im talking trading getting halted times in a single day on the upside do i think that these next few weeks are going to be very important yes especially next week and earnings week but do i think its over if not fuck no so with that being said please try to avoid talking about dates as a certainty because it could lead to some of the younger tards selling because theyre disappointed make sure to do what rensole does and say that it could happen that its a possibility not that its the endgame or a certainty finally continued talk about gme

overnight it always gives me the hangover of loss it always ends the same my account is in disarray i feel a sense of hopelessness and everything in my life id worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like stimulus checks set to arrive but this timethis time it really could be different the fomc is coming up this week starting march th for the unitiated this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on the fed gives their guidance in matters including—but not limited toquantitive easing interest rate speculation and bond yield curve controlhttpswwwgooglecomampsthinkingcomamparticleuswhattowatchatthemarchfedmeeting market volatility precedes it as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa pow might or might not say or do—if the man farted into the microphone and walked away vxx would probably climb the tension is palpable this one couldnt come at a more precarious time as good news is now bad news as reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus people are beginning to stop taking jpow at his word he promises a steady hand he promises no interest rate increases he says bond yield curve control is always on the tableand yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll you see the problem with the fed right now is no matter what they say investors see the inevitable trend theyre betting there is only so long the fed can continue to artificially support the marketand only so long there will be reason to as indexes roar the actual economy improves and vaccine distribution is for the most part on track to return us to a world of pseudonormalcy by summer it doesnt help that the fed stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on yield curves definitively during speaking engagements and quietly ended the term repo m lending programhttpswwwbloombergcomnewsarticlesfedendingtermreposreflectsliquidityfeastfordealers my choice here is between treasurytickers and the vxx last time i was making this choice i went with vxx on the dd and that choice didnt pan out until the second week i said then reflecting on that weeks losers that i should have chosen treasuriesso why didnt i this time with the opportunity right here vxx is just absurdly low right now trading under $ im not saying the pop will happen tuesday or wednesday but it may and dollars to donuts if you hold a vxx or c youll make some money at some point if you dont hold too long after it makes a run also if jerome breathes a word about yield control they will plummett this intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low—there is too much potential for chop sure i could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting peoples accounts and that argument is fair as i see some of the new age commodities mooning to ath over the wekend but for the most part id rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks dont come back burning me but anyway you didnt come here for my halfbaked philosophy on impending market

though 😅 last weeks lesson ge and dis were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on monday then they hit us with that nasty curve news broke that ge was closing a huge deal on sunday which gave me continued optimism and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse splitif you say you saw that coming yous a damn lie dis got great news but it was crossing a key resistance number is that ta i dont know man i think so and couldnt hold i think the key here is its okay to take a pause on the pick if its hot fresh out the gate the week of the rambo there will be more picks the other lesson here is that when the event is big enough it plays like an earnings rather than a pump dkng for example had pump written all over it it was more about future

around this event is that this is moment nok needs to do something to please investors nok is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts the key pump factor here is whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policythats what im watching for if we get the dividend announcement the sky is the limit if we dont well bail out quickly because this sinking ship may head

m4j5s5,None,N/A,how the united states government could benefit from meme stocks going to the moon,Discussion,20,0.89,fortifier22,21,disclaimer none of this is financial advise or based on facts this is simply educational and theoretical discussion tldr capital gains tax easing and even erasing debt financial stimulus to peoples all over the world a happier and more compliant population tax dodgers and those who screwed over the world in brought to justice in the only way that matters and a much needed stock market correction that could prevent a future disaster we all know that many meme stocks theoretically have the potential to explode through short and gamma squeezes and that will make many shareholders on the long side a lot of money however when looking at the bigger picture there is a lot that the government could gain from such events that can help them and the country in a long run lets take a look at the aftermath of meme stocks mooning capital gains tax when people sell their meme stock shares after short squeezes occur governments will attain taxes off these investments considering that millions of shares will be traded frequently for large sums of money that will bring some much needed stimulus to the economy this is especially considering how of americas money has been printed in the last year due to covid instead of raising taxes on the american people and having them pay more for their own money in the long run the capital gains taxes from these stocks can potentially make that unnecessary also with more money gained from stocks many will likely reinvest some or even most of their money back into the stock market leading to even more capital gains taxes being reaped people being more willing and able to spend further stimulating the economy and creating a happier population its no surprise that when times are tougher economically people tend to spend less and save more yet because this leads to governments reaping less taxes and businesses not being as profitable this makes economic times rougher which in turn leads to a potentially endless economic recessiondepression weve seen this in japan in the late s and early s and they are currently at economic levels that are equal to their status in theyve gone backwards in terms of their financial progression with the general population in possession of large sums of money however this allows the economy to be stimulated which not only benefits many people from nearly all classes but also creates a happier population overall imagine it after a year of prolonged quarantine job loss future inflation and economic instability all while billionaires and institutions are playing the system and becoming even more rich for their own sakes suddenly get served justice then their money gets divided among those who took the most risks and played against them fought the fight to the end and helped make the world a better place this is practically the script to endgame heck most actionheroic movies and the american people get to be a part of it speaking of bad guys the gains also wont be in the hands of large tax dodgers we all know that tax dodging is practiced by many especially those in large positions of power and wealth so is it truly wrong to reasonably assume that many big wall street players are dodging taxes for the us government this means that a lot of money that should and could be going towards erasing national debt fortifying infrastructure improving medical and educational institutions and many more benefits for americans overall is instead being kept away for the sake of keeping rich individuals bank accounts filled with zeros with the money in the hands of the average citizen however the vast majority will not be able to commit tax fraud if at all on a massive level of course they wont go out quietly when the squeezes happen yet that can still be a good thing because the stock market needs a correction many have been speculating that the stock market is not accurately reflecting the american economy and that a correction is inevitable when the squeezes happen for meme stocks however after the new dtcc rule comes into effect that will force hedge funds to liquidate much of their assets to cover their positions theyll likely sell their other shares in massive volumes causing huge dips to occur in many stocks across the stock market yet once the dust settles people can finally reassess the markets and determine where everything should be stocks that deserve to be higher will be on huge discounts for many investors to get in on and allow them to go back up again while those that deserve to be down will likely stay down then the economy can become stabilized again and everything can continue as it should whether all of this is correct or not is beyond me and only based on the information i currently know theres far more that could and could not happen based on ifwhen meme stocks skyrocket and force many shorters and market makers to buy stocks at higher prices but most importantly i wanted to start a potential discussion on the aftermath of meme stocks going to the moon and allow others to also and and correct my statements as well as share this info with the overall community so what do you

rebuttals they sell mostly their own products ok theyve got strong customer loyalty can they expand their business to incorporate more rd party sellers in the future potential is there low gross profit margin retail has always historically been a low profit margin business is it possible for them to introduce a new high margin product or service absolutely still cash flow negative did you see the revenue growth $b to $b in one year theyre a growth company in its early stages i also mentioned above how theyre investing s of millions into their infrastructure distribution centers within miles of of population they dont have aws its not a literal copy of amazon they are also growing their ecommerce business before focusing on anything else sales went from $b to $b in one year they need to saturate this market before focusing on anything else its highly likely they will introduce new high profit product or service in the coming years their founder is a harvard drop out they dominate only in south korea whats wrong with that even with the south korean ecommerce market alone $cpng can become a $b company they are focused on dominating their immediate market im sure theyll create new services and create new sources of revenue once the korean market is saturated theyll figure out a way to expand these south koreans are smart and good at tech dont underestimate them valuation price target if in $cpng has a market share they will have $b in sales amazon has market share of us in with a conservative ps of that puts $cpng fair value at $ per share $b sales x $b valuation if they are doing well and they have hype with a ps of baba has cpang has then $cpng should be $ per share $b x $b valuation and this is if they dont create any new products or services think about that no new products or services just purely their ecommerce business and its still going to be worth $ per share if they launch an awslike thing or maybe another service thats just waiting to be discovered theyre going to do an additional $b easy with the market share they have so add another $ to the price targets as one of the technologically most advanced countries in the world $cpng is not here to stay its here to takeover south korea conclusion my thesis is heavily dependent on them expanding their business with new high margin productsservices but this is a bet i am willing to make harvard drop out softbank blackrock bill ackman one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world etc i guarantee they will innovate oh and even if its not them developing something internally they can always acquire a company theyre going to do billions in profits soon that is a lot of money its under $ today with an $b valuation its literally free

m5wglc,GME,-27.72%,gme trading strategy to catalyze the squeeze,DD,21,0.96,AJDillonsMiddleLeg,290,i made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on gme and several people asked that i turn that comment into a post so here it is obviously im going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze first the comment as it was ive seen lots of bullish ta on gme keep in mind all ta requires volume to play out how it should we havent had any volume on gme in over a week holding shares simply isnt enough needs constant all day every single day buying of shares and in the money options if you buy options that are in the money they literally cant price pin because they cant get and keep the price below current market so you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge and virtually eliminate their means of counterattack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain price at which most contracts expire worthless if you are intending to help push the squeeze buy shares throughout the day every day if you are playing options mostly buy calls in the money if youre buying otm calls buy as close to current price as you can afford the more imbalanced otm calls are the more theyre just going to price pin at maximum pain they literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new itm call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge essentially we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with gamestop there are two major reasons manipulation we cannot do anything about this really aside from buy and hold technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels the shorts while stuck in a stupid position arent stupid they know when the ta is indicating a bullish setup and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup volume all technical setups require volume to play out if volume doesnt follow the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable except in this case it goes down because its being shorted at every chance so what do we need to do hold yes but that cant be it if we are doing nothing but holding this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient they can literally hold us in a stalemate for monthsyears if volume never shows up to move the price yes they pay more interest the longer they have to wait theyll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the sec steps in to stop market manipulation volume without volume there is no endgame look at every day weve had spikes look at the volume now look at the past week or two we arent making progress because nobody is buying shares aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks believe it or not the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze the whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time if it catches on they can follow it up but if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail this thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days if you look at any day there are surges in buy volume but theyre short thats likely a whale testing the market if they see confirmationfollowup from the market its less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure so it will be something like whale buy retail confirmation buys whale buy runaway effect gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze all of those things have to happen consecutively fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack now this is going to sound counterintuitive but in order to catalyze the squeeze we have to stop just buying the dip when volume picks up and the price is spiking thats the most important time to buy thats the point when additional buying pressure is most important and until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes we are going to keep bouncing back and forth options the other side of the coin is options purchases stop devoting the majority of your capital to far otm lotto tickets this helps the short positions because it forces the market makers to help the shorts market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk when you buy an $c it does two things they dont have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral in incentivizes the market makers to pin the price you can do some additional reading on max pain price in options but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless when you buy otm call options youre increasing the maximum pain price which makes it easier for market makers and shorts to pin the price there if however youre buying a ton of itm call options youre doing two things deep itm calls have a delta of essentially this means that in order to remain risk neutral the market makers essentially has to buy shares immediately upon selling you the contract it lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most oi this means in order to pin the price at max pain they would need to drop it from its current price not only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately meaning they dont care where the price goes you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price if you must buy otm calls buy ones that are at least closer to being itm the further otm you buy calls the more likely the price will go sideways you can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases once it achieves a runaway squeeze which will be easy to identify you can start buying your lotto tickets tldr in my opinion if you want to help catalyze the squeeze you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least in the money 💎🙌🚀🌖,2021-03-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5wglc/gme_trading_strategy_to_catalyze_the_squeeze/

mkal7x,A,7.84%,the uranium bull thesis is playing out to perfection a $bn market is emerging a multiyear run for the equities is inevitable,DD,29,0.84,BooOnClay,218,with so many exciting developments of late i wanted to share my on the current state of the uranium market focusing a bit on swu which i am very fond of haha as always i look forward to any feedback as am sure all are aware we have seen a jump in spot over last weeks while the increase was in large part to nonproducing mines physical purchasing i noticed a number of discussions on reddit and various discord servers stocktwits also seeming to suggest that this uptick in spot u was indicative of where we are in the current fuel cycle experienced investors in this sector will tell you however that this couldnt be further from the truth rather a more powerful indicator as to where we are in the cycle is by looking at the swu enrichment price based in large part on swu projections many expert investors are forecasting a $bn market for perspective during the last cycle the market peaked at $bn so what is swu for those very new to uranium investing a very quick overview might be helpful also for those more familiar than i am i appreciate the feedback swu short for separative work unit is a measure for the cost of enrichment generally speaking when swu prices are low utilities benefit by purchasing excess enrichment inventory at cheap prices using intermediaries ie carry trades conversely a rise in swu signifies that the demand for enrichment is growing as excess inventories are utilized by end users the utilities no longer aided by the secondary market instead turn to the uranium producers to purchase future contracts at much higher prices it follows logically that higher enrichment prices force the utilities to retreat back into the fuel cycle from conversion uf and even fabricated fuel purchasing to the beginning ie spot u which in turn drives those spot prices up additionally and perhaps most importantly higher swu prices on future contracts are essential in incentivizing the mines to come back online mcarthur and cigar lake for example need at least the $s and for paladin likely in the $s in order to justify their operational costs therefore swu is arguably the best indicator of where we are in the fuel cycle even when there are false startsspikes in the market which weve seen in the past couple years swu price is consistent what is the current swu price swu bottomed out at $ in august after so much excess accumulated in the years following fukushima since hitting that low swu has been on a relative straight line upwards currently estimated at $ this steady growth over the past years is one of if not the most compelling reason investors are so confident of a long bull market to come in this sector so how the is swu forecasting a $bn market of course there are a number of things we can look at that are driving this thing its becoming almost a daily occurrence now to see catalysts emerging ie breaking news this week on eu green energy qualifications the white house endorsing nuclear in as part of the clean energy standard however moreso than anything swu is at the core of the bull thesis which is that decarbonization of the electrical grid around the world is not possible without nuclear power duke energy corp just said the same yesterday as swu prices continue to rise it is inevitable that equity prices will follow denison is a fun example even now im still amazed at how many people claiming to have thousands of shares of certain uranium producers are surprised when they hear that denison isnt actually producing any uranium when utilities start executing term contracts with other producers at swu in the $s $s $s and beyond those mines will turn the lights back on the fact that they just bought spot above market is a pretty powerful indication of where things are headed as far as volume on these long term contracts it wont be long before denisons prices start to rise the same idea goes with cominak ranger etc moreover what happens when weve exhausted cigar lake and kazatomprom or mcarthur river it isnt just that we have a rising demand we need new projects coming into existence now in order to avoid a huge deficit in supply between the investment opportunities on these projects are extremely exciting and why $bn frankly i think $bn is conservative though something in this vicinity i have seen as the consensus among many experts market cap for publicly traded uranium is at bn right now and this is only the very beginning ultimately there are new players in the game with a ton of liquidity ie hedge funds and they are looking for value taking $urnm as one example the aum just months ago when it ipod was a few million now aum is $mm we also cannot ignore what is happening in china it is a huge growth story there there is also a spec frenzy but again looking at the big picture moreso than anything else i keep going back to swu for me it is the most powerful predictor of the multiyear bull run to come and while there will always be doubtful retail who to their credit have rightfully called false starts over the last couple years you cannot deny what years of rising swu enrichment prices means for where we are in the current cycle again i would be very interested to hear where folks agreedisagree any and all feedback is
