to 29th we still have 55 million shorts that were executed those two weeks and in the finra exchanges we can see the155 million short volume but howwhere do they do this offexchange trade you might ask right on your damn phone urist mcpaperhands for market makers with a customer order to sell they will temporarily sell short which gets published to the tape as a media transaction for public dissemination and then immediately buy from their customer in a nonmedia transaction that is not publicly disseminated to avoid double counting share volumes  otcmarketscomhttpsblogotcmarketscom20181113understandingshortsaleactivity if you sold gme via any of those apps chances are they bought up those shares themselves after they used them to cover their shorts the rest of the shorts are just in the ether of otc exchanges granted i cant get data for how many of the shorts were fully executed how many started to juggle around with options but we do know that before tonight the si was above 200 and has been updated to 78 i believe that the update is referring to data at the end of january correct me in comments tldr 1 nyse sees only 15 the volume

lgxvh9,spce,-47.13%,virgin galactic $spce,discussion,112,0.84,njitsbe,178,dear wallstreetbets ampx200b today i want to talk about virgin galactic and the potential the company has space travel is vastly developing and together with the ev business this will be the future chamath helped virgin galactic in the process to go public recently cathie announced that she will create a space etf arkq has been buying a lot of shares over the last few months recently arkq sold some shares but i would consider it normal since the stock is up by 140 since september i would assume arkq took some profits and reinvested them in other companies i would like to take a look at the business model of the company many bears are saying that the business wont be profitable because of the high cost of the tickets estimates are that the price for one ticket will be around 250000 dollars so their customers would have to be millionaires in order to be able to pay for it only 1 of the population is a millionaire so you would assume it wont be very profitable in the long run but lets take a look at the history of flying in its early years flying was very expensive and only a luxury for the rich back in 1941 the cost to travel from boston to los angeles was $453924 in 2015 this only costs $48089 source httpswwwtravelandleisurecomairlinesairportshistoryofflightcostshttpswwwtravelandleisurecomairlinesairportshistoryofflightcosts space travel might have a similar trend regarding the price of the tickets only the rich will be able to afford a ticket to space in the beginning but as technology improves the business costs will be reduced but space travel is not their only catalyst they are looking into supersonic flights they made a deal with rollsroyce regarding this subject heres an article for those who are interested httpswwwvirgingalacticcomarticlesvirgingalacticunveilsmach3aircraftdesignforhighspeedtravelandsignsmemorandumofunderstandingwithrollsroycehttpswwwvirgingalacticcomarticlesvirgingalacticunveilsmach3aircraftdesignforhighspeedtravelandsignsmemorandumofunderstandingwithrollsroyce i want to talk about the short interest the short percent of float is currently 7195 in november the short percent reached its peak at 893 since then some shorts have been covering their positions as many catalysts are being released but with a successful flight to space the stock price might surge and more shorts might give up on their position i just want to point you out the stock price in november was $2661 currently the stock trades at $5671 to be honest they might be sweating right now source httpswwwmarketbeatcomstocksnysespceshortinteresthttpswwwmarketbeatcomstocksnysespceshortinterest okay i will finish this dd with a list of catalysts which are coming this saturday virgin galactic will open the flight window this does not mean they will fly the saturday but it will happen within the next few days there was an unsuccessful flight back in december but what some people might not understand is the amount of safety procedures a company has to take spacex for example are shooting up many rockets each year but there are no passengers so when a rocket explodes many people would be fascinated by the explosion but imagine if a rocket with 3 people exploded thats why it is so much harder for virgin galactic to have a successful flight i live in belgium and i was watching the news here back in december the news reported about the failed flight of virgin galactic i didnt expect this at all but imagine if they have a successful flight the news would spread around the world after the successful flight richard branson will go to space later this year it was scheduled in q1q2 of 2021 but it got pushed back due to the failed test in december they are expecting to have their first commercial space flight in 2021 cathie will launch her space etf i think this stock has a lot of potential and a successful flight will launch this stock virgin galactic will literally bring us closer to the moon i hope you enjoyed my dd and if i missed something please let me know in the comments,2021-02-10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgxvh9/virgin_galactic_spce/
lgy6fl,cnk,14.93%,dd cinemark $cnk – clear standout in “moon stock” screen🚀🚀🚀,dd,44,0.72,coznova77,89,first time poster longtime tard gme was too beautiful to remain a passive reader sure lob your “hf shill” comments bring it retards but then hear me out if you like $$$$ …can’t be sure with half you guys… the perfect stock has been right in front of your eyes and it’s so obvious it hurts amc’s ugly sister cnk is strapped to an elon musk rocket and is just begging for someone to press the big shiny launch button this is a rare onetwo punch where both the technical amp fundamental pictures look great punchline upfront cnk currently trades at $20 cnk has upside to $40 these are levels at which it traded only 18 months ago in fact cnk traded in a $10 range between $32 and $42 in 2019 with an average price of $3780  technical the ice cream the tendie ok… why cnk simple i ran a “moon screen” which looked for  1 high short interest gt20 of floatable shares outstanding 2 cheap stock hasn’t had a “gme moment” low 1 year return fundamentals etc 3 small company with lower trading volume both mean more upside 4 liquid ie a lot call options fuck puts to minimize trading costs ie maximize tendies  and cnk got spit out as the clear standout if this feels familiar it’s because most of these criteria were based off gme before cohen was announced to the board that’s right i simply want to acknowledge the salivating technical set up and it’s similarity to gme preorbit  fundamental the cherry on top the tendie sauce covid has changed the world in lasting meaningful ways and cnk’s theatre footprint is uniquely positioned to benefit from these changes pentup demand for outofhome entertainment combined with a backlog of strong film content creates a strong backdrop for cinemark ampx200b reason 1 suburban lowerincome tilt will outperform in postcovid world tldr suburban footprint actually really fucking good for many reasons cinemark’s theatre footprint is slated toward suburban locations don’t take my word for it here is their coocfo sean gamble really his name lol “cnk tends to be more suburban while amc’s circuit tends to be a bit more metro” this is what gets me excited while we still don’t fully know the extent covid had on people living in dense urban areas like nyc the preliminary read is that it has accelerated the move to the suburbs this helps cnk for two reasons 1 suburban locations have lower rent 2 suburban locations stand to benefit from higher demand based off people moving to the suburbs just think for a second on average suburbs have less fun shit to do although going to the movies might not sound that exciting in a city given all the great alternatives going to the movies might be “the only game in town” in suburbia in addition cinemark operates primarily in smaller cities and suburban areas meaning lowerincome where customers are more pricesensitive cinemark’s customer base also has a higher share of families than amcregal this also helps cnk 1 more price sensitive customers gt less ability to create a compelling movie experience at home gt more likely to continue going to the theater reason 2 better balance sheet gt longer runway to weather “covid storm” tldr lots money low debt low rent i can wait out covid strong balance sheet 850mm in cash sitting there low leverage of 2x3x vs amc at 85x  industryleading operations with fat margins 2326 domestic margins 86 “fatter” ie good fat margin fat tendie than amc low rent obligations newupdated theaters nice operational runway to weather the covid storm reason 3 boost from dollar weakness 25 of revs from latin america huge fx headwind here if dollar depreciates which many people think  ampx200b valuationnerd shit has traded historically at 6585x fwd ebitda conservatively take low end of range due to sentiment around streaming killing box office sales despite still trading at 85x as recently as a few years ago  fullyear 2021 revs will be 50 but by 2022 revs should be back to 2019 precovid levels so using 2022 lvls is the right forward base to value this thing ebitda was 750mm in 2019 50mm haircut for potential covid hiccups puts me at 700mm estimate for 2022 again the first “normal” year given 2021 is already off to shit start taking the lowend of the valuation multiple 65x gives me a price of $3850 after dividing by shares outstanding target price $3850 ampx200b afterthought – takeout upside streaming service amzn nflx dis bundling subscriptions with theatre access might serve as a competitive differentiator as the content wars get increasingly competitive as nearly a dozen streaming services compete for market share might snatching up a cinema on the cheap offer an edge via a differentiated experience tack on just as restaurants won’t go away despite everyone having a kitchen theatres could still have a role although a changed one that will have to become experiencefirst moviesecond as long as dates esp highschool and nights out still happen having an extra avenue to watch movies besides your couch will still have some demand a physical footprint for amzn to test vr and reinforce other ecommerce services ampx200b noteslinks sean gamble chief operating officer and chief financial officer gtand in terms of our overlap it really varies based on the market and just what you consider overlap based on distance in general its pretty small i would say estimate less than 20 you just consider our market shares that can kind of show that its only a small portion in we generally tend to be more suburban while their circuit tends to be a bit more metro so its a limited overlap cnk breaks higher after 20

lh1kju,wkhs,-67.63%,wkhs usps contract,dd,54,0.81,munchmacooch,253,bluf i am long wkhs and believe americanmade ev should be the new usps mail truck long time commenter first time dd’er and i am not sorry about my lack of emoji inclusion in this dd this is for pure autistinal personnel this is my take on a lot of dd going around wkhs this is not an explanation of a possible short squeeze or how we will ‘stick to the hfs’ fuck that i’m just trying to pass along my ideas and share them with y’all to get rich if you like them great if you don’t great but also fuck this is also not technical analysis i can make another post with my cup and handle patterns and bull flags showing up everyday indicating bullish trends but i really believe that you cannot use ta to predict the usps sources for technicals are at the bottom wkhs price in the short term is almost entirely dependent on the usps contract they the usps have been pushing back and pushing back the deadline to make the announcement on who gets usps’s $6bb contract and hopefully we are approaching the finish line based off a board of governor’s meeting that occurred this week publicly there is no breakout candidate but wkhs is one of three but most likely one of two remaining companies to replace the usps fleet 165000 vehicles the other finalist oshkosh is teaming up with ford but their submission is still an ice which does not meet the request and intent of the president’s zeroemission initiative let’s pause and talk about biden and the usps for a second and i’ll put it in bullet form so you morons skip to this part immediately biden wants to electrify the entire us government fleet biden wants to the fleet to be 100 american made vehicles f is not 100 american made something like only 64 and even less for their future ev oskf’s submission is an ice they are planning ev but it was not their submission to the usps contract bid wkhs is 100 manufactured in the usa wkhs specializes in ev delivery vehicles and already has partnerships with all major delivery players wkhs has patents and improvements to ‘lastmile’ delivery but even with all that info some may still push for an oskf vehicle since they already have solid partnerships with the federal government let’s talk about that osk has a relationship with the military to make humvee’s and other huge gas guzzling trucks for military purposes but this relationship is with the federal govt and will not influence the usps decision the usps is an independent agency under the executive branch of the government who is in charge of that branch exactly that is why trump had so much influence over the last 4 years in the usps and votebymail but not the time for this discussion the usps is also a forprofit agency and receives no direct taxpayer funding but continues to operate at a loss the usps spent $7062mm maintaining their fleet of shitty ice clunkers in fy2019 short of elon musk going out and mailing his entire fortune in nickels to the iss via first class mail what better way to reduce cost and increasing revenue than by going completely ev the usps must reduce cost and improve technology chain to remain competitive ice repair and maintenance cost per mile $0028 ev repair and maintenance cost per mile $0012 total savings per vehicle for lifetime by using ev $4600 the usps is run by a board of governors who in turn elect a postmaster general they operate like any board of directors and must answer to deficits and losses it is imperative for the usps to remain up to date on emerging technologies to reduce cost of delivery which brings us to another point last mile delivery last mile delivery accounts for more than 53 of total shipping cost last mile delivery is the distribution center to your doorstep literally where usps operates it costs $1010 to deliver a package to your door but usps is charging $808 so they are already operating a loss why is this so expensive 1 lower average speed more time on the road fewer mpg 2 more stops leads to more idling and more downtime 3 my neighborhood mailman always parks her truck at the bottom of the hill and hikes up “to get exercise” way more time for delivery the first two of these issues are solved with wkhs wkhs ev will reduce mpg cost duh but their final mile drone delivery and automated solutions will reduce the need for more stops and increase productivity chain seriously look up the workhorse horsefly the third issue i will not argue and fully support her getting in better shape with all this being said it’s obvious that i feel that wkhs is the obvious choice but who knows what the board of governors is thinking below are the 4 scenarios for end game that a user came up with on tradingview but they are pretty standard scenario one 40 chance wkhs earns the entire contract someone else did the math of the fair stock price after adjusting for the additional billions of dollars wkhs would have from winning the contract and they came out with $172 per share right after the contract was announced scenario two 30 change the contract is split up between oskosh and workhorse in the initial documentation before bidens 100 green energy plans the usps wanted 75 electric 25 gas vehicles so it is possible workhorse gets 75 and oskosh gets 25 others on the internet claim that it will be all or nothing but if you check the actual agreement it gives room for a split which the government does all the time even with only 10 of the contract awarded to wkhs you can expect to see the stock break past $60 the very next day scenario three 20 chance they can’t come to a decision and push it back until next quarter this has happened already two times they were first supposed to decide this summer but they pushed it back to december in december they failed again and pushed it back to latest march 31st if this happens the pullback to about $20 is super likely or at least holding the lower fibonacci retracement scenario four 10 chance osk wins the contract oskosh is an awesome company they have a very positive relationship with the government selling us humvees for the military they are respected and reliable however they submitted a fossil fuel powered prototype and due to contract law cant just resubmit something else at the last minute especially with biden wanting to look like he can get shit done and after having made a statement about electrifying the us fleet it looks insanely unlikely that osk gets the entire bid but if this happens the only support that wont get destroyed the very next day is at the $16 level tldr wkhs should win the usps contract and their short term viability relies on it my positions 600 shares at $34 cost basis $32c leaps 12022 $32c’s at 212 219 319 total position is worth

lh3z6b,none,n/a,another boring educational post for the new traders,discussion,430,0.95,utubewhitmantrading,559,in my last education post many of you told me that you had no idea where to get started with trading so i thought i would make another boring educational post for the millions of new traders who recently joined our community this will show you the best tutorials and tools you need to get started trading stocks and options even though i am a decent fulltime trader i am not a grammar expert so if you have any questions please comment them below and i will try and get back to them before we start please understand you should treat trading as a job because if you do it right it will be your only source of income in a year or two if you put in the effort and master your emotions list of apps videos and tools worth using 1 mobile traders brokers feel free to offer your thoughts on these in the comments 1 webull 2 dough 3 think or swim 4 etrade 5 tasty trade 6 schwab 2 option flow data see what options hedge funds are buying 1 titanflow httpstitanflowiohttpstitanflowio best for mobile traders 2 flowalgo httpsflowalgocomhttpsflowalgocom best for experienced traders with over 20k 3 youtube videos to watch in order i can only provide video names because the links got my last post removed 1 the ultimate stock trading course for beginners 2 technical analysis secrets what most trading gurus will never tell you 3 options trading for beginners the ultimate indepth guide 4 stock market order types market order limit order stop loss stop limit 5 3 common psychological trading mistakes 6 how to build a profitable trading plan i assume most of you already have a broker you prefer but in case you do not i have listed a few good ones above what i like to tell new traders is to drop a small amount of money into your account something like $20$50 that you are willing to lose play around on the app and buy a few stocks nooooo optionssss and get a feel for your app or platform after you have some fun making your first few trades head over to youtube and watch the videos i listed above treat these videos as a class and bring a notebook to write down any notes you think are important or any questions you may have after each video go over your notes and ask questions in one of the many trading communities here on reddit then go back to your app or platform and test out what you have learned while again taking notes of things you notice after you do this proceed to the next video after you have watched the technical analysis video practice using your own technical analysis by visiting the trading view website if you have think or swim by td ameritrade etrade or another broker who has a platform for desktops you can do it straight from there which can be a huge bonus after you have watched the first two videos then you can bring your total account up to $100 you will continue to practice trading using the skills you have learned so far you may make some profit or you may end up losing a few bucks its important to understand how your emotions are guiding your trading decisions every time before you hit the buy button you should ask yourself “should i really buy this” if you can’t answer that question then under no circumstances should you be making that trade if you want to get started in options you can watch the third video but understand that while options can have amazing returns they also come with great risk the video is 3 hours long so grab a snack and find a quiet spot where you can’t be bothered that option video blew my mind and is one of the main reasons i am able to trade full time that video covers everything so i do not need to go more indepth here on options trading now we come to something that is soooooo important but usually takes traders far too long to understand the order type video will save you so much money because it will help you understand why market orders are usually not the right way to go especially when you are trading large amounts of capital during this whole time you should have been practicing how to trade and you might have wondered what the order types meant when you went to buy a few shares of stock again take notes and practice implementing what you have learned into your evolving trading style the next two videos are a great pair because the first one educates you on the emotional side of trading while the second video helps you learn to trade with a plan if you do not have your emotions under control i can tell you know that you will abandon that plan as soon as you see your account start to lose money you have to get rid of that sinking stomach feeling when the stocks not moving in the direction you want this definitely takes time but if you can mitigate these types of feelings you should have a solid understanding of how to start trading if you have time which most of you won’t i recommend watching all of the tutorials again because you will take different things away from them compared to when you were just starting out doing all of this may take a couple of weeks or a few months if you have a busy work and family life but i encourage to make the effort so you can live the good life always remember why you started trading in the first place if you are just looking for fun or a quick buck you will probably end up losing way more than you ever

ampx200b in every market bubble you always hear the same language the same rationalizations the same absurd arguments these people think they are offering some new unique insight in reality all they offer are the same manic rationalizations that existed in every other bubble market in history lets address the primary two bull rationalizations today before we set into the bear thesis ampx200b 1 interest rates are low nowhere for money to go except stocks when you really drill down into it this is some bizarre logic its essentially saying you are forced to make more risky bets if less risky bets are less profitable in other words its a manifestation of the greedy fomo mindset that occurs precisely during bubbles ultimately these bull arent even arguing that we arent in a bubble they are arguing we are in a bubble but that the bubble is justified the obvious counter is that holding cash is neither impossible nor even undesirable in a lowinterest rate environment whats the worst that can happen if i sit on a pure cash portfolio i lose 2 per year not good of course but not the end of the world either whats the worst that can happen if i dump all my money into stocks at all time highs and the market crashes i lose 50 of my funds in as little as a month ouch the idea that im forced to risk losing a huge percentage of my capital because losing 2 a year is simply impossible to endure is the sort of logic that can only arise under a euphoric bubble mindset of course the premise that these bulls are relying on is that the market simply wont crash or that they will be prescient enough to calmly hop out of the market once a crash becomes obvious but the whole point is that the crash is never obvious especially to permabulls they see a dip and they buy it they see a deeper dip what a great opportunity so they buy more and before they realize the dip isnt simply a dip they are already fucked tale as old as time the funny thing is this argument can be used to justify almost any investment no matter how irrational why hold cash when bonds pay more why buy bonds when index funds pay more why buy index funds when spacs pay more why buy spacs when flipping cocaine pays more after all if you assume that holding cash is simply impossible since it loses to inflation what sort of high risk investment can you not justify whats most interesting is that this argument isnt even new the ridiculously low interest rates set by the fed in the past were precisely what sowed the seeds for the massive housing bubble that led to the 2008 crash the fed is ultimately a bubble creator something even wsb is well aware of 2 if you sit out this rally you will end up behind even if you are right this is perhaps the most popular argument of permabulls they argue that if you sat out the last 10 months something this is essentially a straw man argument except in reference to permabears then you would have missed out on massive gains and therefore the implicit argument is you can never sit out if you carefully analyze this argument you will realize it is literally nothing more than fomo to the extreme its fear of missing out disguised as macroeconomic theory i have to stay in the market perpetually i can never sit out because if i do i will miss out on gains and you better stay in the market with me otherwise you will miss out too dummy first of all i will admit this is a good argument against people who are legitimately permabears people who do sit out a market in fear for months and months do actually miss out on substantial gains but not everyone signalling the warning signs of a bubble are permabears there are clear historical signals of an irrational bubble and those who pay attention to such signals are not missing out they are simply protecting their wealth against irrational greed an intelligent investor is neither a bull nor a bear they adapt to the market and when an intelligent investor adapts and becomes a bear in a raging bull market you can be sure there will be no shortage of bulls attacking them as a stupid permabear the bulls think they will get wise before the crash hurts them but their greed is precisely what will prevent that scenario from playing out ampx200b lets take a look at some of the signs we are in the greatest bubble in history ampx200b major indicators of the great bubble ampx200b 1 massive retail investment worldwide what are some signs of bubbles historically well a sure metric is when you get massive public interest and investment in the market do we have that today check on fucking steroids weve got people who cant change a fucking tire on their 2008 civic downloading robinhood and gambling options on margin like wtf the 80 iq mongoloid who was washing dishes at

now everyone from my grandmother to some farmer in bangladesh is downloading robinhood to buy calls on fucking sndl or whatever the fuck past us market bubbles were largely restricted to the us population it was mostly americans buying american stocks during the dotcom boom but wild irrational bubble speculation has been globalized now almost anybody in the world can dump their hard earned rupees into tesla at a 1300 pe ratio whats that noise is that some greedy billionaire goblin audibly salivating in the distance the max pain theory which is ironically popular among permabulls argues

investopedia since im getting lazy here the greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities whether or not they are overvalued by selling them for a profit at a later date this is because there will always be someone ie a bigger or greater fool who is willing to pay a higher price if acting in accordance with the greater fool theory an investor will purchase questionably priced securities without any regard to their quality if the theory holds the investor will still be able to quickly sell them off to another “greater fool” who could also be hoping to flip them quickly unfortunately speculative bubbles burst eventually leading to a rapid depreciation in share prices the greater fool theory breaks down in other circumstances as well including economic recessions and depressions in 2008 when investors purchased faulty mortgagebacked securities it was difficult to find buyers when the market collapsed basically none of you mouthbreathers are doing fundamental analysis on the shit you buy nobody here cares about fair or instrinsic value this is talking about you

for noobies who dont know what this means the buffett indicator takes total market valuation and divides it by us gdp a very high buffett indicator suggests an overvalued market and could have been used to predict past bubbles such as the dotcom boom there are two arguments against the buffett indicator as a useful metric the first argument is that gdp is a backward indicator and therefore doesnt account for future growth while this is true it misses the entire point the point is that future growth estimations can be faulty and lend themselves to irrational greed during bubbles the point is to tie market valuations to some realworld metric which is necessarily backward looking the other argument against the buffett indicator which holds more weight is that us stocks consist of global companies and therefore arent adequately represented by us gdp i will say these people have a good point but they are also missing several nuances within gdp and market valuations which are too complicated to address in this already fucking huge post suffice it to say the buffett indicator still has something useful to say about market valuation and cant simply be discarded

new fancy ways of evaluating the worth of a company back in the dotcom boom companies that obviously had zero revenue or sales were valued in terms of eyes that is the value of the company was based on how many visits they had to their website this internet thing was a new paradigm and so obviously we needed new metrics to determine how valuable these companies were needless to say the vast majority of these companies many of them worth millions were simply worth nothing and went bankrupt overnight take your pick of favorite meme stonk that has some bizarre rationalization for its absurd

financial relationship with any hedge fund i had no information about gamestop except what was public i did not know any people inside the company and i never spoke to any insider” the reaction from ws establishment reacted swiftly to curtail free trade obviously due to the achilles heel exposed by gill simply exercising his right as an american to invest in something he believes in what gill did

is some redeeming value in taking short positions—mostly because they claim it helps correct overvalued securities this fundamentally breaks the law of fair trade where the exchange is good for both

problem with that philosophy is real business loss has real consequences to investors employers employees econ101 students learn this gill was exercising his right as a goddam american to invest believe and possibly save a good company from bankruptcy despite gmes management short comings it might have been believable that rh stopped trading because their liquidity was in jeopardy and the collateral required to cover settlement would have broken their bank…but there should have been an expectation of restricted trades across the board not targeting gme or amc and the telltale sign of collusion may be that other brokers also halted trading why that’s not been discovered there are some great postulations here on wsb for instance

httpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsldm13xsignthepetitiontodestroyshortsandgetrid if you believe what financial analysts are saying you find yourself admitting that wsb is now wielding a nuclear weapon capable of ripping the shit out of the financial markets is this even conceivable take these quotes for instance “but theres another level of danger to the gamma squeezes this involves the relentless highvolume buying in lowpriced far outofthemoney call options to drive a stock price higher by forcing the market maker to purchase the stock as protection against their selling the calls assuming they cant find another party to take the risk for market makers unable to pass the risk they could soon find themselves out of business we could also see market makers begin to abandon stocks” – real money “such damage to general asset prices producing the worst week for the sampp 500 index since october pales in comparison to what would most likely happen if one of the intermediaries were forced into a disorderly deleveraging whether it be a broker or central clearinghouse if not handled well this could have much broader effects especially because the nonbank segment of the financial system has been in an unprecedented period of rapidly rising debt leverage and risktaking aided and abetted by too many years of excessive policy reliance on experimental central bank measures and regulatorysupervisory gaps… …this is not just an epic david versus goliath story that has now attracted worldwide media attention potentially in play is the democratization of finance techled disruptions to market hierarchy the overall valuation of markets regulatory and political responses and the market structure itself” – bloombergcom the rhetoric coming from ws is quite the freudian slip they basically revealed that their business is all about manipulating the markets something everybody knew but didn’t really understand how to stop… in comes populist investment groups like wsb wielding millions of small buys like a hoard taking on goliath death of thousand cuts… several analysts on camera admitted openly that gme would have easily gone to $1300 if it were not for the brakes being slammed regardless of your political leanings big tech censorship should be a concern… this is a blatant attempt at squeezing the little guy out letting the hfs act like bulls in a china cabinet if a company is going under and a bunch or private citizens want to save it while making money… more power to you… the government should be concerned with some state actor with deep pockets using proxy buyers to cause short squeeze after short squeeze… you thought game stop was dangerous given the sentiment it is entirely possible that gme could go

investing in companies that dont have products yet eps is earnings per share and pe is price to earnings these things mean the company is actually making money looking back the company got pretty fucked by covid their eps dropped from over $100 in 2019 to the $061 listed above in 2020 but their earnings have largely recovered as of q4 2020 $028 in 2019 vs $024 in 2020 also of note they indefinitely suspended read axed their dividends in 2020 to more aggressively invest in their growth areas overall theres nothing exceptional about those numbers my key takeaways were that unlike some other companies in the sectors raven is in the price isnt insanely inflated the fact that over 80 is held by institutions blackrock vanguard and thrivent are the top 3 holders all of whom added last quarter is also reassuring as for the leadership no one really stands out as an all star or an asshole the ceopresident is a home grown dude who started at the company as an intern back around the time of christ everyone is about what youd expecta dude with a masters from mit a buncha dudes with mbas etc bottom linethis isnt some artificial hyped up bullshit ampx200b history tldr 🥣🏭👴💭⌛➡🎈🏭 lets go back in time to the time of dinosaurs 65 whole years agowhen the contiguous 48 was the only 48 some chucklefuck busts into his bosss office at the cereal factory they work at chad god damnit im done with this shit harry maybe this betty crocker making rocky and bullwinkle sponsoring bullshit is not for me maybe i want to fly harry sounds good mr chad sir us navy and my axe and boom a raven baby mre i dont understand 😖😢 fuck i gotta spell everything out huh back in 1956 a bunch of duders working at general mills yeah of cheerios fame high altitude research division broke off to form raven industries after their big brained leader ed chad yost got a $47000 grant from the us navy after he built and flew a tethered hot air balloon you remember all those old its a ufonah bitch its a weather balloon stories turns out a bunch of those were made by our boy ed chadboth from his time at the cereal station and from raven itself mre that sound like an old company 😭 i dont like boomer shit 😓😥 yo shut the fuck up if pfizer founded in 1849 is still around and providing little blue fat green gains you bet your undescended testies that a company like raven can do the same but i hear you that was then this is now whats raven done for me lately raven aerostar tldr 🎈🕵️‍♀️🏋️‍♀ decades later raven still gets some of those fat military contracts last monthhttpswwwprnewswirecomnewsreleasesravenaerostarandpersistentsystemsnetworkconstellationofstratosphericballoonsincommsdemo301217001html they demoed a platform where they use a constellation of stratospheric balloons to create an on demand low cost reusable wireless networking system above battlefields or other points of interest these arent your kids party balloons and dorothy these arent the wizards balloons either they have a bunch of different types created for different things some of these things go to the edge of spaceremember that dude who drank too many redbulls and jumped out off a balloon that was raven you remember googlealphabets loom project where they were going to float hot spots around the earth using balloons yeap raven in 2015 nasa needed to test their supersonic decelerator to do that they had to drop it from the edge of space guess how they did it you bet your ass it was a big fucking balloon made by raven raven got a special award for that btw but that wasnt the end of the relationship in 2020 alone nasa threw $3mil at raven for all sorts of weird studiescosmic rays the magnetosphere atmospheric sciences seismic events on venusthey used balloons and raven for all that shit mre i dont give a fuck about balloons well you should along with that shit above ravens balloons have a bunch of capabilities that have yet to be fully realized simply because we dont have the technological capability to use it lets say for example that we wanted a worldwide network of autonomous delivery drones what if there was a platform that could float around providing both a charging base and a warehouse simultaneously amazon has already thought of doing this with blimpsairships i dont want to mislead you there have been no public discussions between amazon and raven that ive found but i am sure that raven would be a leading candidate to build them what if you want to carry 8000lbs of fuel up to 110000ft and let your futuristic spacecraft or drone or whatever refuel when it gets there what if you want to go and survey an alien planet balloons can do all that shit they can lift a shit ton of stuff for cheap theyre semiautonomous and can control where theyre hovering and they stay up for months at a time i get it though fuck balloons i guess raven aerostar also makes military radars and early detection systems payload recovery parachutes think rocket parts falling back down high altitude payload drops etc stratospheric airships aerostats which the army keeps buying various dry suits and other ppe wait dry suits why raven engineered films tldr 👩‍🔬👨‍🔬🧪➡👩‍🌾👩‍🚀🥗🎈🏠 you thought raven industries was just aerospace and defense fucking wrong raven is a conglomerate for you smoothbrained fucks that means its a business slaver its a business that makes money by owning businesses that actually do work these include raven aerostar aerostar international inc and aerostar technical solutions but also other shit when raven started doing crazy shit with balloons there literally werent companies making the materials that they needed so what did they do started making it themselves along with the various materials for the balloons raven learned to make all sorts of materials ultrathin ultralight films check thicc ass fiber reinforced shit check everything in between double check seriously you want some shit to wrap around your plants so youre not wasting water how about shit to put over one field while another one is being fumigated what if you wanted to build a temporary structure to keep something warm while a more permanent structure was being built what if you had a shit ton of nasty ass shit that you didnt want leaking into mama earth land fills fracking water etc what if you had a fuck ton of cotton that you had farmed but if it got wet shipping bills would be 5x more expensive what if you needed to ship some veggies across the country you ever see those half built houses getting carried down the road with big ass pieces of plastic on them so you cant see in the living room what if you want to build your own living room but you got argon seeping up out of the ground yeah all of this is raven and im just scratching the surface i was going to try to cover everything but fuck i still need my fingers to buy fds go look for yourselfhttpsravenefdcomproducts then check out geomembraneshttpsenwikipediaorgwikigeomembraneapplications and again thats just one of their products and they have all sorts of ways to do this they do blown film heh cast film sheeting laminating coating and basically anything you could think to do with large pieces of single materials so theyre fucking with space military farmers builders energy and more they got flying shit beeping shit floating shit antiseeping shit honestly its kind of hard to stay on track writing all this speaking of staying on track though raven applied technology tldr 🚜💻🛰🥗🍅🍊🥔🥙💲💲 yeah i get it this is long as fuck ima keep this part short raven one of the leaders in autonomous farming tech and precision agriculture want to make the best possible use of some specific land and get that bitch farming itself raven is the company to call they make and use field computers and gps to measure with submeter accuracy and then provide the data crunching to plan it all out they even have a software suite designed to enhance efficiency on the office side of farming businesses also of notethey acquired an autonomous agriculture startup smartag as well as majority ownership in another autonomous tractor startup dot technology corp at the end of 2019 they acquired the rest of dot in 2020 and have been folding their stuff into ravens preexisting systems ever sincethe first revenues from this acquisition are probably just now coming to fruition with much more potential review and future tldr 💹 $5065 end of march $7090 eoy so if youre keeping up raven is an established company that came from at the time futuristic ideas and has recently made moves showing its still looking toward the future at the base of this growth it already has long standing relationships and active contracts with both the us dod and nasa a ton of products with space and futuristic applications ownership of production for proprietary materials used in aerospace construction farming and just about everything else autonomous agriculture solutions and precision agriculture planning software fuck this sounds like something mama cathie would like because it is arkq currently owns 333 of ravn and that number has been increasing cathie has been using the past few red days to buy some shit on sale but shes also been buying ravn at 52 week highs shes bought ravn 4 out of the last 5 trading days excluding today or maybe noti dont have that info at time of writing im not gonna spout some bullshit about guaranteeing itll be in arkx anyone saying something is a lock is just lying to you mama cathie does as mama cathie wants and well all fucking like it that said i would be extremely surprised if its not a consideration for her so where do we go from here just like the balloons we go up obviously nasdaq has been doing its best to keep this birds wings clipped the past few days but ravn has been growing regardless at least prior to todaymay have finally gotten it to come down temporarily but im not ruling out a late rally regardless im looking at hitting a new ath around $50 $17b valuationbefore the end of march sooner if ndx can quit being a bitch if its added to arkx i think $60$65 $23b valuation could be realistic in that same time frame because of their refound focus on growth again shown by their cutting dividends to reinvest and recent strategic acquisitions im targeting $70 $25b valuation without arkx or $90 with $32b valuation eoy ampx200b upcoming events march 23rd earnings release march 29th first possible date for arkx launch assumedly the holdings will be announced by this date

lqrs3a,none,n/a,blackberry and aws webinar was today,dd,472,0.96,gochugrande,137,my revision and additions to a deep dive post on bb for all of you on wsb if you think bb is a distraction from any other stock then scroll on past these tendies new blood httpspresentationsakamaizednetfilelibrary12184awsblackberryfinalslidespdf blackberry and amazon web services just finished their webinar explaining their multiyear global agreement to develop bb ivy they are addressing the undeniable need for software development in the growing and evolving automotive space in terms of apps shared mobility and software development and updates and how they can help solve and transform them tldr blackberry will help automakers address the security issues while delivering constant updates to a vehicles software in their infotainment system apps voice assistant capabilities and also active safety features including self driving they will also help monetize on the ecosystem of invehicle apps and services and bb will also be a bigger giant in this space because compared to apple or google who want to own this information bb offers it to their oem partner they are transforming the ui and product design of their products in cars and also working on a way of allowing customers to communicate to other endpoint destinations and operating systems not just qnx key points 1 ivy benefits the whole valuechain because modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components these components which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors produce data in unique and specialized formats this requires highly specific skills required to interact with this data and with bb ivy there is no need to worry about special automotive programming languages hardware variations or proprietary sensor data formats this means the developers won’t need specialized or automotive software skills and the consumer driver gets more frequent feature updates allowing for better performanceexperience along with safety of their data 2 data is the new goldoil blackberry pivoted from phones many years ago and has had a vision to build a data analytics platform for years which they showcased at ces 2 years ago in a bloomberg interview john chen says that this new business model creates a recurring data business for bb this revenue stream should not be overlooked as a mckinseyampco report outlined that connected cars will allow for the oems to monetize data from connected cars we all know that 710 most valuable companies in the world generate billions in profits from databased services chen explains that amazon is interested in bb 1 qnx provides amazon with a secure safety certified os aka the “plumbing” or ecosystem ivy will be built on 2 bb secures all endpoints in the internet of things 3 potential move to provide endpointbased security platforms to amazon alexa amazon delivery drones smart stores etc what does amazon provide bb 1 aws experience with user interfaces 2 aws cloud 3 machine learning models from aws management console so what about competition chen points out that he is not worried about apple and google entering the space as they also only have experience with user interfaces and but they lack experience in the oem space with the ecosystems the leverage bb also has over them is that google and apple want to own the data themselves where bb would offer it to their oem partners which is very valuable data to automakers end note the automotive space is changing rapidly as every single company is rushing to make more technologically advanced cars if you own a tesla you are already aware how crucial the apps self driving car software updates etc are all crucial to the experience of next generation cars 61 of the ev market already use qnx and soon every car will be needing more security and bb is already in 175 million cars that haven’t even scratched the surface of being next gen among amazon baidu and motional lucid motors is also on the plate and hiring a qnx specific engineer at the moment bear’s case the opposition says that bb’s revenue has yet to prove that it has grown as a software company in the automotive space one of the first disadvantages according to analysts is that it’s still a smallscale company compared to several of its software security competitors this will make it very difficult to compete with competitors much larger the company also hasn’t proven it can consistently grow its business solely as a software company furthermore blackberry stock has slowly been losing market share for years especially in endpoint management so although operations may be stabilizing as of recently analysts still see a tough path to consistent growth for blackberry but in my bias opinion bb has tackled many of these obstacles just this year partnering with big names in different spaces has provided recognition new sources of revenue and public awareness nobody is forcing you to read bb updates and i ain’t trying distract you from shit bb isn’t a boomer phone company anymore educate yourselves in any stock before investing my nonprofessional price target $2000 is feasible and modest eoy 2x 3x from therenobody knows what the limit is but it’s a steal at the current price

closing price data essentially the models try to learn the underlying dynamics of the closing price and then project future closing price based on that they are by definition not sensitive to any company fundamentals or macroeconomic conditions to limit the effects of this limitation i am only showing shortterm price forecasts 2 weeks i consider these models to be performing automated technical analysis specific price forecasts are almost certain to miss the mark but by looking at projected returns and projected price curves we can identify promising entry points and temporarily undervalued companies disclaimer what you see below are the median forecasts projected by the model in backtesting evaluating forecasts against historical data these forecasts missed the mark by an average of about 8 with forecasts for larger companies being somewhat more accurate closer to 5 this is not investment advice i currently have 2 shares of enph almost 20 of my portfolio lol as of

inflation,dd,19212,0.93,wonderboi1995,8801,our father autist michael burry burry if you read that dont be offended we mean it as a term of endearment you are our hero has called the next crisis he posted a book on twitter that i will link here i have just finished reading the book the dying of money here i will attempt to summarise why he says the end is nigh i read the book so you didnt have to ampx200b unfortunately i need to first explain some simple economics but here goes most of you already know many of this stuffyou can skip a bit ahead this first bit is for all the new retards we have recruited ampx200b in order to stimulate the economy america and other governments by way of their central banks ‘print money’ they do this by buying their own governments bonds in the open market they sometimes as during the covid crisis buy corporate debt too they actually literally ‘buy’ this money with money they ‘digitally print’ that money comes from nowhere they add a liability and an asset to their balance sheet and boom printed money their intention is to stimulate the economy by reducing interest rates when you buy a bond you push it’s price up which then decreases it’s yield – if that relationship confuses you here is an example a 1year bond is trading in the market at 98$ this bond has a par value of 100$ so you can buy the bond at 98$ wait a year and receive 100$ a nice 298 2 yield below fed buys bonds yields go lower ampx200b yields fall as government buys bondshttpspreviewredditk5c2gmio6ej61pngwidth554ampformatpngampautowebpampsf2519e2a3c5964b329dda0de9e05d03316876656 if interest rates go down businesses borrow more money to invest and jobs are created because investments create jobs but if an economy is running at 2 interest rates then even investments yielding a meagre 25 would be invested in because they can earn the difference 05 why doesn’t the printing of money by way of decreasing interest rates cause inflation immediately well actually it does it creates inflation immediately in stock prices the ‘printed’ money doesn’t go to your average citizen it goes to corporations who sell their debt to the central bank it goes to big investors who sell their government bonds back to the central bank because they can earn more in stocks this way they are clever they know a stock yielding even a stable 3 will earn them more than the current bond which only yields 2 ampx200b ampx200b stonks go up when fed prints relationship is dumb simplehttpspreviewredditxvtnb39w6ej61pngwidth553ampformatpngampautowebpamps093073729951c00917ffd9a974cb5974ba76c39b ampx200b start reading here smart autists when does printing become a problem the central bank looks at food prices general household items petrol prices housing and other goods that the average you and me purchase almost every week bundle these together and call them cpi consumer price index – inflation inflation in certain goods now let’s imagine a scenario you have 100 people in an economy 2 people are stinking rich and the rest get by fine but don’t have much extra to invest or save each month they use their savings to purchase mediocre goods a new bicycle or a new tv why would they invest that extra $100 it’s too little a sum to have any affect even in the long run on their lives now we look at the rich they already have the tv the car a wife and a girlfriend and maybe a few houses where does their extra savings go straight into stocks and maybe a new car every so often finedining and other sorts of things which are not in the cpi consumer price index basket ampx200b watch this mr central banker comes along and prints an extra $1000 give this money to the rich man what will he do he already has the car he already has the houses he will invest it straight into the market bam stock market inflation stock market goes up this is what has been happening since 2008 you will see a graph further below that displays this process the extra 1000$ does not affect the cpi basket…the rich man is not going to suddenly eat twice as much or buy 10 more tv’s the “stimulus” money from the central bank inflates only the stock market give this 1000$ to the poornormal man what will he do he may treat his wife to dinner buy his kid a bicycle that he couldn’t afford fill up his truck pay his rent it is not that he is wrong to do this this is most likely his best option a meagre 1000$ in the stock market will have no effect on his life even in the long term the point here is that central bank ‘printing’ does cause inflation it causes inflation immediately in the stock market because that’s where the money goes only when that money ‘spills’ into public hands think stimulus checks does inflation in the ‘cpi’ sense of the word unveil itself inflation becomes a problem inflation becomes a problem when it isn’t accompanied by its good friend economic growth inflation has an interesting effect of raising bond yields investors don’t want 2 bond yield if inflation is at 3 so they simple do this they don’t buy bonds what happens when someone doesn’t want to buy your house you lower the price no one is buying bonds bond prices go lower and therefore yields rise – remember if no one buys the bond the prices go from 98$ to 95$ supply demand at the end of the bond’s life you get 100$ so the yield rises as the price falls the inflation problem occurs when the average man got his hands on some of that sweet government money the poor man was able to effect cpi because he will actually purchase goods in the cpi basket give every poor man in america 1000$ they will go out and buy from a limited supply of goods a limited supply of goods supply demand and prices rise inflation – cpi ampx200b what do we do there are basically only two outcomes to this scenario 1 if inflation in cpi caused by the average american’s stimulus check opening of the economy increasing oil and commodity prices gathers momentum it will finally unleash the latent inflation potential of america everyone who holds dollars or dollar denominated debt – meaning every single country will pay for america’s inflationary sins fortunately poorer countries who are indebted to america should actually benefit from this under this scenario inflation will need to increase by this much look at red line in graph ampx200b ampx200b the red gap is the inflationary potential the inflation that has not yet been realised but it does exist and needs to be realised eventuallyhttpspreviewredditzp2yb1r57ej61pngwidth463ampformatpngampautowebpamps3ab58d80429b169749c0d3b868007983fb5889f5 you can see that in 2008 the central government began its shenanigans in a stable economy money supply should increase sort of in line with gdp as you can see above money supply has increased far more than that that gap indicated by the red line is inflationary potential it now basically just sits in stocks under this scenario by my calculations money supply needs to come back down to real gdp the central bank won’t do this they won’t tighten that would hurt too much but the naturally forces of inflation will do it for them and prices in the economy will inflate to catch up with the money supply 2 scenario 2 a highly probable outcome japanification japan has been doing qe for a much longer time than america the reason why they haven’t blown up in an atomic bomb of inflation is because this money never reached the hands of the middle class or the poor so that inflation couldn’t occur in cpi however inflation did occur everywhere where the rich were as it was them who had more access to this money america’s central bank could by way of printing even more money buy more bonds and push down yields they could let inflation run for a little while and hope it doesn’t gain momentum if inflation gains real momentum which it could because they are giving money to the middle and lower classes then they cannot follow japans lead if inflation remains muted and low the real issues of wealth inequality will only persist and worsen ampx200b it is not to say that the managers of these governments are inherently sinister in their motives to conduct qe which disproportionately benefits the rich it may just be the only way they know and by human nature people would rather be instantly gratified leaving future generations to pay for inflationary sins ampx200b what happens in scenario 1 summary inflation goes out of control cpi inflation stock inflation has already had its turn yields rise central bank get’s spooked and tries to raise rates a little economy tanks due to raised rates 6 months later or maybe a year later and the currency has found equilibrium by depreciating around 70 relative to the price of real goods not relative to the price of other currencies or the currency has found equilibrium because they removed that money from the systemhighly unlikely stocks fall because yields rose and everyone has the next best opportunity to invest into the stock market ampx200b what happens in scenario 2 summary inflation rises a bit due to stimulus checks central bank remains unconvinced that inflation will gain momentum if inflation does not gain momentum the central bank will continue to print until they see gdp growth stocks go up but until the wealth gap is too extreme and a revolution takes place this could take 10 years or 100 years ampx200b ampx200b inflation only becomes a problem when the poor get to buy normal goods that exist in the cpihttpspreviewredditsoxtt7dm7ej61pngwidth602ampformatpngampautowebpamps247b3ccb7cb0c36c3a51064517ae66099b86ab80 ampx200b tldr you dont deserve to benefit in this crash it is a

lrdg2q,gsat,-40.60%,gsat dd its the spectrum stupid,dd,257,0.95,industrial_trust,213,this is all off the top of my head but it’s a basic outline of why i think gsat is a big deal there are a lot of people who understand the company better than i do but i really think this is worth looking seriously at and its up a little bit today so here’s my first stab at dd be advised i’m not a sat com expert nor is this investment advice and i really have no idea what im doing here also i should say price targets for gsat range wildly ive seen targets over $200 per share floated around with some pretty impressive analysis behind it but more conservatively im in line with suggestions it could be $30$50 if and when all goes well in a very optimal scenario and it seems theres a much broader consensus on a 7$ to 10$ target in the near term gsat owns c band and s band spectrum which with the push to 5g and internet of things has suddenly become incredibly valuable recent fcc auctions will attest to this for years gsat was waiting for fcc authorization on that spectrum but by the time they got it they had issues with debt and investors were wary to jump in without a clear monetization plan for their spectrum the heavy debt situation has since been resolved giving them enough of a cash runway to continue in for the next three years their business model during most of the past decade involved satellite phones and gps tracking which with their aging satellites and limited market for that kind of stuff was never meant to do much more than keep the lights on while they waited for the value of their spectrum to appreciate their share price languished under $1 for a long time until 2021 when a couple things started to shift they partnered with nokia to set up a secure redundant 5g node for the port of seattle with more similar collaborations likely down the line then most recently qcom announced that their x65 next generation snapdragon modem which is the most popular smartphone modem in the world will connect to the n53 band specifically gsat owns this band of spectrum nobody else qcom obviously did that for a reason but as of now there’s no widespread usage of that spectrum as it’s not really being used except by gsat spot devices and phones which is to say hardly at all exactly what that means for gsat is unclear but what it does mean is that within a few years millions of devices around the world will have the ability to connect to their spectrum there’s a lot of dd out there breaking down price targets but the truth is nobody knows and the ceo and other execs have shown an incredible amount of patience and personal investment in terms of allowing their spectrum assets to appreciate while putting their own money on the line to keep things afloat over the years starlink atampt verizon should all be interested in buying and have probably all made offers or overtures but gsat has not bitten even when they needed the money which also suggests that the company is not interested in a sale and indeed leasing the spectrum might be far more lucrative than an outright sale and better for shareholders i wont bother describing the different possible monetization strategies here as ive linked to a report published by nokia at the bottom of this post that does a much better job than i could gsats spectrum is sometimes compared to a large swath of undeveloped beachfront property in the middle of south beach completely clean and unsullied in the middle of an increasingly crowded and frenzied space they look like a penny stock at first glance but they are far from it and it may be the ultimate 5g play you might ask what about musk’s starlink aren’t they going to eat gsat’s lunch edit this is better addressed in a comment by usquishjonesjr starlink use ku band for their user terminal links and ka for the gateway links they wont need any spectrum in cband also doubt they would purchase spectrum to ensure others cant use it their main focus is not going bankrupt their initial constellation will cost $10b and could be much higher if more sats are needed filed for up to 15k sats not to mention their gen 1 sats have a useful life of 5 years so they will have to replace those soon after service start usquishjonesjr starlink probably doesn’t need gsat spectrum and for our purposes gsat is not really in competition with starlink as their current business model which will be affected by starlink is not the source of the stocks theoretcal valuation but if someone did want to compete with starlink they would need to access gsat assets which is another reason why starlink might need to get there first not because they need it but because they dont want anyone else to have it starlink is a possible buyer for gsat not for their satellites but for their spectrum the value of gsat is not in its satellites or the ground units its in the spectrum dish is another possible buyer for gsat some people point to debt issues with gsat it’s true the company has diluted its shares quite a bit to remain solvent over the years but they currently have enough cash on hand to give them a three year runway it would make zero sense for another offering to occur before a major monetization event for the spectrum and since this is 5g that monetization event is going to happen well before they run out of cash another issue often raised “the fcc can just seize spectrum and reallocate it if they want that’s what happened to insert late 90’s early 2000’s sat company here these other companies from what i understand had major issues with solvency and so they basically went to the fcc to see what kind of deal they could get if they surrendered it to be reallocated btw i’ve learned that the correct way to talk about spectrum is not as something that gsat owns or holds but as something they currently control seems risky betting on the value of globalstar spectrum was a risky play but now that qcom has legitimized the value of the n53 band albeit not explicitly or specifically in terms of eventual use case by including it in the next gen snapdragons connectivity ability the risk associated with the play has diminished a great deal the bear case of the qcom aspect of all this is that including n53 connectivity is more of a marketing trick than something they imagine will actually get used but given that n53 is extraordinarily underutilized at this point even that scenario implies that qcom expects to see expanded usage of that band in the short term also i thought it was interesting that nokia would publish this on their website httpswwwnokiacomblogcaseglobalstar6waysleveragespectrumassethttpswwwnokiacomblogcaseglobalstar6waysleveragespectrumasset from nokia “nokia customer globalstar inc a us based provider of mobile satellite voice and data services is in the enviable position of having 24 ghz spectrum that works everywhere meaning it has been globally allocated 24 ghz spectrum is in the sweet spot from a physics perspective because it’s good for both coverage and capacity although it’s not yet a 3gpp standardized spectrum band it has been approved by the federal communications commission and recently in other countries it’s remarkably clean meaning it’s clear has no cochannel interference and provides network benefits for both indoor and outdoor deployments globalstar turned to nokia to help determine the band characteristics for its available spectrum and identify potential application options nokia’s network planning and optimization npo team conducted a small cell network study of globalstar’s 24 ghz spectrum as compared to a similar hetnet network in 21 ghz the study proved the versatility of globalstar’s spectrum showing that operators with a small cell network could benefit from globalstar’s clean spectrum while those without small cell networks could benefit from its huge capacity in our study globalstar’s spectrum outperformed outdoor small cell deployments by 20 while requiring 33 less infrastructure for indoors in an urban office environment we were able to deploy approximately half the access points required since the band has no interference from macro towers operating in the same frequency the full report can be seen here the team went a step further to also provide six business model options for globalstar to consider “we were excited to work with nokia’s npo experts to help determine how to best monetize and maximize the use cases of our spectrum asset so we can deliver the highest quality experience to the end users” said jay monroe chairman and ceo of globalstar 6 ways to monetize amp maximize the spectrum 1lease the spectrum to incumbent operators – this provides extra capacity for operators and uses their own ran equipment and services operators can use clean spectrum without incumbrance and it supports standard capabilities like carrier aggregation roaming and redirection for globalstar this is a simple revenue model without any operational burdens 2dedicated inbuilding small cell spectrum – the analysis clearly shows the difficulties presented by macro interference to small cell deployments offering a dedicated clean spectrum band would dramatically improve the performance of these hetnets and significantly reduce the cost to deploy them globalstar could lease the spectrum to one carrier nationwide or carriers in geographic regions that wanted to reduce the strain on their expensive macro tower infrastructure 3use the spectrum as a satellite service enhancement – by deploying rans in globalstar’s high use areas such as air terminals shipping ports military bases or cargo handling facilities globalstar can both provide satellite offload and support high data rates and advanced applications enhanced services are provided to customers where they normally congregate and for these customers there is a layer of satellite redundancy in the event of disruptions in terrestrial networks 4lease spectrum for private lte systems to noncarriers – cable companies are increasingly interested in pursuing wireless services themselves globalstar’s spectrum provides an opportunity to add a private lte network on top of their dense cable plant alternatively as the inbuilding networks are further developed there may be an opportunity to include globalstar’s band as a private lte service on top of neutral host models 5directly provide private services to enterprises – by offering private lte systems directly to enterprises globalstar provides spectrum equipment and services to end user customers which provides direct control over the user experience and maximizes private lte system revenue opportunities these deployments of globalstar’s spectrum could be done while several of these other options are pursued simultaneously 6mass market product enablement licensing – globalstar could license spectrum to odm manufacturers for use in mass market this would include unrestricted use and products distributed globally this option could address the internet of things or connected car markets no matter what globalstar decides to do nokia will be there to partner with them – in the us and around the world we are also lending our support to the 3gpp standardization process and equipment manufacturing enablement which are critical for the spectrum’s

lrdrsz,none,n/a,i am a roblox developer and i know the absolute fucking power it has,dd,3322,0.94,wddfrt,1348,note game developer i make games for fun and do not actually work at $sears not financial advice i have been seeing posts about $sears going public on march 10th and i am ecstatic because i truly believe that it will blow up i have been a part of the $sears community for quite some time and know all the ins and outs of how it works another person and i have developed 3 $sears games that average a mediocre number of 500 players in total during good times of the day let me tell you the games are absolute dog shit but people still play it and spend money on it it wasnt easy to make as scripting is quite hard and im retarded but the games are so bad yet children still play it ampx200b wont be sharing what those games are for privacy reasons and dont know the extent of whether or not i can get in trouble ampx200b how much i made in about the span of a month during christmas time

profits 5050 and havent updated the game in literal months kids spend stupid amounts of money on this platform you might be thinking that it isnt that impressive but oooh boy im just getting started but first let me get into the details of how $sears actually works because it doesnt seem like many people understand it ampx200b how $sears works $sears makes money from people spending money on their membership called premium or from people buying their ingame currency called robux using the robux players can buy items from the catalogue whether its shirts gear or hatsaccessories they can also buy ingame powerups for different games everything is communitymade from the hats and accessories to shirts and games $sears used to be the only one able to make hats but recently has implemented a system where you can apply to be able to make hataccessory models $sears has made a few games for sponsorships but they are usually worse than the playermade ones now for how people make money $sears has a system called devex aka developer exchange where developers convert their robux into actual reallife currency the currency exchange rate is 00035 usdrobux there are some restrictions like not being able to exchange robux that was bought with your own money or not being able to exchange robux that was made from trading for more info visit httpsenhelprobloxcomhcenusarticles203314100developerexchangedevexfaqshttpsenhelprobloxcomhcenusarticles203314100developerexchangedevexfaqs basically when someone purchases something you made you get robux from it but $sears takes a predetermined of the robux spent and sends it into the void so that they dont have to pay you as much if you devex this number is usually 30 $sears isnt just a game its an entire fucking economy $sears is interesting because unlike traditional online development you dont have to pay money to keep up servers you can make anything that you want granted that its not against tos for absolutely free now for the juicy stuff this will not only dwarf my puny numbers but will also show how big and how much bigger $sears is planning to be one thing that i have seen is people talking about how much top $sears developers make and the numbers are usually around 40k a month while it depends on how top you are talking about let me just give you an example of how much $sears developers make in 2019 a single $sears developer made 50 million usd not only that but a single game has hit 16 million concurrent players a single game i got all of this information from the 2020 $sears developer conference httpsblogrobloxcom202007rdc2020recaphttpsblogrobloxcom202007rdc2020recap but thats not all from the conference from the conference we got a chart of milestones from

on $sears and skyrocket its profits tldr $sears is growing at a rapid rate one person made 50 million usd from developing $sears games in a year and $sears ceo david baszucki has huge aspirations for

lriabl,f,10.34%,dd ford is still undervalued as fuck but the catalyst could be coming soon 🚀🚀 rocket emoji stonks $f,dd,66,0.86,shart4,89,this is not advice i have no idea what im talking about i went to a dtier state school and got a c in accounting ii please do your own research and dont come knocking at my door when you dont make gamestop money on ford also this is my first dd after lurking for years so please be as mean as possible edited for formatting so we all know that evs are the future and that someday we are all going to be driven around in teslas so you could dismiss the legacy automakers as boomer shit stuck in the past but i think that the market has overcorrected for this and overlooked a couple things ford has been stealthily morphing into a techcentric automaker fords fundamentals are still really solid fords new management team gets it ill go into detail into each below here are some ford financials from yahoo finance to set up some context httpsfinanceyahoocomquotefkeystatisticspf forward pe 1053 ps 036 mkt cap $46b factor 1 ford understands where the auto market is going a couple years ago when ford announced that they were going to stop producing sedans for the us market i thought they were smoking crack sedans still represent a thicc market segment but nah they kept around the high margin trucks and suvs and let gm honda toyota have the dwindling us sedan market so that they could focus their resources on developing nextgen products and some of those are finally here and they are legit actually pretty good the mache $42k 300mi range 35 second 060 fast charging not quite tesla good yet but damn close this is a legit viable product and you dont get any of the tesla customer service issues if you factor in the $7500 federal tax credit its cheaper than a model y electric f150 coming soon best selling truck in america getting an ev version its going to be good too the legit info on this car is coming later this year most likely and its going to be solid theyve already demoed it pulling a million pounds which is bs because it was on rails so doesnt count so we dont get a real tow cap number yet but we know its yoked and its going to look like a real truck so they can capture the whole toxicmasculinitybutmywifecaresaboutclimatechange market they own part of rivian rivian gonna be dope af and if they can leverage fords manufacturing experience they could potentially skip a large part of the painful production rampup that tesla went through and ford gets paid in the process and gets access to the tech rivian develops teslas pe is like fucking 200 thats how wall street values tech companies and innovation companies share price is gonna go ape once the analysts figure out that ford is a tech company that is merely funded by a legacy automaker dinosaur factor 2 fords leadership gets it meet jim farley hes like jim hackett but palatable to the shareholders what does he care about yeah autonomous tech and evs would you prefer he be focusing fords attention elsewhere didnt think so httpswwwcnbccom20201001newfordceojimfarleyannouncesrestructuringandexecutiveshakeuphtml bear case fords fundamentals alone underprice it they make cars people actually want lord elon told godconduit cathie wood on her podcast its on youtube but i cant link it search for elon cathie wood podcast and its at 330 that evs sales will comprise 13 of global auto sales by 20232025 thats crazy growth given that evs were about 2 of us sales last year i know not fair to compare us to world but its not the main point just context if that growth rate holds were looking at like 810 more years of ice vehicle sales which ice vehicles do americans like thats right fucking trucks and suvs the exact vehicles that are fords bread and butter the f150 is the best selling vehicle in america and has been for years this vehicle segment is super margin the average sale price of an f150 is over $40k according to cargurus httpswwwcarguruscomcarspricetrendsfordf150d337 people pay stupid money for these things and ford will be happy to accommodate them so lets assume that my thesis above is incorrect and ford has no future in the ev space and will do nothing milk the dying ice truckyeah market until the day they hit insolvency how could we value them then fortunately such a car maker actually exists and its called fucking fiatchrysler they yolod everything into the muricafuckyeah market segment and will literally sell you a hellcat powered anything only car they make that doesnt have a v8 option is the fucking pacifica a minivan these guys are lunatics and prepeurgot merger had absolutely no plan for adapting to the future of the auto market except for buying gas mileage credits from tesla lets compare their stats to ford from above httpsfinanceyahoocomquotefcauvikeystatisticspfcauvi forward pe 578 ps 024 mkt cap $42b so the market is literally pricing ford right now quite similarly to fiatchrylser ask yourself whos future strategy makes more sense if ford fucked up literally everything going forward i think their valuation makes sense but if they have just a few product successes in the new automotive landscape they are going to stick around and theres your catalyst tldr ford doesnt make cars they make rockets that go to the moon

lrne4v,tsla,-11.96%,a 🌈🐻 perspective on $tsla,discussion,84,0.73,stbell13,125,long time lurker first time poster super 🌈🐻 on $tsla edit i forgot you guys cant read tldr short term 🚀🚀 long term big ⬇️ a good way to look at it is to increase in value tesla has to do everything right for years and still get lucky for the stock to go down they only have to fuck up once or maybe not even at all before i start let me make it clear that while i do eat crayons for breakfast lunch and dinner i am by no means an expert and this is hardly a serious dd like some others ive seen here before this is just my opinion and my take do what you will you beautiful retards also i like tesla and i respect them a lot i love that they made electric cars s3xy and i want one but god damn if they arent insanely overvalued im betting against the stock not the company lets just start off with some easy facts you paste eaters can understand tesla right now is more valuable than basically every major car manufacturer lyft combined i love their cars but dude holy fuck you absolute apes drove this stock into the stratosphere and beyond so lets talk why this action today is expected natural and imo only sealing teslas fate towards reality first tesla was practically insolvent not that long ago elon even admitted as much herehttpswwwcnbccom20201103muskteslawasaboutamonthfrombankruptcyduringmodel3ramphtml while they have done extremely well since then and have insane amounts of cash coming on hand especially q42020 where they skyrocketed in cash on hand up to 16 billion usd from $3b this worries me more than encourages me why arent they spending this cash on future rampd efforts paying down debt making even more factories yes yes india i know but more charging stations battery tech or even give a bonus to all of their overworked laborers and employees that worked almost 60 hour weeks nonstop despite coronavirus and rampant wildfires last summer to hit barely their delivery targets etc tesla already has mega churn because elonthe culture burns people out and a bonus would be super well received im sure nope they buy some digital currency you know the one look say what you will elon is a bit of a weirdo love him but man if he isnt unusual for a billionaire visionary and that move was definitely weird for a largeish corporation to do with so much money given theyre so young relatively unproven compared to other auto makers at least in the eyes of the boomer clan and looking to aggressively ramp up production to me it shows they dont have significant ideas for rapid future growth that they can realistically hit with that cash so theyd rather drive traffic to sales via well a meme that might be a genius move but its definitely nonstandard and doesnt speak to confidence in new development coming easily this means at least to me with tesla what you see is what you get they dont have any huge surprises coming or new products lurking that we havent already heard about robotaxi lol $25k car etc they dont have a huge pipeline of new tech ready to roll out and they arent aggressively rolling funding into even further development to not only stay ahead of the giants that are creeping up but to run past them and push farther ahead ford bmw mercedes audi porsche etc all have evs on market this year and all have significantly more infrastructure and capital on hand to shift to meet the growing ev demand theyre behind but not for long they may be slow giants but they didnt get there for free and they have been there that long for a reason finally ev is the future for now but what if in five years its hydrogen or fucking fusion or maybe even some bad stuff happens with ev and everyone wants ice again tesla is super exposed to one industry while the giants have their feet in both pools at once might make them slower but its also less risk and theyre not that slow seeing as theyre already on the market it is legitimately retarded to count those automakers out at that point just roll your 401k into robinhood second lets talk tesla fundamentals ish im not gonna dig into the numbers and financials because i am a moron and i dont know how what i am gonna talk about is the business compared to their peers here is what tesla currently sells and bulls say they are going to be insanely profitable from cars duh solar roofsolar wall robotaxis eventually insurance eventually semis eventually people like to lump batteries in here as some sort of profit saving thing but it really might not be maybe maybe not time will tell and ill talk about that in a second cars duh teslas are dope as hell they have had their issues in the past but theyre sick and people want them demand is there for sure and growing rapidly i wont deny but others are catching up just as fast as the market is shifting towards ev meaning when the old crusty ass mfs who dont know whats an electricity decide they want an ev they will have significantly more choice as consumers than you or i today if we were to go car shopping this will undoubtedly pull away from tesla sales you can assume that tesla somehow magically doesnt lose any interest in a field with increasing competition but this just isnt reality people like new things and companies that make new good cars will see sales tesla is that right now will they be that in the future im not certain see production scaling concerns above to really assume they wont lose any consumer interest despite growing competition theyd need to be pumping out multiple different models im talking a non cyber tesla truck some sort of hatchbacksport crossover maybe even an adventure sport rig like an ev 4 runner or the ev hummer thats coming out americans like big cars its a fact just because its an ev and saving the planet doesnt mean consumers want to sacrifice this is why tesla was and has been successful because they finally made an ev that wasnt fugly as shit and a laughing stock but if they dont continue to drive innovation into existing ice sectors with ev tech theyre going to get left behind tesla is gonna want to capture this market share and they havent even hinted at it so far i dont know specific numbers and i dont think anyone legitimately does so take everything you read with a grain of salt but tesla isnt going to be leaps and bounds ahead of competitors in the future ev sphere unless they really buck up if anything by not doing these things now theyre backing themselves into a corner and a specific look that might be hard to shake later next solar things solar wall and roof are dope but theyre not cheap and pretty niche right now it requires living in an area with enough sunlight and being able to afford them in the first place theres also just not a ton of consumer demand for this right now we could see a huge consumer shift towards personal responsibility for green energy in which case this stuff may become ultra profitable but its still a matter of scale i dont know their production numbers but with how little ive heard about it i dont think theyre huge and if demand spikes they wont be in a great place to capture it if they arent scaling appropriately see cash concerns above now lets talk robotaxis and insurance insurance is a dud thats not big money maybe im not just a retard but also an idiot but i truly dont think tesla offering insurance does anything positive for their bottom line the way i understand the proposition is that because theyre so confident in their selfdriving tech they would become your insurance company insuring you if fsd made any mistakes this is a lot of liability forrrr nothing they cant really take payments for it unless its well below what consumers pay now for insurance otherwise are they really so confident about their tech if thats the case insurers will drop rates and lay off employeesclose locations to meet those rates because a they like money and b its even easier money than now if theyre less likely to pay out at a certain point teslas insurance is more just a warranty than anything seriously profitable for tesla they take on a lot of risk and can only really do this once a certain number of autonomous vehicles are on the road to ensure their liability isnt too high and after regulatory bodies have been coerced into approving this otherwise theyre taking on a lot of risk for basically no gain robotaxis are equally dudish again maybe im just a fucking mouth breathing smooth brained ape but people like people even though people bitch about other people everyone bitched about being insideaway from society during rona and never seeing anyone some people like those random interactions you get with a real person and some people just truly dont trust robots both of these take away from potential customersmarket share tesla is likely to see from robotaxis also old people and tech dont generally mix getting better but still old people and robots likely wont be a hot seller further regulation and the required insurancewarrantycoverage whatever for this whole operation wont be quick or cheap what happens when someone has a heart attack or passes out asleep or faints in your robotaxi what happens if it does happen to get in an accident or if it gets a flat tire what happens if the address is wrong or someone needs to change where theyre going what if they have a thick accent and the vehicle doesnt respond or what if they arent a native speaker or are disabled mute deaf blind need assistance getting into trunk or intoout of car how do these situations get handled finally not everyone wants to have random people in their car especially without supervision what if someone trashes your car or pissesshitspukes in there while theyre drunk sure tesla or whoever might cover you but robotaxis wont clean themselves further what about charging the cars wont charge themselves after theyre done with their shift so unless youre able to go out and plug it in what happens if charge is too low for you to then drive home guess you gotta wait not saying its impossible just that there are a lot more factors that need to be addressed before this is a slam dunk and heres the kicker its not even a super profitable industry uber is operating at a loss and theyre the defacto millennial ride calling service lyft and yellow cab still exist among a host of other ride sharing services especially abroad in places like asia europe is much more walkable imo so its not as popular from what ive seen but in major cities london sure it still is overall robotaxis arent really gonna be the future unless a fuckload of good shit happens for tesla and basically every boomer suddenly loves robots plus if everyone has a tesla who the fuck is riding in the robotaxis even if you assume somehow tesla starts being like usps or amazon and delivering packagesgroceriesbecomes a god damn short bus there still will be competitors and its still not as easy as saying but its the future semis i dont know shit about shit here but i havent heard much more than a peep about this so im naively assuming its not a huge corner of teslas business projections for the future maybe tesla becomes the daimler of ev and sells only big ass ev semis but i doubt it i dont see this being a huge money maker perhaps im very wrong lastly batteries lots of people like to say how teslas batteries are gonna make them tons of money and much better than their competitors blah blah but i dont really buy this their tech may be really good now but other companies with a lot more money and history of development are coming hard for the money in the ev sphere i dont want to assume that these companies will necessarily make their own battery tech but someone will people like money a lot if these companies dont figure out how to build their own batteries like tesla someone will and here is where teslas battery strategy becomes not super useful tesla paid a fuck load upfront in capital expenditure to finance and develop factories to make these batteries if another company starts making batteries that are even remotely comparable to teslas they will likely end up a lot cheaper eventually not immediately because they will begin producing en masse to support allllll the other ev makers standardizing in the process no less not just the batteries tesla needs and if that never happens it means the ev makers made their own which means they are confident enough in their own costperformanceetc and tesla really isnt that far ahead i know tesla has a big advantage here now but that doesnt mean people who worked on tesla batteries wont go work elsewhere for more money and it doesnt mean these other companies wont hire young and hungry masters and phd grads to develop cutting edge battery tech straight off of their full ride to yale in fact that tech is probably already being developed in ivy league labs for fun by those exact types of people for their phd and professors using their grant and research money hell some boy scout in a garage in iowa might be doing it right now tesla may be a leader now counting on them to stay dominant and leaps and bounds ahead forever is not just foolish but stupid everyone buying in and hoping for this stock to go to $1500 is either completely braindead irretrievably stupid or not paying any attention whatsoever theyre assuming tesla is operating in its own little quarantine zone where nobody ever competes with them and theyre the golden child forever look i like tesla but no matter what endeavor they go after someone else is gonna go for it too tesla may end up being better at it but that doesnt make them insanely profitable off the rip and it doesnt mean everyone will use teslas stuff some people dont like the brand some people dont like elon others may just like other stuff more finally look at the anatomy of a bubble and compare it to teslas stock chart its shockingly similar i know i know thats moronic but im a moron and a 🌈🐻 so what can i say the other eerily similar chart and comparable situation is radio corporation of america circa 1930 radio was hot new shit and everyone thought it was the fuckin future dude so shares skyrocketed and everyone hopped in but oopsie turns out radio wasnt the paradigm shifting thing everyone thought it would be and stock prices tanked this has happened with every bubble ever everyone thinks theyre invincible everyone thinks this time is different everyone thinks the institutions know their shit and are never wrong ever cathie wood ähem ähem but every single time theyve been proven wrong fundamentals always matter and tesla aint there chief finally graham dodd buffet some of the most legendary investorsinvesting advice people ever whose advice has withstood many many decades and market conditions warn about buying at any price assuming the stock will continue to increase so no matter where you buy in youll make money this sound familiar how about those ludicrous price targets of $1600share sound reasonable unless tesla fundamentally shifts the way we as a society think about and approach transportation as a whole and i dont just mean ice to ev retards their valuation is completely temporary and entirely fucked theres a few catalysts that i can think of as well some bearish some bullish for some bullish ones uk announced uber has to treat drivers like employees not contractors meaning their profits will be hurt this does mean good news for robotaxis if and only if they can actually make them work profitably further loosid dont think i can say this name here is going public and rivian is slated to go public this year as well if these companies or nkla or nio or some other companies have significant and public blunders tesla stands to gain however some bearish catalysts are that those other companies are coming and if they dont fuck up theyre just more competition in an increasingly crowded space more choices means less profits for tesla also in case you guys forgot tesla is a pretty shitty company in terms of workers rights they dont offer 401ks and they have been staunchly antiunion further elon basically forced people back to work during the pandemic and reopened the factories early despite governmental orders and fired employees for not coming back into the office after having stated publicly they could remain at home he might not have been directly involved in this but tesla sure was while those have already eclipsed it isnt a promising outlook for the future and the breakneck speeds workers are being pushed to meet along with long hours to meet delivery targets are going to be very hard to maintain if they see worker fatigue and dropout im not saying theyre gonna miss targets but there is a chance that workers unionize or otherwise strikerebel and want more representationcompensationwork life balance this would reduce delivery targets and decrease profit margins further with a democratic party leading all branches and pretty activist voices in some pretty powerful positions companies like amazon and tesla that dont treat workers well may see legalpunitive backlash from the government if they dont change things themselves i for one would be popcorn meme watching aoc and elon duke it out on twitter over something like this also tesla is opening a new factory in india and there are factories in china but these might not be as great as people think india is in a lot of turmoil right now with the farmers revolt and there are some serious issues with the government there along with china and the uighurs i would be not too surprised to see some sort of governmental sanctions or tightened restrictions on trade until these countries resolve those issues which could spell bad news for tesla these countries are great new markets but like the usa they also have their own car manufacturers and other ev players tesla isnt going to have a monopoly anywhere so chill the fuck out so all of this paints my pretty grim picture for teslas stock price but heres where i do my retard math if you look at yahoo finance for teslas book value you get like $20share this takes into account all of teslas assets and liabilities now tesla could take on more liabilitiesdebt in order to fund more rampd and drop their book value by doing so but heres the thing they have like $16b cash on deck to do that and they havent i dont see them taking out massive loans that havent been normal business procedure for them in the coming years so take this book value and assume they grow at a rate of 50 year over year for 5 years straight which would be fucking insane this gives you like $154share book value now lets look at their peers and their sector ev as a whole is in a bubble imo so i dont think its really legitimate to compare to their ev peers ev is the tech bubble tesla is the specific stock issue in question affected most heavily because of namebrand recognition so compared to companies that have made cars longer than you or i have been alive toyota vw bmw honda daimler suzuki ford gm the average price to book ratio of those companies is 116 teslas is 3525 if you take the insane growth figure i listed before which represents 50 yoy true growth in the company averaged out over the 5 years to reduce any weirdness with new debt reducing book value and you add on a 125 increase of the pb ratio so 225 raw compared to their peers this assumes theyre 125 more pricey than their closest competitors after insane growth for the next five years meaning were assuming basically fucking everything above goes right for tesla and you price all of that in today you get a value of $401share tesla is almost double that today in my opinion teslas true value lies around $100share with an assumption of 20 yoy growth of book value 5 years in a row and a 50 increase of pb relative to peer average tesla is the pb sector leader with this factor added on you get $75share if you wanna be bullish and assume more goes right and things turn out better call it $100 or $150 this book value and its growth expectation wraps in things like profit margin and other fun little gotchas a lot of tesla bulls like to point to saying how tesla is supreme and much better than companies like toyota which literally fucking created lean manufacturing its called the toyota way that transformed not just auto manufacturing but any industry that remotely has anything to do with manufacturing in general put up against that tesla may be a maverick but they have some big fucking shoes to fill and stiff competition anything more than $200share and i think youre truly ignoring fundamentals and living in fantasy land like every other bubble occupant in the history of the stock market and human history so where does that leave us today well michael burry despite being pretty crazy is actually pretty brilliant and has been skepticalshort on tesla long before i decided to jack myself to the tits quantity wise not so much cost on cheap premie puts i dont think anyone can truly time a bubble and the actions that the fed has been taking along with upcoming stimulus checks and tax returns could prolong any top well beyond its natural range i could get totally fucked because of this but whatever i didnt throw in more than i can afford to lose so whatever happens happens plus as a 🌈🐻 id probably deserve it anyways the selloff that has happened over the past week i believe is the start of the blowoff phase were on the way down now its just a matter of how long it can hang on imo the big dip yesterday was our local bottom until we ramp back up to the back to normal section if youre long tesla personally id sell there i do think short term there are some decent gains to be had if you buy now and hold for a week or two im not an expert but im guessing in about a week or two were back up near $800820 and thatll be about the peak after that i think the stock loses steam and drops off to its natural level wherever that ends up being between $90 and $1600 if you listen to analysts really insightful shit really narrows it down the bounce back today for me has more just confirmed the shape of the bubble and reactionary tendencies that people are pretty predisposed to and kind of just confirms that the movement is based more on sentiment and human psychology than true fundamentals i might be wrong about the timing but im as close to certain as ive ever been about a stock that this is going to go to sub $200 levels in the next year if im right im buying a tesla positions lots of 319 puts at different sub $300 strikes planning on buying more cheap otm short term puts every month until this stock goes down or i go bankrupt sadly was a greedy fuck and didnt sell one 226 $590p during the big dip yesterday feel

lrp9qv,none,n/a,solid state batterytechstock,discussion,33,0.74,3strikesout,81,ok guys listen up as you might know this is the last era of the lithiumbattery you know that chargebale battery and the one and only reason why you have to charge your phone every 2 hours and your tesla who doesn’t have one these days after 400500 km let’s not forget a battery’s purpose is to stores energy the more energy you can store in a smaller battery the happier we humans are energyhappiness finding a costeffective and efficient solidstate battery for electric vehicles could prove equivalent to finding the golden fleece in greek mythology according to the legend anyone who possessed the golden fleece would be considered a true ruler according to the present technology anyone who could develop a costeffective and efficient solidstate battery would rule the ev world a few listed companies are working on revolutionary solidstate batterys instead of liion solidstate batteries use solid electrodes and solid electrolytes for the ones who never heard about these use opera or google to dyor solidstate batteries promise already today twice the energy 1100th of the size 6x faster charsing 10x longer lifetime nonflammability this new piece of 21thcenturytechnology will definitely evolve coming years elon musk already called it the moab now let’s talk stocks a few companies are working on a solidstate battery expecting to bring it to the market within a few years today much of the development work on solidstate batteries is performed with partnerships among the players are conventional liion batterycell manufacturers ie samsung sdi lg chem a123 systems battery separator technology solutions suppliers asahi kasei and materials suppliers solvay umicore etc quantumscape panasonic samsung lg ionic materials bmw solid power toyota ilika according to yole développement’s market forecast mass production of solidstate batteries will begin by 2022 and represent less than 1 of liion battery demand by 2025 this might explain the relative low interest from investors today which might change when large solidstate battery manufacturing capacities start to be built samsung lg bmw etc are all searching for the solidstate battery for own use so that is not interesting for me to invest in they already reached their market share today there are 2 stocks i want to discuss with you quantumscape and ilika you might have heard about quantumscape before qs went to the moon $10 $130 when volkswagen announced it took an extra 20 stake in the battery manufacturing company crazy times on the stock market back in the days now qs is stable between $40 $50 fair price for a company with no revenue but a huge potential in the ev market qs is already backed by $300 million worth of investment from volkswagen bill gates and hedge fund billionaire george soros ilika is also a pioneer in solid state batteries trading around $3$4 ilika has has two development programs stereax miniature batterys for medtech goliath solidstates for the ev and other batterypowered transportation the scope of growth is huge in both industries compared to qs and to see what’s happening with their stocks lets only focus on the ev market ilika aligned a road map where the plan to start production of the solidstate battery in 2026 that’s the same period as the planning of qs ilika actually plans a prepilot this year and a construction pilot in 2024 for more information dyor so why is ilikf trading $2$4 and qs $40$50 founded by stanford university scientists a decade ago with financial backing from volkswagen ag quantumscape became a public company in november after merging with kensington capital acquisition corp a specialpurpose acquisition company spac when the spac deal was announced in september the parties decided a $33 billion valuation was appropriate following a blistering stockmarket run quantumscape is now worth more than 10 times that initial value those who bought shares in the kensington spac in august have enjoyed a 1060 return quantumscape’s prominent backers include venture capital firms khosla ventures and kleiner perkins microsoft inc cofounder bill gates hedge fund billionaire george soros’s quantum partners and investor jeremy grantham jb straubel a former chief technology officer at tesla is on the board these people know how to bring a company to the market and make it moon $$$ looking at their financials and progress qs and ilika do not differ that much they both have enough capital to fund the business processes for the next 57 years and both planning to bring their product to market in 2025 to understand the difference we have to look in the type of investors of both companies and their strategy for production the difference is qs plans to build a gigafactory to manufacture their batteries which asks for a huge investment 05 billion – 750 million per gwh that is the real reason why they are raising these amounts of capital ilika has chosen a different route they will use the uk battery industrialisation centre ukbic as a first step before scaling up through an existing manufacturing company to get to the gwh ukbic is a key part of the faraday battery challenge fbc a government programme to fast track the development of costeffective highperformance durable safe lowweight and recyclable batteries therefor ilika doesn’t need the same capital investment to fund their growth so here is the point solidstate battery technology is the future of battery ilika is growing in multiple industries including the ev market therefor i believe ilike is a save and good investment for the long term what are your thoughts on this is ilika a good

lrsylv,none,n/a,thoughts on copper as an inflation infrastructure green energy play,discussion,18,0.58,larossmann,167,i am bullish on copper and id like a critique of my thesis when i used to work in the recording studio business back in 2007 8 9 it was well known that most people trying to start studios fail miserably there was always hype around a record label or some famous producer opening their new studio which would fail soon thereafter theyd have amazing platinum plaques and credentials but when they start their own place they fail horribly they often had more musical talent than managementbusiness talent and would faceplant also when normal people would see the success of one studio they want to start their own and reproduce it who wouldnt want to make their living recording cool music all day i was talking to someone who used to work at a place like sweetwater one of those venues that sells equipment to all of the wannabes something stuck with me that ill never forget they told me you dont make money off the dream of opening a studio you make money selling the dream of opening a studio sell the equipment the fiberglass for panels the preamps the console the high end tube u47 microphones the setup of the facility all that jazz regardless of whether the studio does amazingly well or fails entirely you made your money during a time of so many peoples home studio businesses recording people for cheap on craigslist failing so many professional studios failing retailers of the products necessary to set up said facility were doing amazing selling the dream generates more stable income than chasing the dream lets transfer that analogy to new infrastructure plans green energy startups solarev companies wind energy companies etc theres going to be an infrastructure plan regarding green energy coming out unless biden was fibbing about a 2t plan to tackle climate change which is hard to believe with a democratic house amp senate to try and guess which companies that will benefit when they will start making profit whether they will go tits up or do well and whether they are currently in a bubble thats too much for my small brain to try and time it is even harder is icln going back down to $18 because its a bubble before it goes to $30 when biden begins his 2t plan or is it going to $100 before he announces it what car company will do best is tsla overvalued at its humble 1500 pe and about to get spanked by some surprise ford or gm comes out with or is tsla going to make 10000 pe the new norm by this time next year timing this and picking a company as well as when bubbles will burst is impossible i dont have the brain for it one thing is for sure every single one of them will need copper copper is an excellent conductor low resistance low oxidation cheap it doesnt matter whether the company makes billions or goes tits up it doesnt matter if a specific solar panel company makes great panels and sells record numbers or shit panels that all get recalled in order for them to even get started living the dream someone needs to sell them the commodities necessary to get started before they create much less sell a single marketable product they have to buy the copper we combine this with another tailwind the us dollar going to shit the dollar appears to be getting obilterated stimulus is going everywhere federal reserve balance sheet is exploding with seemingly no end in sight inflation occurs as a result of two things adding more to the money supply and a drop in production of goodsservices if huge swaths of entire industriesjobs are considered not essential by politicians for extended periods of time you have a loss in production if people get sick and cannot produce as a result you have a loss of production and if you have seemingly endless qe money printer go brrr means more money everywhere to buy up a limited number of goods and services the result is inflation i am seeing copper as a green energy inflation play that is less risky than speculating on any one particular company or fund as someone who believes inflation will get worse and that green energy is the future i think copper is a bullish play i am not quite sure the best way to take advantage of this if this is the case im more sharing this to get criticism amp ideas from others than to actually give advice i own shares of a few copper etfs right now and some icln at the time of this posting and am not trying to give advice but rather find holes in my thesis so i can make better investment decisions tldr my theory is that there is a triple decker event that will cause copper to soar more than it has and continue soaring is this a good investment thesis and if so how can i best capitalize on it reasons 1 government subsidiesspending directed towards solarwindevclean energy companies causing a boom in demand of copper 2 endless moneyprinting shortage of copper from the pandemiclockdowns pushing up the price of

lrydwd,gan,-29.59%,bet on $gan,dd,24,0.71,snowysnowcones,41,gan due diligence what is gan gan “game account network” is a nasdaqlisted b2b saas company providing product services to landbased casino operators that help lower customer churn and drive increased visits by consumers though the company may not be well known to usbased residents the company has been operating for nearly 20 years in europe and has global headquarters based in london more recently the company has targeted the united states as a growth area as individual states start to create regulated environments in which they allow online realmoney casinos to operate many states have started to legalize and regulate online gambling the first being new jersey in 2016 in which gan has a partnership with betfair gan now seeks to accelerate this growth in more states with additional partnerships and expanded product offerings product offerings gan offers 6 total products 4 of which will be covered below as they account for 902 of revenue as of q3’20 and have the clearest growth prospects simulated gaming simulated gaming allows users to play traditional casino games online without the chance of winning real money for casino operators simulated gaming allows the operator to create an environment which users can play games in a market where real money gaming is not yet legal while users may not have a chance to win money casino operators can still entice users to play through special offers that drive them to their physical casino eg play for x hours online and get a free night additionally simulated gaming and real money gaming run off the same backend platform meaning that any user data acquired during the simulatedphase is extremely valuable once the switch is “turned on” to allow for real bets to be placed real money gaming real money gaming is exactly as it sounds users deposit money and play games online with the chance of winning real money in return gan provides many of the same games you see inside casinos without the user having to be physically present real money gaming is still barred in most states and like physical landbased casinos online casinos are highly regulated in which gan’s software complies with all local regulations gamestack gamestack is the backend software that ties everything together think of a highly specialized crm system that serves as the technical hub of the player’s online gaming presence starting with the basics the software tracks every time a user plays a game and every bet the user makes within the game allowing operators of gamestack a rich pool of data to mine from additionally the software includes a patented feature called ibridge gan recently licensed this ip to a client for $3mm which allows players of online casinos to be linked back to landbased casinos loyalty programs with the ibridge technology landbased casino operators have high visibility to loyalty members online and offline playstyles and can tailor personalized content messages and promotions to its users tying the product offerings together gan will typically enter a market with a landbased casino and offer gamestack and simulated gaming in anticipation of real money gaming becoming legal in the state at a later point this works well for both gan and the casino operator – gan has a new client on their platform sticky and the casino operator can push messages and promotions to their users in the simulated gaming environment for example if a user is playing simulated gaming in a state where online gaming is not yet legal the user may receive a promotion for a free night stay at the casino based on their play history in addition once online gaming becomes legal in the state it just needs to be “turned on” this means the casino can use the rich data pool that has been building during simulated gaming and tailor messages to push users to play online with real money or drive them to the physical casino other product offerings gan offers two other products that are not covered in detail 1 game distributionpublishing – gan provides a service where it creates online versions of existing games for the license holder those games can also be distributed into the online casino world where gan’s software operates 2 rgs remote game server – rgs allows developers who want complete control of their global distribution the ability to set up a unique instance of gamestack with the private instance of gamestack the developer can operate proprietary content in regulated and social markets while maintaining control of distribution and pricing how does gan make money gan has a revenue share model meaning they take a small slice from every transaction that occurs on their platform this ‘take rate’ varies between customers but generally lies somewhere between 5 7 think of gan software as the toll booth taking a little nugget each time someone places a bet the better gan’s customers do the better gan does what’s the outlook okay – so gan has a unique product offering in a market that is increasing in size as additional states pass bettinggaming legislation gan estimates by the end of 2021 50 of all states will have passed sports betting legislation what has been making waves recently that gets investors excited about gan 1 coolbet – did you notice how in the product description there was no talk about a major aspect all casinos have sports betting that’s because until very recently gan didn’t have a sports betting product that integrated into their software suite in q3 of 2020 gan signed an agreement to acquire coolbet which closed the first week of 2021 if you’re not familiar with coolbet they provide a sportsbook similar to draftkings or fanduel in quarter 3 coolbet had a trailing twelve month ttm revenue of $28 million and a cagr of 46 coolbet’s revenue alone will nearly double gan’s overall revenue 2 wynn agreement – gan signed a 10 year agreement with wynn resorts in michigan to power their online sports book and casino known as wynnbet httpsmiwynnbetcomhttpsmiwynnbetcom given the successful rollout it seems likely that wynn would continue to use gan to power wynnbet in other states as legislation allows 3 fast growth in michigan – when michigan flipped the switch and allowed online casinos to go live on january 22 over the first 5 days michigan had 17x the number of active player days compared to new jersey this quick rollout is a sign that gan is gaining momentum and finetuning their marketing to ensure maximum revenue from day one is now a good time to buy normally this is the spot where i would present some common fundamental ratios perhaps project future earnings etc there are two things that make this difficult for gan 1 the company has been listed for less than a year there isn’t a ton of data fully integrated into brokerage firms yet 2 gan and its competitors don’t make money that’s right gan scientific gaming draft kings golden nugget online gaming and many other competitors do not make any money that being said some fundamental ratios such as pricebook 1206 and pricesales 3094 are in line with competitors or lower given draftking’s pricesales is around 80 gan may still have plenty of room to run and for what it’s worth the company also loses less per share $014 than sgms $123 and dkng $098 given the company doesn’t make money yet this is definitely a speculative play however knowing that we should see many more states legalizing online gambling and sports betting over the next two years and there being a larger public interest in online gaming and sports betting i’m wagering on accelerated growth current position 5 shares buying more after earnings call on march 25 tldr gan makes backend software that allows casino operators to extend their physical casinos online players deposit real money to play online and the casino has access to user data and can push promotions to drive incremental revenue gan provides a full software suite simulated gaming realmoney gaming sportsbook and takes a share 5 7 from each bet made on their platform recent reason for optimism gan acquired coolbet sportsbook which roughly doubles their revenue

think look ive talked about inflation risks for three weeks now and this is old news at this point right there should be your biggest clue that those risks are priced in but i can give you more reasons but first let me be clear on one point this is a long term risk not a short term one the market will not crash tomorrow nor in the coming months but it can decrease the growth of the stock market or in the most extreme case cause a bear market or a crash but it seems like there are some confusion on reddit on what inflation were talking about so read this 10 times the inflation risks are not on consumer prices but on the stock market read it again again i said and keep reading it because im sick of reading posts about that those risks of increase in consumer spendings are way overblown and frankly nonexistant this is because the average consumer didnt receive much money from the government in the last year and the little money he did receive he used it to either buy stuff that he would have bought anyway or buy stuff for leisure purposes but have you seen amazons revenue you might say yes ive seen it i would reply part of this revenue growth was due to aws their cloud business and people being online more than ever during the pandemic so server costs ballooned but i grant you that there was a big increase in consumption on ecommerce especially but it was mostly due to people being stuck in their home they didnt travel didnt party or anything like that so they used that excess money to buy stuff online also they were pretty bored at home and buying stuff was a few clicks away so of course theyd buy useless stuffs there were other stuffs that impacted consumer spendings like people moving outside of big cities and making their home more confortable to live in because you know theyre stuck at home so when countries reopen this trend will probably slow down although its setting a shift in consumer spending from brickandmortar stores to ecommerce but thats another story and with the us exports increasing during the pandemichttpstradingeconomicscomunitedstatesexports the dollar increases enough in value to offset potential inflation risks so yeah this inflation was never really a concern but now lets talk about the stock market inflation concerns that most institutions were worried about the concern is as follow gt fed buys bonds and gives money to companies banks and hedge funds hedge funds and banks put this money in the stock market stock market goes up artificially thanks to all that money companies use this to compensate for missed revenue their financials dont look so bad because of all the money given to them but nothing is organic everything is given by the fed and this might create a giant bubble thats ready to burst ok so a few things about that the stock market being stretched is nothing new its been a bubble ready to burst for a decade or so the tech sector did very well without the need of quantitative easing the actual thing you should worry about is not a market crash or a bear market but rather a reduced growth thats why value stocks went up or flattened these past two weeks when growth stocks plunged most companies will increase in value but since a much bigger growth was priced in for growth stocks their stock prices went down by the way thats why teslas stock price went down that had nothing to do with its 15bn bet and for the concerns regarding all this money given to companies theres not that much to worry about when the economy recovers in my opinion slowly from end2021 to mid2022 companies will generate revenue organically and as the economy gets better moneyprinterman will progressively reduce his bond buying program and slowly go on phase 2 of his plan actually combating the inflation if it becomes a concern by then there might be a correction at some point but hedge funds still have a shit ton of money to invest and theyre not going to keep it in cash when we have a massive bull market like that and ill finish this rant by quoting our great savior mr moneyprinterman powell gt fuck your puts also theres an article that explains this very wellhttpswwwimnatixiscomenchmarketspostpandemicinflationrisk2021 ok now lets talk about powell speech for a minute powell talked investors were not impressed summary of the speech tuesday hey bulls nothing new keep buying seriously thats it he said he will keep buying bonds at the current pace because the economy has still not recovered as much as he would like he said that the inflation concerns are overblown then senators asked about racial inequalities and powell basically said wtf im just the chairman of the fed not the fucking president im paraphrasing a little although he aknowledged the problem he didnt give any solution because well as he said it very well hes not the fucking president again paraphrasing a little the senator kennedy asked do you think we ought to go catwoman on the budget and actually look for savings there yes he actually said that im not paraphrasing here powell said he didnt know the reference and frankly i dont fully understand what that meant either link of the video and transcripthttpswwwrevcomtranscripteditorsharedux2lcf7khcxcap893gbjj6a3vd6h8wjz47xz56elodbcvbsroyurmo4xtkomy8k2lb3wz87l89r0elemvojyvebgu he also talked about unemployment rates and that ah that was pretty interesting but todays recap is already long enough tomorrow youll get my quick thoughts on that spoiler alert its not quick c3ai is a must buy more than ever this is a short one because ive talked about this company in a previous daily recap so i encourage you to read it first but now i think this is the best time to buy the stock as it went down a lot recently its a growth stock and all growth stocks went down the past week or so but theres something that you might know chinese competition in the big data analytics space was and is still going strong the chinese government is tracking everyone down which generates a lot of data the chinese government gives chinese companies carte blanche on all fronts even if they become monopolies and they do heres a paper written in 2015 on how big the industry is in chinahttpswwwafcdudcomfrtransportafcdud387bigdatachinahtml but something might change that i really dont want to talk politics here so lets make it brief trump went hard on china and planned on continuing that way and people thought biden would not go as hard but turns out he follows pretty much the same strategyhttpswwwnytimescom20210217businesseconomybidenchinahtml theres more detail to it i encourage you to read the article and be informed on the situation so this might be the moment where chinese companies get a big hit they will probably get the same treatment as american companies and their big advantage will disappear anyway so my point is this my dd on c3ai still stands and the potential regulation on china gives you another reason to buy long term heres a list of luxury brand companies 2 days ago i wrote that companies selling luxury goods that hold their value are hot right now heres a curated list of companies that i think will benefit the most from people buying luxury goods watches of switzerland group it had a good run but it still has a lot of potential and its a better bet than the others imo compagnie financiere richemont sa lvmh ralph lauren corp also a good article that talks about thathttpswwwbloombergcomnewsarticles20210123unstoppableluxurystocksremindsomeinvestorsofustech quick update on my portfolio last week i was cash gang up until yesterday where i bought spy calls expiring in june i fucked up my timing i bought them 2 hours before market open because i didnt know powell was talking yesterday averaged down by buying calls at open as well i think now the inflation concerns are priced in the worse case scenario is not though but theres a very small probability that inflation will actually create an economic meltdown i expect to keep my calls for at least a month or two but i will revise my plan if the situation changes and i will update you anyways i hope you liked this one please feel free to ask questions in the comments and give feedbacks on

several laboratories in the united states and around the world 9 nobel prizes have been awarded for work completed at bell laboratories as well as 4 turing awards the c programming language as well as unix was developed here with the 5g6g arms race heating up it is time for the 100 year old thinktank to be leveraged once more tldr nokia is going to be one of the 3 kings in the world of 5g6g which will be used in everything that matters in the next decade and this is the absolute ground floor all data that i present is publicly available by no means do i claim to be an expert nor is this

capitalism imo modern institutions are very cunning everything they do has purpose from the cryptocurrency community in the previous bull market i have learned this and scaled it into larger markets the behaviors are the same but even more predictable due to the dominance of algorithmic trading just trade whale for institution nokia is seen in a negative light by retail and the whole gmerobinhood farce has further smeared their image to traditional retail investors many investors are repulsed from this company we have seen the clients of big tech influencing geopolitics to an astounding degree in the past few years through social media and surveillance capitalism i believe that financial institutions have now caught on and now are cashing out on social media to move the markets forgive me if you have disdain for wsb and the robinhood investors but i believe that there is big money behind them blackrock jpm etc they are a vehicle for change and a perfect fall guy for market manipulation some of the dd are likely released by blackrock themselves ive seen some of the accounts post histories robinhooders are looked down upon yet under the guise of anonymity they can release dd that far exceeds any big name analyst report it smells fishy 2 possible threads of speculation accumulation inst ownership as of q4 2020 is only 530 shares float is 5 bn childs play to manipulate with high

the solution why is elon musk focusing on starlink now it is the solution for teslas biggest roadblock 5g infrastructures are the neurons for iot 5g is huge it is of utmost importance why would the us go to such lengths to cripple chinas huawei for years huawei seems to be their number 1 target key contracts and partnerships the first company contracted to set up internet on the moon partnering

partner for its tipping point technologies for the moon program receiving a $14 million contract to deploy the first lte4g communications system on the moon 5g6g will be essential for space travel sounds like arkx will need to look into this one dec 1 2020 nokia and atampt extend worldwide iot network grid wing collaboration to deliver seamless iot connectivity to enterprises around the world

production and distribution within their jurisdiction their ultimate objective is responsible production distribution and consumption of cannabis and combating illegal drug abuse there are now roughly 15000 licensed cannabis businesses in the united states 200000 people employed in the industry and more than 2 million medical cannabis patients served by the industry we believe the time has come for the united states to create a legal marketplace as other countries have already done given the current political backdrop however we recognize this is unlikely in the nearterm that is why we believe—at a minimum—congress should honor the principles of federalism and states’ rights by passing legislation that respects the will of voters and state legislatures that have elected to adopt their own approach to authorizing the use of cannabis within their boundaries we also believe the federal government should allow this industry to function like any other business this means statelicensed cannabis businesses should have access to banking and other financial services operate with the same tax structure as other businesses and not be threatened by federal prosecution if

and bring us back to the good ol days before segregation where ice cream cones were a nickel and muscle cars were an icon of the era cool edit segregation is not cool but muscle cars are kinda i mean id drive a 2006 ctsv if i could afford one anyway cool i can think of two particular american auto manufacturers which were popular at the time ford and gm yes there is tesla but biden is a boomer or maybe even older and i forget what comes after two anyway so ford gm and whatever comes after and whats more is ford and gm are already cozy with the us government meaning that both have already received either large government contracts orand bailouts and president biden is a bona fide gman and good ol boys tend to do business together case in point i did not know this until writing this dd but oh look oshkosh truck has the usps contract to build all the new electric vehicles and who is sourcing them materials fucking ford when asked if the subsystems are engines and might ford have a piece of the contract as an engine supplier quigley said “the vehicle will be built from the ground up by oshkosh to fulfill the unique needs of the postal service we will share more information about the supply base in the future at this time we are not at liberty to discuss our supply chain for this program” oshkosh did not deny ford would play a role as a supplier  ford declined to comment

fucking love unions and according to the administrations clean energy plan any company which has a union or will form one seems likely to receive uncle sams rich uncle money auto industry create 1 million new jobs in the american auto industry domestic auto supply chains and auto infrastructure from parts to materials to electric vehicle charging stations positioning american auto workers and manufacturers to win the 21st century and invest in us auto workers to ensure their jobs are good jobs with a choice to join a union transit provide every american city with 100000 or more residents with highquality zeroemissions public transportation options through flexible federal investments yes its the lowest bidder which gets contracts but they have to be american throughandthrough and probably have to be a union shop which certainly narrows down the choices of companies even eligible to bid so lets take this from the top government owns the money printers government gives out

httpswwwgovernmentfleetcom301786federalvsstatelocalfleetshttpswwwgovernmentfleetcom301786federalvsstatelocalfleets biden is a boomer boomers love their ford and gm brands biden is a gman ford and gm have already gotten the g and like a horny ex big government prooobably wants to give them the big g again possibly at the same time eg multiplesimultaneous contracts giggity because evs ev infra and unions are sexy also ford is already a supplier to the usps ev stimmy contract and now the government needs to charge all these fucking granola evs but theres not enough infra well theres stimmy for charging stations in this admin too the biden admin is also printing stimmy contracts for ev chargers 500000 by 2030 and gm has a kinky new partner who has been working out evgo which has already built out evcharging infrastructure and is also going public q2 2021 and i dont want to speculate but if evgo unionized president biden would have to worry about more than just ice cream stains on his suit pants and evgo would have to worry about what to do with all of rich uncle bidenuncle sams money what i mean is gm might also be able to be a part of the ev charging contract like ford is a part of the usps ev contract or maybe gm gets an infra contract and is evgos sugar daddy again ive noticed a pattern the government has a ton of fucking money they even print the money shit they even own

lsuxmw,mdp,22.69%,meredith corporation mdp,dd,10,0.64,aykazu,44,hi wsb this is my first post here not going to lie i only found this site after the hype on gme amc and others personally im not much for hype in general but i do like investing and here is one of my picks from this summer meredith corporation mdp mdp is a media company and holds several well known magazine brands such as people and allrecipes along with over 40 brands im not going to list them all here but you can check them here httpswwwmeredithcomhttpswwwmeredithcomfbclidiwar3mhyw2qjuv0lomkdegvkj5ptzcnv3rc0i1qyw3uj1hdfgz31ftf2pk4 so whats the thing with mdp it is a beaten down covid19 casualty stock that has made some serious progress over the last 6 months and confirmation came just last earnings lets go over some key figures to understand the valuation shares outstanding 45634510 and these shares are in common and b class stocks as following common shares 40565853 bclass shares 5068657 share price as of premarket feb 26th 2021 2534$ market cap of 12b book value per share 13375$ or pb of 179 609m$ shareholder equity cash per share 83$ long term debt 2985b$ mdp just released its q221 results normal company would be q420 so i will be using the last 6 months as key information and try to break down the results into a normalized form as the results have been elevated quite a bit due to election cycle the data source that i use is the company 10q available here httpsirmeredithcomfinancialinformationsectionquarterlyresultshttpsirmeredithcomfinancialinformationsectionquarterlyresultsampfbclidiwar2z0rxxqxlf8pdsnfgxraotvkkmrahj3jfyozziipd3ympsfvdafbyc revenue 1595b up 4 operating expenses 1268b down 66 eps 393 6months cffo 2618m$ up 363 fcf 2498m$ and up quite a bit since it was bleeding cash in 2019 so whats the catch here surely this is very cheap valuation however it gets interesting when we look at the earnings presentation slide 7 to be more precise political advertisement h121 was 184m$ this with a 49 adjusted ebitda margin translates into 904m$ so in order for us to have a better understanding of the 6 month figures here we must subtract this 904m$ from ebitda of 3445m$ and we get 2541m$ of which da expenses are 988m$ so we get 1553m$ of which 20 would go to taxes and we get to 1242m$ net earnings so if we do not assume any value for the political advertisement we arrive at pe of around 10 for 6 months earnings and i do wish to emphasize this that we are not talking about 12month earnings but surely people here understand that every 2 years there is a new election cycle so at least 50 of the election cycle ebitda can be taken into account as we try to predict the future earnings power of mdp if we do that we arrive at net earnings of 1604m$ thats net earnings and eps of 352$ and the pe drops to 684 again we are talking about 6 months here now based on my calculation i can absolutely say that this is very inexpensive in my opinion company especially when we take into consideration that legacy print media while shrinking has already been surpassed by the digital media side as can be seen in the company earnings presentation slide 6 now going forward into q321 or q1 for us normal people i do not know anything except what the company stated in their latest cc and the cfo made a comment that did catch my ear and it was around 1520minute mark of the cc the comment went something like this as of the end of january we had over 450m$ in the bank and i do wish that you listen the call yourself if and when you are making your investment decision however to my ear that sounded like the cfo just mentioned that they generated over 71m$ in just 1 month per share that cash generation would translate into 155$ now for a company thats share price is around 25$ that is a lot so here is my take on the company what do you guys think,2021-02-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsuxmw/meredith_corporation_mdp/

lsx9cz,none,n/a,using the macd to possibly forecast the upcoming days,dd,83,0.9,rage1073,60,hey everyone i went ahead and mapped out the open and close of the market during the last squeeze as well as included charts to that may help us in forecasting what may happen in the following days i wanted to compare that event to the current one to perhaps extrapolate some patterns behind the charts i found some interesting things while doing so and i though i would share all of this is routine for a lot of people who read charts but for those that arent so great at doing so i figured this would help maybe others can extrapolate some bonus data down below is a chart that shows how volatile the days were leading up to the shut down by rh we can also see that the further the pull back was the higher the recovery was when it rebounded back up for example the downtrend between 127 and pre market 128 led to the price going to 490 on the pre of the 28th something that would have shot up like a rocket if it werent for the halts by brokers ampx200b daydateopen macdclose macdah openpm close wed12020213795 3880 39 3923 thursday12120213920 4280 4298 4427 friday12220214268 6511 6760 9850

on friday because it was shut down and not allowed to properly run its course so those numbers are irrelevant if you notice you see that some days blasted off while others dipped we quickly forgot how much of a roller coaster it was so this should ease your mind dips are normal even near the peak of the event yes dips will happen and they are normal so dont freak out when they occur diamond hand that shit because when they go up they go up big now i took some screenshots that will help us compare some key dates taken at a month view with 1 hour candles first we have this image of 120 125 ampx200b httpspreviewredditxwh53s43ltj61jpgwidth1373ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps0b98af0b100849f7ae3f2488ff814486e762ad55 if you notice the macd is about to cross above the signal line now im no expert but these lines help us understand if the market is gonna be bullish or bearish trend you can see the lines dance a bit with one another pulling away and crossing every once in a while but overall they stay in the same range that is until the 22nd during the premarket we see that the lines cross into bullish territory in a big way you can also note that they had a good pull back after the first day of the squeeze which is currently where we found ourselves yesterday so this is a good thing pull backs are healthy and as we can see above its what we want to see we can compare this to the days leading up to today if you look at the chart below you can see that the lines dance with one another we have pretty much traded sideways just like the chart above until the last couple days when we crossed over and under we can use this to identify and compare the beginning of this squeeze or rather map it out to the last one and possibly give a rough forecast of what may happen in the upcoming days ampx200b httpspreviewredditkqxeihybltj61jpgwidth1375ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps2f6d68d8cf8624fcb41b42ac854a5230753bf4c3 as you can see the macd just flew past the signal line indicating that we are in bullish territory before crossing again and bringing down the price now one thing that sticks out out to me is the size of the gap between lines on 224 it looks almost double in size to the last 120125 cross and rise in price another thing to note is the fact that the last immense rise took a couple days while this one rose in less than a day which explains the size of the macd gap as you can see below the macd would make shorter bursts up and down as the days kept going consolidating into an explosion we saw in the premarket of the 29th when rh and other brokers all restricted buys dont forget that rh wasnt the only one to do it ampx200b httpspreviewredditi35fpkp7ltj61jpgwidth1388ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps540e8ea977bc4d4bd29f1ea7afda173385ca3096 so imo remember im not a financial advisor so take everything here with a grain of salt i think we can get a rough forecast of what we can expect in the coming days by looking at the charts above and comparing the macd crosses in the last days to whats happening now remember not to panic and remember that this wont be a one day event it will most likely play out through several days what or when we will hit the zenith who knows because we cant see the full data thanks to the brokers who backed up the hfs but we can see that even through pull backs were set up for a nice rise there is a lot of pent up pressure that the hfs are trying to cover up eventually all that pressure will have to escape and run its course and as long as we hold and keep it up we will win the bigger and longer the pullback the higher we go again all of this is just conjecture and my humble opinion not financial advice ampx200b edit forgot to include my thoughts lol but i think we will have a slow beginning with a healthy rise near the end of the day hopefully it ends up going that route to quote uev1lgen1us from a broader perspective using the daily chart our first macd cross was under 20 bucks this time we are converging around 100 bucks now let that sink in its gonna get fun yes its 5x

recover from thursday’s tech rout gt us stock futures were choppy as tech stocks tried to recover from thursday’s rout that dragged the nasdaq down 35 for its worst singleday performance since october tesla fell slightly again in friday’s premarket a day after sinking 8 in a brutal week the dow jones industrial average on thursday sank 559 points or 18 from a record closing high the previous session the dow had its worst day in nearly a month and so did the sampp 500 which lost almost 25 the culprit behind the selloff was the rapid rise in bond yields gt all three stock benchmarks were tracking for weekly losses ahead of friday’s trading on wall street the nasdaq was clinging to a gain for february which started off strong the nasdaq was down nearly 7 from its feb 12 record closing high the dow and sampp 500 both remain solidly in the green for the month however the sampp 500 was off almost 27 from its last record closing high also on feb 12 gt 2 10year treasury yield retreats slightly from oneyear high gt the 10year treasury yield retreated friday morning but remained above 14 after surging to 16 in the previous session to its highest level since february 2020 and more than 05 higher since the end of january the spike in the 10year yield which is used as a benchmark for mortgage rates and auto loans has been driven by expectations of improving economic conditions as coronavirus vaccines are rolled out as well as fears of higher inflation gt 3 house to pass covid bill senate official says no minimum wage gt inflation worries are being stoked on the thought that the $19 trillion covid stimulus bill — which is seen passing the house on friday — on top of accelerating growth could overheat the economy democrats on capitol hill are trying to push their relief measure including a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour through without gop support however a key nonpartisan official the senate parliamentarian ruled democrats cannot include the minimum wage increase in the bill the decision means the senate will likely pass a different version of the bill than the house and representatives will have to approve the plan a second time gt 4 fda panel to vote on jampj’s singleshot covid vaccine gt a key fda vaccine advisory panel is set to vote friday on whether to recommend approval of johnson amp johnson’s covid19 singleshot for emergency use which

lsy6uc,none,n/a,dd about sha015 schaeffler a german industrial and car supplier,dd,14,0.66,gabbathrow,35,fellow investors autists and retards this is my very first dd and actually this is not about getting quick tendies and much more about a midterm or even longterm value play so if you do not want that please skip this post and go back to focus on gme otherwise keep on reading please note this is an old throwaway account of mine because i do not want any relation to be made between my person and this dd so this dd is about the german supplier company schaeffler sha015 be aware of some currency switching between € and $ as well as a wall of text key facts about the company this is their website httpswwwschaefflercomcontentschaefflercomenindexjsphttpswwwschaefflercomcontentschaefflercomenindexjsp they employ roughly 83000 employees worldwide generated 144 billion € in sales in 2019 175 billion $ net revenue of 428 million € in 2019 520 million $ 881 million € in 2018 which decreased because of the carcrisis precorona growth in sales and in revenue outperformed all supplier competitors and automotive manufacturers in the past years as of today they have 45 billion market cap 166 million shares publicly traded for 2020 figures see below what is the business model schaeffler is one of the biggest automotive and industrial suppliers worldwide it is a german company with solid financials read more below their focus relies on high quality and precision components and systems in the automotive and industrial sphere now what does this mean is automotive not industrial let me explain that schaeffler has three divisions automotive which is supplying almost all automotive manufacturers in the world even tesla industrial which is supplying stuff for machine tools industry 40 and iot solutions of mechanical form and renewable energy generation they are inside almost every windmill in the world afaik automotive aftermarket which is essentially the division that is supplying all the car workshops with spare parts for cars you can see they are setup in a broad way i have more information on the individual divisions down below now those divisions rely on the same knowledge and manufacturing lines more or less which generates lots of synergies in the company and creates additional value instead of just catering to all industries at all costs about the family shareholders and the stock schaeffler is more or less a family company which is listed at all major stock exchanges a couple of years ago they had their ipo with a listing of 1250€ 1518$ i think that was in 2015 they then rocketed pretty quickly to 1617€ currently only 25 166 million shares of its shares are free float and publicly traded their traded shares also have no voting rights but have a nice dividend to them 3040 of the net revenue the other 75 of shares have a voting right but are all owned by the family schaeffler by a holding company the family schaeffler the holding company also owns 46 of continental another supplier company that is almost triple the size of schaeffler and currently has a market cap of 24 billion € there is quite a lot as to why this is the case but in my opinion that is not really as important for this dd long story short in 2008 schaeffler tried to buy and swallow continental then the financial crisis hit and they had to take on lots of debt automotive technologies division with automotive schaeffler is generating the largest part of its turnover and revenue i do not have to add that this is also hurting them right now because it is obvious however when auto is back to business schaeffler always outpaced its competitors and even the oems with its growth and revenue share schaeffler has parts in almost every car in the world in the automotive division schaeffler is manufacturing and developing all sorts of stuff for vehicles this obviously includes combustion technology boring exciting is what new stuff they have on the shelves first of all that is a technology for 100 autonomous cars and they are currently the only company that has the permit to use this technology on the road in a lot of countries already right now google space drive next is technology for electric cars they acquired a smaller company that is known for its extremely efficient electric motors their wiring technology and know how is superior it seems like every other month schaeffler is acquiring new orders for its electric motors whether it be in pure electric cars hybrid cars or heavy duty vehicles they are also on the forefront of developments for the usage of hydrogen in cars and other applications also industrial besides the obvious business with european oems they are in quite large business with us and chinese oems chinese business growing the fastest according to their recent releases industrial division the industrial division is where they are manufacturing stuff for typical industrial applications like bearings for wind mills they are inside almost every wind mill worldwide afaik or machine tool stations here they are also working on developing smart bearings that know when their life span has ended this is crucial in large scale manufacturing lines where a bearing failure can result in multiple million $ of damages schaefflers solution for that is essentially marketed under the brand optime condition monitoring obviously incorporating all sorts of industry 40 applications as well as internet of things by the way schaeffler is also active in aerospace where they are actively helping to reduce the co2 emssions of planes i could see them maybe work with drones in the future and rumor has it they even work on adapting the emobility motor technology for the aerospace industry they are also inside many space applications such as space rockets and the rovers automotive aftermarket division aftermarket is where schaeffler is selling stuff and spare parts and repair kits to automotive workshops to fix cars essentially honestly i have no idea about the division and they make up for the smallest part fo the turnoverrevenue what is cool here is that afaik they can sell their stuff to all workshops and it can then be put into cars where applicable that were not even equipped with schaeffler parts originally which would mean that is quite a huge market the margins also seem to be quite good current financial numbers and costefficiency measures now that we all have a very rough understanding of what schaeffler is about and what they are doing let us talk a little bit about risks current financial numbers and what schaeffler is doing to increase their flexibility and financial basis initially schaeffler lowered their expected results for 2020 in january they then published an adhoc release saying that they unexpectedly outperformed their planning and can close the past year better than expected see here httpswwwschaefflercomcontentschaefflercomeninvestorrelationseventspublicationsadhocreleasesadhocreleasesdetailjspnewsid2059430httpswwwschaefflercomcontentschaefflercomeninvestorrelationseventspublicationsadhocreleasesadhocreleasesdetailjspnewsid2059430 from my point of view they will end up with 10 less turnover compared to 2019 which would be 13 billion € 157 billion € and a margin of 64 which is incredibly good for the current times if you are asking me might be that i read the release wrong lol how did they achieve those results let us talk about costefficiency measures they have initiated even before the automotive crisis started long before corona obviously i am not too fond here and we can only learn about this from their own publications they are laying off people closing plants that are no longer as profitable as before they are moving manufacturing to lower cost countries and they are digitalizing and optimizing all their processes according to schaeffler their initiatives are working and their preliminary figures underlign this risks well obviously if the car market or industry market keeps crashing and does not recover then this will plummet again the floor around 660€ held quite good though and we had a run up to 7€ the last days the thing is this company is heavily investing in new technologies now and tries to reinvent itself they recently announced an investment in a new central laboratory for rampd if emobility doesnt get big well then schaeffler is excellent in combustion tech if emobility kicks in which is what we all expect arent we then schaeffler has all the right equipment knowledge and tools at hand they even already get lots of orders for emobility stuff check their press releases from the past months in my opinion this is pretty failsafe another risk is that schaeffler got approval to issue new shares in the coming 5 years if the need arises approval was given in the last shareholders meeting in 2020 obviously the only one allowed to vote is the family shareholder so this is an obvious risk in the next 5 years stock price compared to other supplier and automotive stocks so yes as written beforehand the company is getting some flack for the boring combustion engine technology for having lots of employees and so on but how does their performance compare to other companies we can compare that with continental timken a much smaller us supplier and some automotive oems like vw gm and the like comparing their stocks charts reveals something super interesting all of the above pretty much all car manufacturers as well as suppliers started plummeting in 2019 because of a lack of car sales and then started a slow recovery until covid hit in march 2020 today most automotive oems are almost back to 2019 levels talking about suppliers the situation is a little worse but almost all of them are dealing with their stock being traded 1020 below precovid levels however schaeffler is at a much higher discount now if you factor in the performance of schaeffler in 2020 and the preliminary figures from above paragraph you notice that a more or less fair value of the stock would be something around 9€ while it is sitting at 7€ at this very moment so from my point of view there already is an upside of 28 in the short term once people realize this is trading at a discount not even factoring in what they are doing in terms of future growth with emobility and industry 40 stuff in the mid term what else is going on from here on this is more speculation than dd but nevertheless i wanted to mention it so last but not least there is something interesting going on lately besides the typical insider buying of shares which happens on a regular basis from almost all executives especially the ceo the family shareholder mrschaeffler recently gave all of his shares in schaeffler so 75 of the company as well as all continental shares so 46 of conti in pawn i dont know the exact english wording for that for a bank credit line essentially the shares serve as a security for the credit line now how much is that in terms of money more than 82 billion € almost 10 billion $ at the time this took place at the beginning of february so 10 billion $ in securities plus his other securities privately owned stuff would result in a credit that is atleast 10 billion $ from my point of view now why would you need that if you still have a positive cashflow even during corona and an auto crisis this is indeed a very good question so to answer this question i first had to research why anyone would have to put that many securities in the bank for a credit line and why would anyone use shares as a security the result is in 9 out of 10 cases this is typical behaviour for a loan that will be used to purchase and swallow another company i then researched which other companiescompetitors could be relevant and are in the ballpark of 812 billion $ honestly i couldnt find any but then i remembered that continental will bring its entire drivetrain division conventional combustion engine tech plus all the emobility stuff and electronics and mechatronics to the stock market with a spin off and coincidentally this part of continental is worth something around 810 billion € 9512 billion $ according to wikipedia you can google continental vitesco spin off however schaeffler already owns 46 of continental and as such also 46 of the supposed spin off company nevertheless this was the most reasonable thing they could do with such a huge loan in my opinion the schaeffler ceo always refuses this option and typically answers questions in that regard with agility is more important than pure size in his latest interview with a german financial newspaper couple days ago he said this again and also said they are more looking into acquiring something in the industrial sphere and not automotive also they would favor smaller acquisitions rather than bigger ones so take all that with a grain of salt target price nope you are not going to get this from me as i am not educated enough for it on march 4 they are going to release the 2020 full year results as discussed in the earlier paragraph the numbers are basically already published and are above expectations depending on the capital increase with new shares andor the purchasing of another company i can not predict any prices for this stock however i am on there with 600 shares at 12€ yes pretty sad i know lol but looking to average down personally i expect a potential increase in the shares price of 3060 in the midterm range tldr schaeffler is a solid german supplier with solid financials and a good business model compared to its results it is highly undervalued especially considering its current measures for cost efficiency as well as lots of orders for electric mobility projects from major automotive manufacturers in the billions for the next years fuck me because i jumped in around 12€share but it is a long term hold for me ampx200b no financial advice i like the stock,2021-02-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsy6uc/dd_about_sha015_schaeffler_a_german_industrial/

financials and can withstand it disclaimer i am not a financial advisor of any sort this is my opinion and it should not be taken as the word of god full disclosure i am also fucking retarded and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself this is also based on my theories and speculation as some of you may know osk oshkosh was awarded the usps contract for the new fleet of vehicles it was a contract for $480m to finalize production for nextgeneration vehicles the total contract can be worth up to $6b to supply 50000 to 165000 over 10 years once the news broke out osk went from ≈$103 to ≈$118 high this is about a 145 increase in the company’s value which is ≈ 1b in market cap value with osk’s ttm revenue of 72b it gave them a multiple of revenue of ≈112x the ttm ebitda $668m which calculates ≈ 119 times multiple these multiples do not account for the projected revenue and ebitda with the new usps contract the industry average on ebitda multiples is around 138 times for manufacturing companies the average multiple for auto amp trucking is 4573 times according to nyu stearnshttppagessternnyueduadamodarnewhomepagedatafilevebitdahtml without the projections of ebitda gains from the usps contract it is already significantly undervalued based on enterprise value ebitda tldr even if osk was at the alltime high of $118 per share it was still undervalued by approximately 32 times using ttm numbers no projections and based on usps gains this is based on the auto and trucking industry standards for public companies in other words it didn’t matter if osk got the usps contract or not it was still way undervalued i am screaming at the top of my lungs that osk is undervalued so you are probably wondering why osk fell like a ton of bricks back to $104 when the news about one house democrat cried foul play on the usps deal whatever i am going to say now is partially theory pulled based on available information online i would love for anyone to call me out if i may be wrong but post your positions also this is where workhorse plays a significant role in the movement of osk stock as some of you might have noticed wkhs’s value dropped by nearly 50 after it was announced that osk was awarded the contract rather than wkhs some may agree and some might disagree but wkhs was banking on the contract to essentially survive in other words it was a hail mary that would have saved them from all their struggles i will not go into enterprise value and ebitda ratios with wkhs or any of that because they only have a ttm revenue of ≈500k you read right 500k not 500m it would just be a waste of my time this is really scary because wkhs has a lot of debt on its books as of 9302020 wkhs had a net debt of $123228m additionally wkhs raised an additional 200mhttpswwwfreightwavescomnewsworkhorsegets200milliontoadvanceelectricvanproduction this adds up to around 323m in debt assuming they did not pay any off from 930 there was no way for wkhs to service that debt without bringing in new revenue if they cannot service the debt based on historical numbers how are they going to service the new debt the creditors approved debt as they were betting on wkhs getting the usps contract wkhs either had some excellent investment bankers or the underwriters need to be fired because this was pure speculation which is a big bet for debt financing when the news came out two days ago that osk was awarded the contract wkhs went tits up even though the terms on the loans did not require wkhs to repay debt until 2024 creditors felt the pressure as wkhs lost the contract additionally the company’s value decreased by half leading to any debt convertible to stocks being less valuable if creditors do not feel that a company is capable of servicing a debt they can recall the loan anytime correct me if i am wrong this probably was going to happen they were flirting with insolvencyhttpsfinanceyahoocomnewsworkhorsesharecollapseraisespressure131704051html and all their investors would have lost their investment the largest investor before all this drama was not ark it was your big institutions and mutual funds ie blackrock inc vanguard group inc the and seaport global asset management llchttpsfinanceyahoocomquotewkhsholderspwkhs and they would have lost a lot of money tldr paragraph wkhs was close to being insolvent if creditors decided to pull the plug they had all the reason to with wkhs losing the race for the usps contract disclaimer this is speculation and theories what does this have to do with osk going down they both have the same largest institutional investors backing the stock blackrock and vanguardhttpscafinanceyahoocomquoteoskholdersposk within a day after the news blackrock would have lost ≈$185m in value and vanguard would have lost ≈$137m assuming they did not sell any shares after 12312020 they both would have made only ≈70m from the osk stock price jump this leaves them with the choice of the small gain from osk or large losses from wkhs if these institutions let wkhs sink they would have lost all their investment which was approximately an additional $150m for blackrock and $100m for vanguard these are just calculations for 2 of the institutional investors institutions would have to bear a larger cost letting wkhs go bk without some gains rather than allowing osk to jump up from the news the creditors also would have lost a lot of money if this were to happen as there will be unserviced debt and a loss in value in the convertible stocks even if osk went down the suits would not have lost much money because osk can sustain itself without the usps contract with osk’s management osk has grown year over year this is not just enterprise value they increased revenue and ebit every year before the covid since the ceo has been in place tldr paragraph big money and creditors would have lost big by letting wkhs go bk it is okay for osk to fall in the short term because it is undervalued and they proved they could grow year over year this is where a lot of manipulation might be happening behind the scenes there was a bunch of shorting and options activity during this time this was probably institutional investors hedging their bets to make up for losses for example ark bought multiple dips on wkhs as the stock plummeted from the news they nearly doubled their position by the timing of god himself news came out merely hours claiming house dem will push back hard on usps decision to choose osk this is apparently one house democrat crying foul play not the whole house where the title tries to mislead you into thinking since osk was linked to the usps contract it fell with regards to the news in my opinion way too much as i believe it is extremely undervalued there might also be additional selling to exacerbate the wkhs dump as i finish writing this wkhs was a clear buy then sell scheme with news that was overexaggerated and probably paid for to minimize huge losses that would have come with wkhs insolvency the people who would bear the pain are people who believed that wkhs is a good company i have seen people comparing wkhs to nikola stating how it was undervalued compared to each other what they don’t understand is that they were comparing garbage to garbage with this belief that wood can do no wrong a bunch of people jumped over the cliff tldr paragraph osk had to take the fall for wkhs while the markets were manipulated to prop up wkhs so the suits would not have to take as big of a loss the pain will be transferred to the retail investors as a sea of retailer investors followed cathie wood into buying the dip positions osk 416 $115 call ely sbux t

lt2kv4,none,n/a,why equities are just in the beginning of the bull run long post,dd,208,0.93,nafizzaki,88,tldr this post will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now premise equities are selling off due to rising treasury yieldhttpswwwtreasurygovresourcecenterdatachartcenterinterestratespagestextviewaspxdatayield the reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex but let me try to explain nonetheless 1 people are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff now yields being that low it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and more appetite for risk assetshttpswwwreuterscomarticleususabondsmarketsiduskbn29q2nr plus bonds were already at a price where yields couldn’t have gone any lowermeaning existing bond prices couldn’t have gone any higher thus this lower demand lead to a rise in yields 2 this created a feedback loop due to mortgagebacked bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher they do it due to convexity hedging if you have no idea about what i said read this one uphttpswwwbloombergquintcomonwebconvexityhedginghauntsmarketsalreadyreelingfrombondrout this has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield overall this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the fed continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy thus the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher 3 jpow and yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time specifically until we reach full employment thus they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2 these are based on their publicly stated statements which means it may mean something 4 now consider the scenario real interest rate will remain negative the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario while we know that long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously over the last 20 yearsarticle data till april 29httpswwwnytimescom20200501businessbondsbeatstocksover20yearshtml with long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8 while sampp 500 having only 55 that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks the same picture emerges for the last 5 years since 2015dataset ourdatedhttpswwwbloombergcomnewsarticles20200317longdatedtreasuriescrushsp500performanceoverfiveyears 1 this whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century and as yield continued to fall the bonds rose in price as is customary now as the yield slightly rises it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price this also attracts more bond investors as a result i suspect that yields will not rise too much plus it is a very crowded trade 2 as a result of bond having this superb riskadjusted return stocks saw huge outflows according to cathie wood stocks saw $300b in outflowsexcluding repurchases since 2018 and bonds saw $1t in inflowshttpswwwmarketwatchcomstorystocksarentinabubblebuthereswhatisaccordingtofundmanagerarkinvestscathiewood11612958113 so if there is actually any bubble it is in the bond market think about it for a second sure bonds provided absolutely superior riskadjusted return compared to stocks but because of this everyone and their mother are in bonds stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets 1 now bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market in this scenario we wont be seeing any negative rates while continuing to experience negative real interest rate being a bond investor would be painful if you are a bond investor already you want the yield to go lower potentially negative but that is not happening either if yields rise you are losing money if you are a prospective bond investor you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on 5 liquidity is present in the market bonds arent that attractive stocks are a good bet in this scenario especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we dont go weimar republic style after all you are duddenly not going to stop buying from amzn stop using msft products or pltr products just because inflation is here question is which stocks i think boomer stocks are your best friendlook for the things brk buys and after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldnt be a bad idea eitheri think 6 us dollar has been declining after march it is overall good for the stock market and the global economy in general for one it makes it easier for foreigners to buy us stocks and two it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets one could say em stocks are a potential good source for riskadjusted return and i also think the same although short usd have had been a popular crowded and winning strategy for the last year one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the usd higher however in the long run i suppose em stocks would also be a good area to look out for especially india seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently 7 rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation and not specifically supply crunch some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage which would be bad for the market but i disagree we have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy stagnating wages high unemployment technological innovations cheap labour based production in foreign countries demographic challenges etc some supply crunch is definitely there but to say that production wont normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind 1 some of you may not know that cpi does include rents healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us so before you comment that the government is manipulating cpi to make inflation numbers low i would suggest you to read how and what are the weights of each consumption factorshttpswwwblsgovcpitablesrelativeimportancehomehtm also stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesnt really counter the loss of employment income 8 our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts it is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt thus our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low while also allowing inflation to rise you may think how can this be a free market if basically this is capitalism with usa characteristics add to that direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is well the various companies conclusion using my crystal ball which cost me $0 to buy i can say this this is what i can say from all the points that i have mentioned risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds usd is accommodative for the stock market global economic recovery especially in em economies will be good thus helping our companies deficit financing inflation will be good for most stocks liquidity is present bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops no deflation there is likely going to be real inflow into stocks stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds thus i think while we will have lower overall rate of return in this decade i think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while current panic in the market is nonsensical to me disclaimer this is not financial advice i eat crayons and stuff this is a casino dont listen to retards on the internet please dont i also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes risk of my predictions being completely off the mark fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheatingother events and starts quantitative tightening we do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon yields also goes to the moon black swan events think of something yourself man this was a long ass post and i am getting late for

lt47yg,a,8.70%,a slap back to reality,dd,102,0.62,billybobbjoebob,322,obligatory this is not financial advice i am not a cat financial advisor ampx200b i believe in a time like this a lot of people need a fresh glass of some ice cold water splashed right into their faces ampx200b tldr ape explanation i want gme to moon but i am concerned about people being fed false information 1 the claim melvin said they didnt close their short position at the hearing is a lie their opening statement specifically had them saying they did close it 2 the strategy of itm calls boosting the price was tested last time amp failed last time these are covered calls 3 there isnt enough of a short interest to force the price up by holding the profit comes when hf close positions but you wont know that happened until its over ampx200b i would love to see gme rocket to the moon and i believe there is a scenario where that can be possible but i want to go over the popular scenarios that will deceive you into believing they are the scenarios that will lead you to the moon this is not a bear post against gme this is reality this is for those of you newcomers who thought you missed out on the last gme wave this is for those of you who were stuck holding the bag last time me included and are looking at profiting from this time to make that money back this is for those of you who just didnt learn your lesson and need a reminder of what went down last time ampx200b as i said there are scenarios where gme can be squeezed but what scenario is that and what scenarios are not that ampx200b 1 first thing first i want to stop a lie that i have seen spread like wildfire the blatant lie that melvin capital during the gamestop hearing admitted to not closing out their short position on gamestop this is not true now i am going to assume whoever came up with this lie did it as a valiant effort to help boost the price of gamestop and probably hoped no one would call them out on their bs because nobody else decided to waste their time watching a 5 hour congressional hearing about stocks those are about the two most boring things in the world combined but you dont even have to get that far into the hearing to call this lie out for the bs that it is in melvin capitals opening statement within the first minute of it they state they closed out of their short positions in gme days before any restrictions were put on it you can look up videos of the opening statements yourself i wont baby you that much so in conclusion dont rely on the scenario that melvin never closed out their short positions its a lie and it needs some water doused on it ampx200b 2 scenario two possibly the most believed strategy on gme thursdayfriday keeping the price over insert dollar amount here by friday close makes insert number here of calls itm and when they cover the price is going to rocket now i am not going to say this scenario is impossible but it is not very likely and it is what got many people burned the last time yes it is true keeping the price over a certain price making a lot of calls itm can be good for the stock if those calls arent covered calls which i believe that almost all of them are the week ending jan 22nd there are probably a lot of naked calls that hurt the sellers bad when gme closed at a very high price nobody expected it that helped it a lot the following week when we saw the big spike but then lets run down what happened that following week yes rh restricted buying on thursday 28th which i do believe stopped the biggest of the squeezed but it would not have played a role in the ineffectiveness of the calls itm strategy that followed that thursday the price plummeted into the $200s that friday you heard a lot of chatter of as long as we can get the stock up to $310 a lot of calls will be itm and we will be golden my fellow apes get it to $320 and thats bonus points that will be 90k calls that will be itm and have to cover thats 9 million shares and yeah a lot of that was true there were 90k calls that would be itm if we closed above $320 and you know what we did we closed above $320 we closed around $328 in fact this was it come monday that price was going to the moon 10k isnt a meme we chanted we couldnt be wrong we did the maths we had the dd diamonds dont crack baby well come monday there was no lift off it was the space shuttle columbia all over again the stock fell and it fell hard going back into the low $200s dipping into the $100s even before closing in the $200s thats okay though thats fine they had until wednesday to actually close on those calls youd hear so tuesday came and went then wednesday too we never saw $300 again in fact by friday we were barely even seeing $100 so what happened what went wrong we had maths and anime on our side well what i believe happened is those call contract sellers learned their lesson that first week that ended jan 22nd when they got screwed they didnt let their calls be naked the following week they bought up gme stocks when it was low at the beginning of that week if they didnt already have them this allowed them to resell those stocks at $320 and under making them the big winners in all of this but that meant these werent new stocks that would help us go higher no these were stocks bought on the way up they helped us peak but wouldnt help us go over the peak so when those calls executed there were suddenly a lot of new holders of gme stock holders who saw their stocks were worth $300$320 these werent diamond handers like you or i these apes wanted their bananas now so they sold when they got them gotta cash in those profits at some point as wsb loves saying you cant lose if you dont sell well you also cant win if you dont sell so now flash forward a month later and the same theory is being pushed keep the price over $100 and we will rocket to $800 come monday no scratch that $1000 no wait even better $69420 you hear in the echo chamber bouncing off the walls like gme does in the first 30 minutes of market open thats not going to happen these are covered calls that are itm youre not forcing anyone to buy new stocks at the current price you are just buying stocks for $50$100 that were already bought at $40$60 and are keeping the stock price stagnant and none of this is even mentioning that the amount of itm calls this time is like a third of what it was last time so do not rely on this strategy ampx200b 3 scenario three they have to cover then we can set our own price this is probably the most ignorant reason and is why i typed it out like that yeah im mocking you get over it it is true they do have to cover eventually but not with your stocks gme short interest is somewhere around 4550 too lazy to relook up the actual number and this is after new reports showed 13 million more shares were shorted on wednesday now yes that is a high amount of short interest but that isnt high enough for the diamond hands approach theres still 50ish percent of shares out there not shorted and yes diamond handers hold a lot of those most are going to be held by institutions and those institutions are about the money not the message they see a 3x profit they sell they sell to whoever is willing to buy could be more diamond handers could be hedge funds but eventually apes are going to run out of money to buy and hold with thats when the hedge funds can swoop in buy up these stocks cover their short positions the people they borrowed from might not be diamond handers and end up selling to more hedge funds when the short interest is only around 50 you cant win with the buyhold strategy when the short interest is 50 the short squeeze happens and you dont know it happens until it is over and the hedge funds have covered you win by riding the wave up as hedge funds cover and then you get out near the top thats the end of your ride the ride doesnt just keep going up you can only set the price when you own most of the market and in this case we dont and on top of all of that you also have people who are doing this with their bill money the 1st of the month is coming up thats a lot of rent needing paid no shame in needing to sell so you can pay your bills but thats more shares that will flood the market probably a fraction of the actual amount of shares out there but pennies add up to dollars eventually ampx200b and those are the three scenarios in which you have a higher chance of losing than winning again i cannot stress this enough i do believe a short squeeze can happen with gme but i do not believe it is any of these three scenarios that will make it happen im just tired of seeing people being fed these these delusional optimistic claims that throw truth history and real dd amp common sense out the window treating gme more like a pnd than an actual short squeeze its okay to drink the koolaid but maybe check to make sure it isnt spiked first ampx200b edit ive been trying to reply to as many people as i can if they took their time to indulge me read my post and then spend their time writing a rebuttal to it i wanted to respect that and give them a proper response but its getting a bit tiring and i have other things to do so i will not be replying to any further comments i might keep going with the fun conversations but for the rest i will not

lt7miq,don,6.27%,dont sell at a loss some advice on fundamentals for new traders,dd,5697,0.94,dumputer,1145,💎🙌🦍here i wrote some basic advice ill repost here for any newbies who want to get in on the action or anyone who bought high and is for whatever dumb reason thinking about paperhanding paperhanding is fundamentally bad investment practice especially if youre a new investor ill explain why dislaimer ive only been trading for a few years and i only know this shit because i have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff and he hasn’t steered me wrong yet so take it for what it’s worth but based on all the fact that paperhanding is even an issue here you apes clearly need this advice edit these are fundamentals to the way i trade but obviously everyones trading strategy is different note that this is a quantitative approach to investing which doesnt encourage yoloing this is one way to invest which does not require you to outsmart the general public by spotting opportunitiesvalue before the market does i feel its particularly relevant to the gme play the ticker symbol is less important than what you do with it there are other approaches which often require more experience but i feel this is most accessible to new investors gme is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything well everything that you don’t think will go bankrupt or get delisted new traders or people who are thinking of becoming new traders should read this especially if youre new i think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market this applies to all stock not just gme if youre experienced it might just sound like im explaining at length why 2 2 4 but since a friend of a friend told me he paperhanded on gme sold the dip i feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea i would encourage people to buy gme but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while edit in addition just to reiterate keep plenty of money in reserve so you can buy more if the stock goes down by this i mean never sell at a loss simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down all newbie investors imo should adhere to this rule just in general buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground or don’t buy it at all many investors myself included follow this rule religiously not just with gme but with all stocks i have never lost money in the stock market because i never sold at a loss i just held or bought more covid crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out i just held and was fine should have bought more if everyone bought into gme with this mindset i bet it would go to pluto easily if you sell at a loss you are donating to the save the short sellers fund out of your own wallet fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes and you’re not even following sound investment practice just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy if you’re thinking of investing so much that you’ll wuss out poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red just don’t emotion and the stock market do not mix well stop losses below purchase price are also for pansies and genuine idiots “i’ll sell you some stock but only if you give me a bad enough price on it” your plan should be to buy when the stock goes down if you feel like you need a stop loss youre investing more than you should instead of being stupid maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips side note personally in the case of gme i don’t have any limit sells either from what i can tell on past short squeezes the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down so as long as you keep an eye on gme when it actually does skyrocket you should have plenty of time set price alerts and relax no need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket midlaunch although if you want you can try to profit off gme volatility some people are getting shamed for taking profits but im not sure they deserve it as far as i know buying low and selling high doesn’t really help hfs it drives the price up just not as much as buying and holding but personally my philosophy is i can take baby profits anytime who knows when something like this gme rise will happen again so i’m holding 101 shares at cost average $106share want to get into the game now you could always just buy a few shares and keep the rest of what you’re willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip and buy a little bit more each time it goes down more bringing your cost average down ideally you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero always try to keep cash in reserve locked yourself in at a high price thats why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down didnt keep any cash in reserve guess youre stuck waiting for one of three things 1 the short squeeze which will likely though not certainly happen 2 for the price of gme to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases or 3 you get your hands on some more cash youre willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down do not sell at a loss and you will never lose edit well seldom if ever unless the company goes bankrupt a rare occurrence this is why you dont put all your eggs in one basket and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero it wont swallow your portfolio also if you truly fucked up and used money that you need for health insurance or something you may just have to back at least partially out with your tail between your legs and consider it a lesson hedge funds and billionaires know this thats why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic they bought the dip while regular folks paperhanded and got even poorer one more little trick if you manage to scoop up a nice juicy 100 shares then even if your position goes “underwater” you can always sell calls at above your average cost bring down your cost basis and make money off your stock “risk free” while still following the rule of never sell at a loss although if you did it right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen and youll need to be patient and like i said before say goodbye to your money for a while edit just to reiterate there are many trading strategies and i just feel this is one of the best for newbies trade however you want just don’t paper hand gme i would also note that you can sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price it still follows the rule of dont sell at a loss buy one share at $90 and sell it at $100 doesnt matter if you still have 100 shares in the red from earlier you can even slowly take your cost basis down by doing the thing where you buy a share when it goes down 5 and sell one when it goes up 5 edit yes i know about opportunity cost it does apply if you know something the general public doesn’t rare if you’re just a low iq ape but gme wasis an exception many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesnt it could be a coin flip whether youll hit rock bottom in an ideal world you can keep some money in reserve so you don’t have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities yes i know about and agree with the sunk cost fallacy my point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal lowering the cost basis not “doubling down” on sunk cost tldr 🦍buy 🍌 don’t give 🐍 🍌 unless 🐍 give more than 🦍pay for 🍌 not financial

lt89s3,on,12.04%,nrdrages friday dd the semis play not just the best you can do because of your low t that earned your wife a boyfriend trading chip shortages for top shelf tendies $on $mrvl $nxpi and a special surprise,dd,49,0.91,nrdrage,32,hi all nrdrage here you might remember from such recent hits as buy $pltr 25ps as its ripping here $clne june 13cs are literally free money sell your $nclh leaps in the 33 area and buy back later the next day near 29 youre welcome btw as that trade probably saved your week and $nvda june 580cs are going to make you rich today were gonna talk about the semiconductor chip space fluff content bbbbut nrdrage you called $nvda you already talked about them i really didnt be honest when i say chipssemis the first things you think of are $nvda $amd and $intc those are a wholly different thing than whats on everybodys lips these days in relation to the vaunted shortage dealing in high performance silicon that is being produced at full blast theyre not going to be given a ticket to the feed trough of free taxpayer money supposing somebody informs buyden that by chip shortage theyre not indicating he needs to send his interns to the snack aisle of the grocery store to hoard not a sure thing what were going to be talking about are the lower grade asic application specific chips that are used more in infrastructure these are the commodity level products that are used for things like the computers in vehicles mobile phones wireless towers specialized digital binary money mining and so elon can implant them in chimps for evil genius mind control experiments placeholder chart for expected 5g tower growth placeholder chart for automotive chip demands and supply bottleneck chart to q3 your bigger players here are going to be taiwan semi $tsmc lam $lrcx and st $stm 2 of them are boring to trade and lam im not allowed to talk about because of a conflict of interest w my vc lets talk about the government for a minute ok be honest half the reason youre here is because you heard buyden is going to dump loads of free money into these companies so theyll make more chips after all thats what cnbc has told you and they never lie right right thats actually not what has happened in washington and god help us that line about buyden thinking the chip shortage has to do with potatoes was only half joking what the government has done was signed up to spend money studying why theres a chip shortage the concern here is that even the us based semis outsource out their chip production to places like china and vietnam and theres a growing push to incentivize companies to bring production domestically this is especially spurred by $nxpi who is bottlenecking the automotive industry by selling too much overseas now lets be honest its about 75 that all they do is waste money on the study and never actually make the investment because getting things like this done is hard and its much easier to focus on social issues that are already covered by other laws but make it look like something is getting done we have talkers and not doers right now thats just the nature of the beast speaking of lets talk about $nxpi the laggard $nxpi represents the only true foreign company were going to examine today based in the netherlands $mrvl is technically based in bermuda but theyre a us company more on that later at the time of this writing theyre trading in the low 180s with a market cap of about 51 billion their specialty is in chips that power infotainment systems for cars so when you hear $f whine about how they cant get enough chips theyre lowkey throwing shade at $nxpi the only reason theyre being included in this list is because as a big automotive chipmaker in spite of the whole buy american virtuing from the current government if they spend money to ramp up manufacturing theyre going to hand money to $nxpi to set up factories here and will be dumb enough to not make it contingent upon $nxpi keeping the chips here in the country so theyll continue to sell them to the rest of the world looking under the hood 47 of their money comes from cars another 13 comes from phones 20 comes from infrastructure think wireless towers and about 20 of their money comes from selling chips to amazon and google so their virtual assistants can spy on you and listen to your wifes boyfriend having sex on your dining table with his balls rubbing right against where your plate of hungry man frozen dinners sits when he takes her out on a date she goes out with the girls hey i think one of those peas fell on the table pick it up and put it in your mouth yeah roll it around in there tastes like taint doesnt it theyre b asically a smaller representation of trevors nuts or a life size version of yours you dirty little bitch so one could say theyve got a pretty good product mix and were one of the earlier players in the sector to recover yet still lagged behind them overall unlike the other players were gonna talk about later or you could say that theyre a bunch of flip flopping noncommitters who create a schizophrenic company in some weird attempt to not be cyclical they trade at a lower multiple to their competitors but this is largely due to the fact that theyre leveraged more deeply than the rest the best comparison to these guys would be $txn if you want something else to track it by placeholder i might put a chart here later in an edit that compares price in relation to ebitda placeholder i might put a chart here later in an edit that shows forward earnings estimations based upon the increase in auto and iot chip costs what do they think theyre going to be long term thats the thing its impossible to tell if theyre going to become a big player in cars or iot theyre not compelling in infrastructure because what makes $nxpi interesting here in spite of the fact that everybody is pissed at them for spreading themselves too thin is the fact that theyre such whores with who they sell to that theyve become something of an interesting mampa speculative play as its entirely possible a company just comes along and buys them to bolster their supply chain for chips once and for all in particular there is a strong indication that samsung has been kicking the tires for over a year ok moving $on get it dad joke $on the overachiever $on represents the only true domestic semi on this list so if youre playing the corporate welfare trade youll be interested here if $nxpi is the bpdafflicted ex who loves strongly and thats why she lit your car on fire $on is that superfocused new girlfriend whos dating you because she knows somewhere in your contact list is a local celebrity she can use to get her closer to being the bachelorette after she dumps your ass on is allin on 2 things the vehicle revolution and 5g theyre positioning themselves as the place to go to if youre making evs or autonomous cars as they are focused on lidar sensory chips and power management why its simple on was is and always will be interested in the highest margin businesses possible cyclical nature of them be damned sure they stick the tip of their johnson in the industrial sector crossselling their sensory chips for purposes of machine vision think automated amazon warehouse part pickers but its not something they spend a lot of time on does this strategy work at least for right now lets look under the hood they had a massive beat last quarter and then upgraded forward guidance by 8 and this stonk has already had quite a run more than 30 to date which has outpaced its competitors by almost double the automotive section of their portfolio rose 17 and represents about 33 of their revenue at this point but its clear to see that if we have this conversation in a year that number will be well over 50 their infrastructure revenue wireless towers lagged but that was due to their vendors and actually represents a forward opportunity they beat in spite of a major part of their portfolio dumping so the answer is yes how simple mind control and cancer technology from the lizard people whos secret society is bustling under the ice of antarctica aka 5g the telecoms as a result of the virus really slowed down their rollout of 5g last year it was suspected that might carry through this year as well you may have noticed the news a day or two ago that $t and $vz caught downgrades because of unexpectedly high prices paid in the most recent bandwidth spectrum auctions that changes all of that since everybody had to pay so much more for the spectrum space look for these players to be very aggressive in trying to shorten the roi frame on those expenses by aggressively expanding out their 5g infrastructure there are 3 companies that this is very good news for $swks another stock i cant comment on because of conflict of interest so do your own dd with them $on and the next participant in this which well get to in a moment so there are about to be a lot more chips from $on in your kids school shooting ovarian cancer rays into that boy you likely wont see this reflected on the balance sheet until their q3 earnings but since everybody knows its coming its going to get baked into the price which is why youre very likely to see a melt up over the next months the one thing that sets $on apart from the rest of the equities on this list is that theyre not a a minifab that meaning theyre not a company that simply outsources chip production to other people overseas and who has shown a willingness to keep some production in house matter of fact their ceo recently came out and affirmed that he wants to maintain a balance between outsourcing and inhouse which means when its time to get some of that sweet sweet taxpayer money to build out us production theyll have their hands out tldr if youre bullish on evs selfdriving cars and the illuminati youre bullish on $on if youre playing the gubmint corporate cheese play $on $mrvl the duke brothers marvell is functionally a us company santa clara but is technically headquartered in bermuda because theyre filthy tax dodgers if youre one of those ethical investors stay far away from this company because theyre as dirty as they come in a lot of ways they also trade at a lower multiple than the others on the upside if the government starts offering money to build american sell to china they will elbow their way to the front of the line to take the free moneyand then build a 3 person operation somewhere in iowa that makes hard drive chips and pocket the rest which will definitely pad their bottom line one thing thats different with $mrvl here is that they completely outsource their chip production right now so if they were to take government money they would have to build their infrastructure from the ground up and figure out how to make it work anyways lets look under the hood 40 of their revenue comes from the storage sector meaning the lions share of their money is legacy selling chips that go in hard drives on the consumer side its in platter discs their ssd play is in the enterprise space because theyre not high performance chips booooooooooooooooriiiiiiiiing but nrdrage i can hear you saying that means theyre gonna be huge in the cloooooouuuuuuud sure except margins in t he cloud computing space keep shrinking at exponential rates as it becomes more commoditized so its a lot like investing in emc in 2014 theyve invested heavily in automotive in the last year but theyre a day late and a billion dollars short there it will take at least 3 years before that investment starts bearing fruit so theyre not an interesting play in that aspect and likely would use that free taxpayer money to try and close their gap there because they werent forward thinking in that regard theyve been active in acquisitions lately most recently buying inphi which serves to just attempt to keep up with $nvda in the arm chip space for data centers for the record they cannot keep up with $nvda in that space so dont think youre paying for a dominant player there its a high profit sector but not exciting and dependent on their continued contract winning in the whitebox space all this sounds like theyre big spenders but thats not really true theyve actually been excessively cautious in leveraging debt which is why theyre so far behind in the auto space as only 4 or 5 of their revenue came from things like industrial or iot mrvl is actively winding down t hose sectors of their business and abandoning t hem what they are thats interesting however is almost exclusively a 5g play and in that regard they are fucking rock stars 5g alone represents about a billion dollars per quarter as things get more heated there because theyre not just a domestic 5g play theyre really well positioned to be the dominant chip maker in both the land of the hentai sun and for the europoors if youre investing in $mrvl this is the sole reason youre doing so and its a compelling case theres no chart data i can provide asyet that can accurately project their positioning in the market in this area but rest assured when that data can be quantified theyre going to be a big time player in it matter of fact just yesterday they announced they were partnering with fujitsu in a 5g baseband agreement with regards to fujitsus base stations bad day to announce that news since the best performing stonks were the ones that only closed down 1 placeholder chart goes here for 5g chip earnings and market share placeholder chart goes here for telecom expansion analysis so to summarize the entire sector is very cyclical and presently it represents a perfect storm of an upgrade in telecommunications technology automotive advancements and iot dont bet on them just because you hear buyden is virtue signalling some bullshit about solving fords chip crisis because its probably going to be another example of lifetime politicians being all talk and no action theyre all healthy financially none of them are heavily shorted and pressure is to the upside albeit not in any sort of extreme adrenaline releasing way if you really want to bet on government the real bet here is the stimmy money getting handed out again dc is basically telling everybody to go buy a new phone with the next installment of checks and those phones are going to be 5g capable and the people are going to want to leverage that dont tell the lizard people i know about their secret base thats all well and good fucker but how do i play them can i fd $nxpi you actually can you can expect daily movement of between 24 with some regularity with a itm delta of about 58 and a gamma approaching 2 and a half spoiler alert all these are going to have garbage gammas just a nature of the industry dont go crazy out of the money but weeklies are absolutely something you can do here $on you cant really this is really more of a melt up play you dont necessarily have to play leaps but weeklies are gonna be a bad idea stay close to in the money and go 2 or 3 months out at a time currently im sitting on 416 41cs which i will roll over into june calls as we get closer to expiration you always want to stay a little in front of these dudes itm delta is almost always sub50 and gamma is often times about 12 short term stay a little ahead of them and it improves dramatically $mrvl theyre ok there but like $on youre probably going to want to stay ahead of them though you can fiddle with this a bit delta is pretty good but the gamma is absolute dogshit if you target something about 10 one direction or another you should be happy as long as you pick the right side of the coin flip outlook and price targets $nxpi im neutral on them bordering on bullish theyre the biggest reason we keep hearing about this silicon crisis right now but theyre being coy about whether the reason theyre not keeping up is because they dont or wont produce enough or if its just because they wont sell enough to us they represent a potential speculative play if somebody who really needs chips for their business decides to just solve the problem by throwing money at it and bringing that development in house 3 month price target 200210 $on bullish theyre laser focused and well positioned to take advantage of all the highest margin business in this cycle and as the demand for these products ramps up their outlook is going to exponentially outpace everybody else in the space even the chips i didnt talk about today exempting gaming chip makers 45 in the short term but if you manage to stick your dick in your wife when shes sleeping one night and dribble your downsafflicted swimmers into her you could very well see 7580 by the time that chromosome hoarding bundle of joy licks your wifes vag i expect to see this one in triple digits at some point a darling $mrvl bullish for 5g only once you start seeing the telecoms advertise theyve got 97 nationwide 5g coverage and research studies to back that up their cycle will be over and theyll go back to legacy revenue but expect big things from them as $t and $vz try to keep up with tmos breakneck pace short term price of $75 long termeh whatever positions $nxpi i dont hold a position with them and dont anticipate doing so unless a strong momentum trade forms i think they can move but theyre not interesting to me some of you will like them especially since you can fd them because of the occasional spikes and craters $on 1000 416 $41cs and 500 716 44cs i also have 85000 shares at 3059 i grabbed some weeklies for next week at 38 during yesterdays bloodbath but that was just me feeling cute you cant really shadow trade that since its already back up to 4025 $mrvl 2000 521 $65cs and 50000 shares at 3335 nrdrage double feature bonus dd $utz i keep making those buyden hears chip shortage and thinks frito lay is in trouble jokes but the thing is im only half kidding that has nothing to do with this equity other than it got me thinking about my favorite snack brands a week ago i had no idea this company was even publicly traded i always knew them as a family run northeast niche thing one thing i did notice however was a couple of years ago their chips started showing up in grocery stores near my colorado homes which i had been assuming meant they were having things shipped from the east coast and when we spent a couple of weeks at our la home recently so i could get in some motorcycle riding and away from the snow i found them on the shelves out there too somewhere along the way they decided to become a national brand and have started penetrating markets all over the place i have no idea what their financials look like or any other solid dd besides knowing that theyre fucking delicious and if youre a believer in the product then believing in the company shouldnt be hard so i bought a thousand shares at 2435 in solidarity with them then i saw cramer hyped them a couple of nights ago and cursed myself for starting to turn into a shitty boomer maybe they become a big player in the snack food space on their own maybe a company like $pep comes along and buys them out regardless if you like the product go out and buy some equity you fat fuck plus theres always a nonzero chance joe gives them a bailout by mistake ampx200b all my love ampx200b chad

lt8r61,rkt,9.74%,the post earnings rkt play rocket to the moon tendie time,dd,499,0.94,sidemen-ultimate-fan,284,tldr rkt is going to bull run all the way to the 9th march after its beautiful earnings and its time to burn some shorts yesterday preearnings i posted some ddhttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentslsdpuzrkttothemoonddandshortsqueezeopportunity on why rkt rocket companies was a buy i was right the earnings were a blowout and at time of writing the stock sits up 10 from highs of a 20 gain during the day to someone that has not followed rkt this may seem like a missed opportunity wrong welcome to the amazon of the finance world well near enough rocket by all traditional measures shouldve risen to $25 previous close of $1990 minimum today their undoing was their own lack of volatility in the past practically since the ipo institutions and savvy retail traders alike have sold calls some covered some not to either make a decent return on the stock stuck between $19 and $21 or to average down from a bag holding position above these players had a huge amount to lose today from a massive price increase a potential gamma squeeze if it did so hence they have done everything in their power alongside weak hands to keep the price below $22 next week things start to change but before that lets just go over the insane earnings they just report 1 eps $109 analyst prediction $087 an insane beat and a rise in quarter net income from $754 million to $284 billion 2 a special dividend of $111 per share to class a common stock holders on march 9th note this is important autists 3 partnerships with a multitude of companies including jp morgan 4 stock buyback not taken place yet but still intended 5 theres more little nuggets but thats enough for ape brain to take in so what happens next week firstly the dividend at current stock price is just over 5 yield an insane amount this provides a catalyst for the price in two ways firstly who doesnt want any easy 5 return this is hardly priced in lets be realistic these earnings give rkt as pe of 5 way below industry average if you consider them a financial stock and around 3 to 4 times too small if you consider them a fintech more importantly lets have a look at rkts short interest it lies somewhere between 35 and 40 now lets be clear this isnt going to be a reddit retail investor driven short squeeze rkt has a mkt cap of 40ish billion not 400 million but if long institutions pile in we could potentially see a lot of upwards pressure shorts have to pay the dividend an instant 5 loss is not a good look and who knows if therell be more to come in later earnings with call holders less in the equation the shorts have lost one of their biggest allies its time to make them pay for dogging this stock since the ipo everyone on here knows what happens when shorts have to cover and 40 of the float having to cover sounds pretty damn good to me a huge difference between rkt and other meme stocks is that the price could stay above $30 indefinitely or higher shorts dont like to be stuck indefinitely losing unlike holding other meme stocks which they expect eventually to collapse not that they will unless you all have weak hands expect raving analyst upgrades all next week hopefully around $30 to drive the price up more with all this in mind expect a huge run up to the 9th of march i have a genuine pt after that earnings of $40 but if the wind blows in our rocket ships favour the moon is only the beginning this rocket is going up uranus like your wifes boyfriends is up hers rocket is recruiting diamond hands i am sure retail investors helped the shorts today by bagging their lame 10 profit but autists and apes we can get 100 200 or more rkt closed at $2185 today it is my firm believe rkt is a brilliant buy after these earnings under $24 and if the bull run starts all the way to $30 management want these shorts out and thats good enough for me the ceo laughed at the shorts on cnbc i am willing to put my money where my mouth is as i averaged up from $30 per cent equivalent cfd contracts at $2030 to $41 per cent equivalent at $2091 in other words get us to $46 because this autist wants his first 100k trade these values are actually gbp but i presumed you only know dollar due to autism i just like the stock so buy shares squeeze shorts rkt to the moon earnings call transcripthttpswwwfoolcomearningscalltranscripts20210226rocketcompaniesincrktq42020earningscalltra edit very important point some people have pointed out the float is actually around 100 million shares as 95 is held by insiders in a holding company which puts the tradeable mkt cap at around 3 billion not far off gme just more reason to buy disclaimer this is not financial advise and should not be taken as such sec scares me ampx200b

ltagot,the,n/a,why the squeeze has not been squoze,dd,2867,0.94,homedepothank69,726,bear with me apes this is gonne be a long one technical similarities compared to last time if you look at the volume activity 113 – 119 there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump it’s actually big but it’s gme we’re talking about so i’m speaking in relative terms then volume decreases and the price levels off then on january 21 friday we gme have the biggest volume its ever had in a day however this only raised the price to about $70 the next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150 then on jan 27 and 28 that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days after that we all know what happened now compare that price and volume action to now and i think we have something similar i think that this week’s price action and potentially next week’s and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 113119 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled offstabilized another thing to see is that the macd on the 1year chart just had a bullish convergence for those of you autists who don’t know what that is it means that the price action has started a bullish trend the last time it did that on the 1year chart was in early january when the squeeze was taking form it’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation because of how option expiry works fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options so that’s why today was pretty red although not horribly expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind similar market conditions look at market conditions from last time compared to this time spx down massively vix up massively then and now do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when jpow promised no rate hikes for at least a year fuck no it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover gme shorts conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time the short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting some sites say it’s 41 which is still huge others say its 1520 the issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month so most of this data is reflective of the postsqueeze when short interest was lower however fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now this leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson and that once it is updated we will see that short interest is back up skyhigh yeah i bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this the overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest possibly massive short interest and that many funds still have not covered from last time the borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly httpsiborrowdeskcomreportgmehttpsiborrowdeskcomreportgme this is exactly what happened last time and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need just as a little side bar also look at amc its also repeating the same pattern as gme is this because amc has the same short interest propositions as gme probably not i think that amc just rises with gme but this is just another interesting similarity to last time rh as i said above the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it i would bet that rh and other firms will not restrict buying this time unless it goes above 1k because a they are much more liquid as of now and b they do not want another one of these press nightmares obviously if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again but i think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time i also just wanna point out that the ceo of interactive brokers even said on cnbc that the price of gme would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying so don’t underestimate our power i just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they will undoubtedly have to restrict again whether this is their fault or not so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true however we could easily see it jump to 4 figures if what im saying comes to fruition if you are not suprised when gme goes up above 500 do not be suprised when brokerages ass ram you short interest last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100 this time it seems to be about 40 but these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher therefore there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time however because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40 which would still lead to a massive jump potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 otm calls what i tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0 if this is the case that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting because they don’t update often sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update in this situation however the short interest is not as important as the options activity how otm calls can multiply this the reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive otm calls that became itm meaning they had to buy more shares however at the time the most otm strike was something like 200300 eventually getting up to over 500 now because of the last squeeze we have otm calls with strikes of 800 this means if the price keeps going up there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time like i said above a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float unless the numbers are inaccurate but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover which could trigger a small short squeeze catalysts one of the most important things that i’ve learned about gme over the past few months is how wsb reacts to its catalysts this stock has showed us that it reacts very strongly to catalysts specifically ones dealing with ryan cohen and leadership as we know the first one was triggered by cohen becoming a large owner of gme this current one was triggered by the cfo being ousted and partially by cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone as andrew left from shitron said he thinks that gme should dilute some shares and make an acquisition this would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket we also have the possibility of ryan cohen making more moves such as hires appointing himself ceo acquisitions more tweets etc most of all we have earnings on march 25 thankfully after hours which is when this thing likes to jump i’m gonna take a guess and say that cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively i believe that is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short gamma squeeze this would happen the next day march 26 that also perfectly coincides with the end of the month which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super otm calls which could trigger a gamma squeeze quite honestly because of wsb interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock i could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month the point the point of this is that it’s not fucking over this squeeze will likely take longer than the first one but could easily be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad this article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short httpsinvestorscultcom20210226gmeshortsqueezehttpsinvestorscultcom20210226gmeshortsqueeze the diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation but just know that these fuckers still have a ton of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze if we know anything it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up ie 2008 and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until gme goes to zero or until wsb puts the funds to zero stay strong apes if the stock goes past 800 my wife’s boyfriend has promised to let me sleep in the garage instead of under the deck i’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice i’m just a dude with a small penis edit wow thank you for all of the replies i completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the etfs especially xrt that makes me even more bullish on this if gme continues to rise these etfs will have to buy more gme to balance becuase of the increased value this is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price i also loved the comments about all of the artificialphantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100 shorter however this all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this why are they trying to push it down so much if this is out of rage from last time or if theyre still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time then they still clearly havent learned and that again makes me think that this is all far from over finally our lord and savior dfv has 500 call options expiring april 16th $12 strike so not a shot in hell these are ever otm 100 chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys and probably buys more optionsstock which will just provide more upward momentum i truly believe that the hf are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage for those of you who say “hf won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” 20072008 has entered the chat like i said i think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one but could easily be bigger i cant emphasize enough how important i think the earnings call catalyst will be be strong apes dont get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong there’s some shady stuff going down god this is intimate i feel like i’m financially inside of you or something im jacked right now im jacked to the tits ill be reporting back

lteecj,gme,304.17%,gme may have the potential to dictate the course of the entire market i did some research amp analysis,dd,6942,0.96,ar334,1484,before i start i just want to say i am writing this because last time i put up speculative dd and people were tearing it apart because it was very generalized being that i have a scientific background i decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one i hope some of you find it meaningful and i would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism hypothesis gme is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market new york stock exchange nya market cap $229 trillion 2400 stock listings nasdaq ixic market cap 3300 listings sampp 500mc $3161 trillion dow jones industrial average djia market cap $833 trillion 30 largest of nya and nasdaq tldrabstract i compare the relationship between gme and the worlds largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical ytd quotes the data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between gme and both the nya and djia the data didn’t suggest that there is a significant relationship between ixic and gme but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship as gme rises the market responds by dropping based on this data my prediction is that wsb and gme holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market if this data is accurate then gme can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently possibly help for not just gme indicators but also prospective market strategiespositions in short when gme goes up the market goes down tldr for data i found that the nya djia and ixic are negatively correlated to gme nya nyap 0027 djia p 0018 nasdaq p 088 start i noticed that anytime gme is rallying up my entire portfolio goes red my thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle gme the whole entire market falls as a result however whenever i mentioned this idea i’ve been met with opposition so i decided to compare the gme to the market indices i mentioned above ampx200b gme djia ixic nya ytd datahttpspreviewredditijpbroximxj61pngwidth1251ampformatpngampautowebpamps479499bdf91390cd98ed099bf963ab656421f695 if you look at the chart big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in gme price meaning while the whole market collapses gme rises the opposite is also true as gme drops the rest of the market rises the trends based on these comparisons suggest that gme is to some degree controlling the entire market i decided to use some statistics so i can see the likelihood that these are “coincidences” as many have suggested process i calculated covariance correlation and p test matrices based on ytd data from yahoo finance of gme nya djia ixic all data can be found there ampx200b covariance amp correlation matriceshttpspreviewredditmsw9tittmxj61pngwidth364ampformatpngampautowebpampse1b76728b60bb58ae1b42c40ee3c0c6de3e80553 p values statistically significant values highlightedhttpspreviewredditgwdaxycymxj61pngwidth360ampformatpngampautowebpampscd89e780bd3a85713d72d6e7a94b249d166c3fd0 the results show that there is clear covariance between gme and all of the markets i mentioned the correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between gme and the markets but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices but what was most important was the p values between gme and the nyadjia for those that are not into statistics the pvalue is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on “luck” or “chance” it is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance any pvalue less than 05 is considered statistically significant a pvalue less than 05 basically says that there is less than a 5 chance that the relationships are due to “luck” as you can see there is a 27 chance that the nya dropping is random and a 18 chance for the djia while the ixic does not fit the bill i believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing nya to ixic or when comparing djia to ixic so what does this mean my opinions to me this means that gme does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uberrich but rather a battle for the entire market on january 26 the djia dropped 600 points the ixic 300 points and nya 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in gme imagine what would happen if gme hit a thousand dollars at this point you may be worried that gme may impact the whole market and while that should initially cause worry when you remember the fact that the top 10 own 88 of the entire market you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted its theirs my opinion is that if the short squeeze happens we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen but larger than any society in history has ever seen that liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market final thoughts disclaimers anyway this is just something i wanted to share not trying to convince anyone to do anything to buy anything or not to buy anything none of this is a fact it is vulnerable to error and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it i would love feedback especially if there are any statisticians out there i also want to clarify that this was based on limited ytd data i tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff if anyone has access to quality data i would love to sink my teeth into it i am not a financial advisor edit wow i am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement i received from the community thank you all so much i also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis specifically about the one that goes along the lines of correlation does not imply causation there is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality correlation is a measure for the strength of a relationship meaning it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable in a statistical context the term significant is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective it carries mathematical weight which is established by the ptest the ptest essentially measures the likelihood that the correlation between 2 variables is unrelated meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck if you look on the labels of nutrition items if in the corner of a claim you see a little it means that statement was deemed statistically significant for instance vitamin b 12 claims helps turn food into cellular energy while other vitamins make claims with no in laymans terms the ptest with regards to gme and nya basically says that according to the data provided there is a 27 chance that the two are unrelated or a 9973 chance they are related in the scientific community anything below 5 or less than 05 is considered statistically significant also i didnt just test correlation i also tested covariance covariance is not the same as correlation covariance measures the direction of the relationship in this case the very large negative values are indicative of an inverse relationship meaning when one goes up the other one goes down so with that in mind this analysis provides a measure for the direction of the relationship the strength of the relationship and the statistical significance of the relationship apart from that it does not say why or how they related that is purely speculation and i clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data i am not convincing you to buy into mine lastly ive seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data all i have to say is that i spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of 500 dollarshttpsfirstratedatacomcb1completeusstocksindexetffutures per data set not to mention a bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year if someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and i will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it other than that thank you all so much for the support and awards edit 2 the first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility ubigboolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between gme and djia he got a correlation coefficient of 053 which is close to mine of 049 ubigboolean graphhttpspreviewreddituu51ljdpsyj61jpgwidth600ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps23556405c1362f35eab8932dca9927ff9b075c69 for those who would like to help reproduce or

ltpnrj,hf,n/a,why melvin and the other hf’s basically have no chance of winningimo,discussion,2062,0.93,upper_piano1809,471,there is only one answer as to how on earth 140 shorting was allowed this is due to the concept of naked shorting this in simple terms is when shorters like big institutions like melvin decide to short the stocks without locating the stock holders basically meaning they are shorting without caring about if their shorts match the supply of holders and this lead to 140 shorting which lead to phantom shares this is all highly illegal except for one exception to the best of my belief youtube it and read up on the sec to confirm otherwise don’t believe me an exception to which the government will turn the check is when naked short selling a company that results in bankrupt by which they end up making big amounts of profit why does this even matter it’s because through these phantom shares they are able to manipulate the ‘failure to deliver’ system in the stock market and so through manipulating these failure to delivers they trick the algorithm into having to adjust a sell off they do this to trick us and to make us actually fear and cause a real sell off they belief this hype is temporary that will pass they do not realise that we are not cats that are not playing around no more think about it no honestly think about iteveryone was gunning for $1000 the way in which we are all diamond handing this hold then why would a natural sell off occur only half way it’s because of market manipulation caused by the restrictions of being able to buy shares the news media penetrating that the interest in gme was over and these failure to deliver and ladder attacks the majority of us are still holding holding through 80 and didn’t sell when it went down why well it’s simple its because the squeeze has not been squoze now back to naked short selling this is market manipulation at its finest but of course gamestop is no longer dead through the great help of ryhan cohen’s and wsb the giant has been revived once more meaning that there is inevitable death for the hf’s as long as we manage to hold shorting requires for interests to have to be paid in order to keep the position open which means that if we hold on long enough we will absorb melvin dry the more hype there is the more these interests go up and that’s our key to pulling off a wicked gamma squeeze like nothing seen before usit’s a great time to be alive and although it may appear on screen that short interest is back under the 100 mark i think that the final 40 of shorts won’t be able to be deductible since it’s made up of phantom shares melvins and all the other hedgefunds only way to succeed was for them to pull this short off in the shadows without anyone realising this stock has been shorted for years but that plan has now epically failed so now they know they have no choice but to use any dirty tactics they can to divide and conquer through any and every manipulation tactics that exist it’s corruption vs the people unity will prevail if we stay strong together 💎 hold my diamond apes our promised day is near 💎🚀📈📈📈📈📈📈📈 disclaimer this is not financial advice this is merely the thoughts of a smooth brained ape so i honestly don’t want you to believe anything i said i don’t know what i’m talking about and i’m smoking on crayons as we speak the purpose was to point you to the right directions and now i want you to do your own research about naked short selling implications and verify if i am correct to the best of my ability i do believe what i said is right but like i said i’m a smooth brained ape so i could be wrong there’s really only one way to know and that’s for you to do your own research take my thoughts with a pinch of salt,2021-02-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltpnrj/why_melvin_and_the_other_hfs_basically_have_no/
lts4ip,pbr,3.28%,due diligence post petrobras pbr,dd,14,0.65,caiusgnome,36,this post is the sharing of my due diligence for petrobras ticker pbr aka pabst blue ribbon after their most recent q4 2020 results from thursday february 25 2021 here are the important facts in my opinion 1 cash flow from operations during the three months ended 123120 was $71 billion usd this represents 14 of their market capitalization during one quarter in q1 2021 i expect it will be at least $10 billion if not more that means if they took the cash on hand at 123120 of $13 billion plus their cash flows from operations during just the fiscal 2021 year they could buy back more than 100 of their current market cap of common stock 2 their stock tends to move in conjunction with oil prices and also the brl local currency compared to the us dollar so when the us dollar is weaker the stock goes up over the past 2 months the us dollar has increased against the brl by about 12 pushing the pbr stock price down during that time i believe with the us stimulus about to pass that this trend will reverse back significantly 3 the recent news on monday regarding the replacement of the current ceo of pbr with a retired general was due to complaints about diesel fuel the stock dropped approximately 25 due to this news when you review the financials you can see in q4 2020 that $37 billion of the $139 billion of revenues relates to diesel fuel this is about 25 of the revenues of the company however the discounts that the government is asking pbr to make will not eliminate the revenue it will potentially cause maybe a 10 reduction so this in effect is only a reduction of revenue by 25 also the board of directors has refused to allow this discount so far therefore i believe the 25 stock price decline is much steeper than the effect to the company revenues of 25 4 the tech industry is declining as interest rates rise investors are in the process of moving into reopening stocks and commodity stocks in 2021 therefore this is a tailwind for pbr especially considering that biden wants to shut down oil production in the usa which will further increase the price of oil and will not affect pbr in any way as brazil doesnt restrict the oil exploration function in brazil in the same way that biden wants to in the usa so there will be no impairments on pbrs balance sheet like there will be on the usa companies should biden decide to ban certain oil properties from permitting 5 technically the stock found support on monday february 22 2021 at $780 per share and bounced higher on friday february 26 2021 the stock did not cross below $785 even when the market was moving lower therefore there is strong support at this level my recommendation is first to review the news and financials on the sec website regarding pbr then i recommend purchasing shares of the company under ticker pbr if you want to increase exposure i also recommend purchasing longdated call options at the $8 $9 and $10 levels for either january 2022 or january 2023 httpspreviewredditi0ad4y48z1k61jpgwidth725ampformatpjpgampautowebpampsce4577a6750feb017a03ef1e558b1a626abdaa32,2021-02-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lts4ip/due_diligence_post_petrobras_pbr/
ltszy8,root,-30.00%,story and dd on root inc $root – the unknown sibling of $lmnd and why i believe it will jump up relatively soon,dd,36,0.78,shandowarden,41,first i am not a financial analyst or am i here to advise on what to do here to just share my personal insights for discussionentertainment purposes only i sat quite some time writing this mini article up so at least do not downvote my effort thanks tldr and tldr of tldr at the bottom second – what is root inc and what do they do root insurance company provides car insurancehttpsenwikipediaorgwikicarinsurance to drivers in 30 us states root requires drivers to download their mobile apphttpsenwikipediaorgwikimobileapp and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background if the driver passes the driving test they are offered a premiumhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiinsurancepremium which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies root offers a discount to tesla owners who drive using autosteerhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiteslaautopilotautosteer mode making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a semiautonomous vehiclehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiautonomouscarsemiautomatedvehicles in 2020 root had its initial public offeringhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiinitialpublicoffering ipo where shares sold at $27 each raising $7244 million which was the largest ipo in ohio history now after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13 httpspreviewredditvbxtfuld22k61jpgwidth624ampformatpjpgampautowebpampsfbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292 as you can see above this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released they all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars it got swept hard due to no momentum due to no interest in the stock then – shorted the shit out of it now in the lows undervalued bound to recover – worst case is neutral third sibling of lemonade stock root is a tech company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for root to have to payout insurance claims the great thing is all root customers install the app on their phone and it tracks their driving allowing root to collect more data and improve its model increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car this model is unique and gives root a high moat as well as high potential market share lemonade is an insurance company like root except they are not a tech company their business model is just traditional reinsurance the only thing tech about them is the fact the ui on their website looks good so this brings me to my next point valuations lemonade as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company they have a quarter yes a quarter of roots sales 97mil vs 402mil respectively and a higher marketcap somehow 655b vs 458b respectively now these evaluations would make sense if lemonade were a tech company and root was not it would make sense if lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies but no it is literally the same as every other insurance company while root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like lemonade should have been this text was a quote from a reddit user upeepeeecksdee in one of his posts what is their current situation ampx200b httpspreviewreddittblgfbtg22k61jpgwidth392ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99

cheap price their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$ down to 14$ then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50 to 129$ first time it was around their first earnings december 1st the stock plummeted to shits and went from i believe 1718 to 14 the exact same situation happened now it went all across down to 129 and ended up the final day in the up 13s both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee but a huge amount of shares i also preview an image from their statistics of shares 14 shares floated 40 held by institutions right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid19 and having to drop premiums and plans they reported an ok quarter but i would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which i will briefly mention below optionsputs httpspreviewreddits2y394jj22k61jpgwidth624ampformatpjpgampautowebpamps590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598 now i do not play or analyze options of callsputs nor do i believe i have a decent knowledge of it but what i can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate i expect puts to be already exercised and closed most of them bet the stock will slide down to 125 the most while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$ now we are literally in the lowest point possible we still have some open contracts for late march where people bet it will be at 15 17 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before april when shares unlock next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks i do not expect a rapid price change but a bit green color is to be seen volume because of the immense shorting that happened on friday i believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down now i am no expert but i did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where if the stock was shorted oversold etc it rebounded days andor weeks after i share the images below what happened on friday is a huge selloff and shorting typically this stock trades at 1525 mil per day on friday we saw over 8 million of shares being soldbought

worth it to buy well we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios first of all as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known root sucks at marketing even lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their ipo they cut expenses they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available they also have 30 states in their contracts but have not yet acquired new york and i believe not sure about this one california some other states as well the competition in insurance business is quite strong difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road q4 report and team guidance so basically what will you get from reading the transcript well quite literally they are in the weeds little weeds maybe moderate they are battling losses and licking up their wounds planning out future funds and revenues marketing they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses but expect to doubletriple expenses in the future but what i did like very much is their team and analysis these guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be expenses to be gains to be literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay worst case scenario this will bounce back after covid19 overall entire industry of insurance is some of transcripts you read are mostly reports on earnings revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever look at $spce transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price market cap guidance is key and in most scenarios i believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part to me it said that basically look we are aware that covid19 drilled our asses but we have a plan nothings changed we met our metrics and stayed on course this was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago i believe a rebound is soon to happen link

guidance tldr root inc is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services they got left behind the hype of lemonade and never got to the same scale tobeknownwise this stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50 last time this happened it bounced back to nearoriginal price immediately in a week they got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later i see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 1314 dollars line i believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 1314 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15 17 20 dollars i would buy shares calls for midlate march expiry recovery and puts for april share lockup ends share price now good for both short term and long term which i like a lot tldr of tldr all time low strong resistance line does not look like a falling knife short percentage big volume more than 400 on friday – bound to

ltudu7,gme,303.60%,gme dd why the volkswagen comparison is much more inaccurate than you thought but in a different way,dd,1633,0.95,ununimportant-,441,hey folks i’m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers but over the last few days i’ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant vw comparisons we’ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying gme performance but actually underplaying it apologies for the lack of rockets but i’m not writing this on a phone have fun with all the text so the vw short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for gme with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance there seemed to be a very common response to these vw shills which was often along the lines of “well yeah there are more gme shares shorted than there were vw shares but since the effective gme float is whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares again reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago significantly larger than the 1 or so of vw shares there was in effect the 13 short interest on vw led to a 131 shortfloat ratio meanwhile gme would by nature of its much larger float have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far far greater short interest math 101 i accepted this for the last few weeks but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example i came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned tldr you can cover infinite short positions with one real share as long as you make an infinite number of transactions but you can only cover one naked short position with the one created counterfeit share let’s explain that for those that don’t immediately get the logic imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted vw presumably the vast majority if not all of the shorts executed went the following way you start with 0 shares you borrow one from a broker you now have 1 shares you sell that share completing your short you now have 0 shares now imagine the short squeeze happens and let’s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each the thing is you can buy a share off the market returning your total to 1 shares before you return it to 0 shares by giving it to your broker your broker can now sell that share to other shorts and they to other shorts etc the point being when working with real shares an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts while still driving the price up now here’s the kicker which has been tormenting me over the last few days as i try not to get my hopes too high imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund named delvin capital you go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting you start with 0 shares you do not borrow one from your broker you sell a “share” promising to fulfill the step you just skipped “sometime soonish maybe” you now have 1 shares now the squeeze happens as above but this time the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned and also made naked short positions notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy you buy that one share off the market to cover your short notice your total is not positive but only 0 since you were actually negative to begin with thus you can’t give these shares to your broker or another fund since doing so would only return you to a negative value the point being naked shorts unlike normal pg13 shorts have what is effectively a 11 cover ratio the whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is as far as i can reason impossible maybe that’s why they haven’t squeezed yet here’s where vw vs gme comes back in though gme’s nominal institutional ownership is over 100 furthermore with all the recently unearthed etf shorts added in gme shorts are pretty obviously over 100 when you consider that with retail not even factored into the equation this 11 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts their desperation seems to have been if anything undervalued this whole time the only way they can cover naked shorts is buy repurchasing an almost identical number of shares and it is this fact that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist without trading the same ones back and forth which makes this fucking crazy assuming retail and bullish institutions hold it is not just exceedingly costly but impossible for them to cover if you’ve gotten this far congratulations now think about that again effective tldr 20 people asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule probably pretty fucking high vw may be a good example but here’s my question what will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it vw is definitely not a good example if anything it’s an understatement i think this is what actually makes gme something we’ve never ever seen before in all of financial history please reflect on this and correct me if i’m wrong i hope i’m not joy to all unimportant this is not financial advise and i am not a financial

ltw8nt,rad,5.30%,right time for rite aid rad,dd,36,0.79,michael_therami,69,this analysis looks at one possible breakup scenario of the rite aid corporation that projects a return of more than 25x the closing share price of $1958 on friday february 26 2021 rite aid rad consists of two 2 parts 1 the retail pharmacy business currently generating approximately $16 billion in annual revenues 2 the prescription benefits management pbm services business known as elixir currently generating approximately $8 billion in annual revenues one possible scenario for unlocking the value of rad involves the sale of the retail pharmacy business and rite aid brand what is left is the elixir pbm organization here is an estimation of how such an approach might play out in 2018 walgreens acquired 1923 rite aid stores for $44 billion in cash that represents an average price of $2275 million per store should rad seek a buyer for its retail pharmacy business it could sell its 2450 remaining stores as well as the rite aid brand despite the fact that many of these stores are located in highly attractive locations ca oh ma md nj ny pa va etc lets discount the average value of each store by 20 compared to the average priceperstore paid by walgreens and arrive at a relatively conservative estimate of $18 million per store at a average price of $18 million per store rad could reasonably generate proceeds of $44 billion with the sale of the entire retail pharmacy business including the 2450 locations and the rite aid brand name assigning no good will value to the brand the remaining rad organization essentially consists of a pbm branded as elixir and a net amount of cash on hand of $12 billion assuming that $32 billion of the retail pharmacy sale proceeds are used to pay down the entire existing longterm debt on the companys books elixirs projected sales for rads fiscal year 2021 ending february 2021 are approximately $8 billion during each of the past four 4 quarters rad has reported elixirs yearoveryear growth rate to be in the range of 23 29 elixirs projected ebitda for fiscal 2022 begining march of 2021 will likely be approximately $200 million once again i am taking a conservative estimate and basically considering that a business that has grown 23 29 each quarter for the past year will suddenly see little to no growth in the upcoming year with only 55000000 shares outstanding today the $200 million ebitda generated by elixir translates to roughly $360 per share in earnings using a highly conservative pe multiple of 8 a stock price of $2880 results however the cashonhand of $12 billion from the sale of the retail pharmacy business after longterm debt payoff produces additional value of $2200 per share resulted in a stock price value of more than $50 per share which is more than 25x the closing price of $1958 on friday february 26 2021 the newly created company elixir would be wellpositioned for growth in the smalltomidsize opportunity segment of the $400 billion per year pbm industry with a net $12 billion in cash that future growth could be achieved both organically as well as through acquisition in conclusion this analysis indicates that the conservative value of rad today is $50 per share well above the current share price being attributed to the organization by the market which is just under $20 the purpose of this post is not to suggest that a breakup of the rite aid corporation is the best strategic path forward i personally believe that the company has the potential to generate a price per share north of $100 in the next 12 24 months if it keeps the entire organization fully in tact rather the purpose of the post was to reveal the hidden value locked within rad that is clearly being overlooked by the investment community by analyzing one possible breakup scenario,2021-02-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltw8nt/right_time_for_rite_aid_rad/

losers bidu xpev on a milk carton but our family still has hope jd i use barchart and tos for general flow but use unusual whales scanner for most of my uoa picks shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that i’m playing update docu ceo speaking at morgan stanly tmt conference monday am this 300c 35 came through last weekhttpsiimgurcomdd2cqvpjpg suicidal strike but i like the sentiment when the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling im in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough why because the moment i buy a put we are going to new alltime highs i just know it so ive had to work a little harder to pull out the calls and im happy for those of you that got the spot snap and ba tendies from last weeks dd xpev was kind of weird tooi guess i need to take buy american honestly ill take 355 for picks on a bloody week any day though please remember when things are this volatile choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction after the first hour of the day minimum unless were playing a specific event the difference between a failing play and a 30 intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open or buying two hours later and dont get greedythis is guerilla warfare right now take your pop profits unless you have pdt restriction in which case go tighter to the strike and much longer than the whale if you can’t afford it don’t play it there are opportunities every day anyway i want to go in a little different direction this week as something interesting stood out to me ready lets roll 1 the spot whale anatomy of a carcass on monday as i dined on spot tendies while the world burned around me i was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses on sunday afternoon after the dd was written some further research revealed that at 8 am on monday 222 spot was hosting an “investor day” investor day was indeed the whales bet and boy did it pay off with that 8 intraday pop i hadnt heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit so my spidey sense was tingling then the next interesting hits came last weeks whales to watch had snap picked as another play to follow based on otm call activity and repeat betting on tuesday and wednesday amidst the storm snap indeed went nuts with intraday pops twtr which id made a note of the week prior had the same activity what was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together investoranalyst days it was time to get to work 2 the investigation i wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just havent paid much attention to the results were interesting in two ways 1 snaphttpsinvestorsnapcomoverviewdefaultaspx spothttpsinvestorsspotifycomhomedefaultaspx and twtrhttpsinvestortwitterinccomeventsandpresentationsdefaultaspx investor relations pages show these events in 2021 but not in 2020 or 2019 earnings sure annual meetings indubitably conferences yes investoranalyst days nay small sample size obviously but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two yearsid call it significant 2 snap spot and twtr investoranalyst days all came shortly after their earnings reports this is important later snap er was 24 investor day was 223 spot er was 25 investor day was 222 twtr er 29 analyst day was 225 all three of these tickers had otm whale bets with expirations the week of the investoranalyst events all three of these came within a month of their er all three of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just thatpump note i did some quick searching of recent pumped tech and pypl employed the same strategy no investor day in 2020 yet after their er on 2321 they hosted an investor day on 211 these companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said we are having a virtual event where we are going to paump our brains out 3 defining rambo as i continued to poke around i saw more and more similar examples simple searches of otm whale activity for specific dates on the tickers which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations conferences and meetings on their corporate sites gives valuable input for what may be brewing i also saw that morgan stanley is hosting its annual technology media and telecom conferencehttpsesnnetmorganstanleytechnologymediaandtelecomconferencemarch12021 among others our favorite fsly is set to present 😬 😉 given that these plays coincide with investor relations meetingsconferences and are blatant pumps i’ll refer to it as rambo relations and meeting buy opportunities 4 theorizing recent increases of rambo what stuck out to me was that these recent tech rambos were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports spot if youre going to change the world with podcasts in sierra leone or whatever why not announce it during the er you had a couple weeks priorbefore the same can be asked of others like pypl snap twtr etc my theory is that the current er environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10000 estimate beat means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards in a way they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time after seeing the success of this manuever this past week i wouldnt be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day analyst day or key meetingconference 5 so what am i saying im saying that given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions we are likely to see an uptrend in otm whale calls coinciding with rambo separate from earnings reports one of the first things i will be doing when i see a call flow or whale activity that i like is check it against the companies investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of hunting for rambo picks i’ll test this on in light of jnj vaccine this weekend wait on price action to settle for tech calls epdhttpsiimgurcomu18rgpbjpg 🚀 🚀 dipping a toe in with this nice boring boomer midstream oil giant they pay a fat ass dividend yield of 83 but lets be reali couldnt care less about that because this dd is about the hunt for glory not my retirement income the real opportunity is in the fact that on friday two separate bets were placed for epd in the near future including a 23c for 326 they coincided with upcoming rambo as epd is holding an investor day on march 4th with an esg discussion preceding it on march 3rdhttpswwwenterpriseproductscominvestorspresentations they are also holding a q and a session to field questions from both events you know who else scheduled a q and a to discuss their investor day spot did last week i see this as a confidence move and i see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould potentially be newsworthy ill roll the dice here but keep it safe and drop if the news is a dud as a side note though oil is just a good long term play for 2021 my xom and rds leaps have been puhrinting as always pick a good entry point biduhttpsiimgurcomg5xabodjpg 🚀 🚀 edit the bidu stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a prehk listing split with a neutral effect affect whatever on nasdaq share prices whales and call flow likely related to

lu46g7,frog,-27.53%,🐸🐸 jfrog $frog dd a great software company with a lot of room for growth 🐸🐸,dd,11,0.57,stoney-the-tiger,42,🐸 is getting ready to leap this is my first dd post so i would appreciate any feedback and criticism of assumptions i am making here but i thing that jfrog is setup for a good run in the next few months and here is why what do they do their main product is jfrog artifactory which is a universal repository for software binaries runnable code and it also serves as a mirror repository local copies of open source software they also offer jfrog xray that scans those open source libraries for malwarevulnerabilities this is one of the most critical cogs in the software sausage factory artifactory is comparable to a walk in refrigerator with the mirror repo it adds the loading dock with xray it also helps to ensure food safety you may have heard of the solarwinds attack and if you have been following it heard that it is described as a “supply chain vulnerability” attack in my professional opinion the toolset jfrog offers is the best available to combat this kind of threat and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security that is why i am very much a bullfrog 🐂🐸 if there is interest i will do a deeper dive into this aspect at another time but for this initial one this is the huge surge in demand for their capabilities and the need for going beyond the basics is my thesis why this company is positioned to do very very well going forward company background they were founded in 2008 and there main product has been artifactory ever since it has only 1 direct competitor with similar scope sonatype nexus but artifactory is better and cheaper sonatype started as a plugin for artifactory that does something similar to xray before xray existed then they copycatted the universal repo so jfrog hit back with xray i have used both of these products over the years since 2013 and i have worked in environments without artifactory improves developer productivity a lot and it secures company intellectual property their product is used by most of the fortune 500 companies this includes google aws microsoft ibm and facebook these companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels the software that runs their entire companies safe that should tell you something about how good it is they have over 90 renewal rate of their customers they acquired shippable in 2019 which basically lets them offer the whole sausage factory though the area where this competes is very competitive with some very good products that are open source their focus lately has been on offering a saas model to complement their on prem offering and make adoption easier this should also grow their revenue a lot because it will make it easier to buy the total package instead of just the most basic they went public in late 2020 but it was very low key since they came out the same day as snowflake financials i am including a couple of comps here based on the segment they operate in atlassian team makes jira confluence and trello which are used by most software teams for managing requirements and agile software team collaboration i picked them as a comp because i view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing artifactory crowdstrike crwd is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running as a high growth software company unsurprisingly their gaap earnings are negative surprisingly to me though they are very minor and they have even had 1 quarter of profitability frog $01861 crwd $04763 team $49355 their market cap frog $49 b crwd $478 b team $594 b their forward pe ratio frog 615 crwd 771 team 173 they don’t have any long term debt their current ratio short term assetsshort term debt is 53 their margin is over 80 revenue is growing 44 yoy ownership 65 owned by insiders and institutions most of that ownership is insiders because there are only 5 etfs including an ark index fund that own it their final lockup was just released on 216 after their earnings and insiders have through 313 to sell before they go back into lockup this is similar to what happened with palantir recently but it seems like most of them have sold what they are going to sell tldr they have a great product and have cornered a growing market they invented which has high barriers to entry they are well managed and have good financials as well positions 420 shares and 61 options i am planning to get 8 more options on monday if you havent guessed yet i like the stock you can check my post history to see some yolo posts from earlier this week i will post another update when i am fully loaded

lwj15j,none,n/a,rant about bond yields,discussion,41,0.91,throwawayyyyy37,74,what people don’t understand is that stuff reopening is exactly why bond yields are going up our velocity of money will spike up and we’ll get the inflation from the 22 of our monetary supply we printed in 2020 and bonds have to compete with inflation so yields will go up making the algos we use favor value instead of growth now a simple way to put it is if bonds are 25 that’s like a 40 pe ratio and the samppthe stock market is at 39 then you have to have compression in the markets i know most people don’t understand how inflation can lead to lower stock prices in the medium term but it’s all over the news now if you watch so i’m not making things up it erodes the future purchasing power and eroding the growth potential until the inflation hits the real economy boosting their bottom line but until then bond yields will rally on our reopening and stocks will have to have multiple compression of the pe’s or price to sales ratios if they have no earnings the reason we have had this bull run was low yields and rates due to how bonds and stocks constantly compete for investor dollars so if rates are low they have nowhere to go other than equities i know that a lot of you have been born in this bull run as in haven’t seen a market that doesnt only go up this multiple compression will happen if we get the new stim bill and open up like texas thus overstimulating the economy and causing inflation that bonds will react to faster than the inflation hits companies bottom lines it also effects the multiples of growth names due to yield competition,2021-03-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lwj15j/rant_about_bond_yields/

its inception on jan 29th 2020 ditched dreams of nasdaq listinghttpswwwnewcannabisventurescomhightimesditchesdreamsofnasdaqlisting gthightimes holding corp parent of high times revealed that it has abandoned its efforts to list on the nasdaq a goal it had been pursuing for since mid2017 the company launched an offering two years ago at $11 per share through the reg a process and it reported that it would extend its reg a capital raise until 4545 million shares had been sold or until march 31st it disclosed in an sec filing that it recently sold 363636 shares at $550 in a private placement to ontariobased rayray investments raymond leach an original investor in medreleaf a 50 discount to where it has been selling shares high times securities lawyers stephen weiss and megan penick of la

refunds teri buhl of cannabis law reports talks reg ahttpsvimeocom438846483 harvest acquisitions it was in march that harvest health announced an $80 million buyout of that entire company then literally two months later we see a letter of intent filed by hightimes now and harvest saying gtokay well were actually going to buy the california assets of have a heart why that was contradictory is that harvest had just been on an investor call telling people when an analyst asked gtwhy are you doing this deal they said well we want a stronger footprint in california it didnt make sense that two months later theyre getting rid of everything they just bought in california additionally in the last month there have beenmultiple news reportshttpsmjbizdailycomhightimescannabisretailbidcomplicatedbywebofownerssocialequitypartnersamp questioning if harvest even has ownership or control of the cannabis licenses to sell to high times very little cash actually changes hands in the deals crafted by high times instead it has announced millions of stock which isn’t publicly traded yet will pay for the asset purchases with the harvest acquisition high times attorney stephen weiss confirmed for clr that $15 million was paid to harvest but at signing only $500k was given the asset purchase agreement filed with the sec said high times would pay harvest $1 million on signing this is just a complete lack of transparency and its completely unfair for the main street investor trying to get into cannabis done before starting the securities and exchange commission has told a us operated cannabis media and dispensary company high times holdings that they must halt accepting investments in their miniipo because they have failed to meet an extended deadline to file their audited annual report gtthe last date the company was allowed to take investments was the middle of june high times used a reporting extension the sec created because of the covid19 pandemic to get a 45 day extension to file the annual report and said in recent sec disclosure filings called form 1u that they promised investors to get them current revenue cash flows debt levels and asset values by june 12 2020 via the annual report but clr has learnt that this never happened adam levin’s company has spent over two years trying to get main

fact that they couldn’t actually accept sales when asked if it is normal practice for a reg a issuer to continue to solicit investments when it can’t accept sales securities attorney sara hanks said ”the sec may have softened up in the covid crisis but previously both sales and offers were supposed to stop during such time as the issuer was delinquent in its filings because there is no exemption under reg a for “offers” advertising etc while a company is delinquent” high times still has their investment offering page

on my credit card from an airport in la the same day they charged my card for the ipo they stated that it would be refunded never was i can still log on and see the shares i have “invested” but they obviosuly don’t represent anything lesson learned recent financials the company filed apostqualification amendment to its form 1ahttpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardata1714420000121390018007523f1apos2018a1hightimesholdhtm with the sec that suggests the financial condition has become even more precarious in the first quarter of 2018 sales plunged 649 to just $1481 million most of the decline can be attributed to the events business which fell almost 83 but publishing revenue declined over 16 as well the company indicated that its cannabis cup events will take place later in the year compared to the prior year with one in las vegas and in los angeles taking place in the first quarter of 2017 and none in the first quarter of 2018 the $554k in sales were generated by smaller events and the company expects the number of cannabis cups and small events to increase for the full year it blamed the publishing decline on lower sales at the newsstands and through subscription and lower print advertising revenue with digital partially offsetting these factors the company provided information about its cost of revenue which was $503k as well as its operating expenses which declined substantially to $2391 million producing an operating loss of $1413 million compared to an operating loss in the first quarter of 2017 of $654 million much of the yearago operating expenses were due to a onetime noncash charge of $6689 million for equity compensation charges for consulting the last time the company filed official annual earnings was june 2019 high times had told investors it would get updated financial information on june 12 but that did not happen the company has extended the offering of shares for two years initially telling investors that it would list its shares on the nasdaq then it lowered those expectations to the overthecounter marketplace still it hasn’t happened i am not a financial advisor so

lwvezn,asx,7.97%,i think igo limited asxigo has an undervalued position as a lithium mining play for the inevitable ev revolution high level dd,dd,24,0.72,veniceking719,42,felt compelled to start a discussion given i can’t find any mainstream analysis regarding what i think has to be one of the stronger lithium plays to make everyone knows the big dogs in the lithium space albemarle alb sqm ganfeng etc and even the smaller speculative players however it seems there is one mining company that’s flown under the radar and quietly secured itself a piece of what i think will be one of the most important lithium mines in the world let me tell you about igo limited asxigo and the deal they made to cut into greenbushes greenbushes mine located in western australia is operated by talison lithium a joint venture by tianqi controlling share and albemarle tianqi bought some shares in sqm at the height of the last lithium boom but since then prices have fallen flat and tianqi is fucked with debt they needed a lifeline and in december 2020 igo was happy to help and secure a piece of the lithium powered future for about 13 billion they secured part of a very valuable asset let me explain below greenbushes mine utilizes the hard rock method of lithium mining and depending on who you ask is the largest such mine on earth raw spodumene is mined that is then processed to lithium carbonate from there it can be refined into lithium hydroxide the most sought after lithiumbased component for ev batteries that is one method of mining lithium the other way is via brining brining is the way they do it in the lithium triangle of south america which is where most of the mainstream attention on lithium mining is placed however i think that when the supply crunch comes brine mining will be be disfavored by ev and battery manufacturers let me explain below hard rock vs brine hard rock has a lower production cost but a lower output yield it is relatively immune from the effects of inclement weather it does not require massive amounts of water and it’s environmental costs are relatively pedestrian compared to brining brine mining has a higher production cost but a higher output however it is affected by inclement weather likely to become a problem over the next 10 years imo requires massive amounts of water and has some pretty steep environmental and political risks source httpswwwwiredcoukarticlelithiumbatteriesenvironmentimpact given the large amount of water required in the brining process and the political effect it has on local and indigenous peoples i don’t think it is viable in the green future ev and battery makers will feel pressure and may even face regulation that their supply chain is carbon neutral green etc when you consider why the ev revolution is happening it doesn’t make sense to buy lithium from a source that requires massive amounts of fresh water a resource that is sure to come under more scrutiny in the next 15 years there is a possibility that innovation could fix the environmental concerns with brining but personally i don’t know if that is likely to happen before the supply crunch that is expected by 2025 now the key $$$ fact is that when a hard rock mine’s lithium carbonate is processed into lithium hydroxide it is the highest margin product in the lithium trade can’t post the graphic but it’s in this source along with other great info sourcehttpspagesmarketintelligencespglobalcomlithiumbrinevshardrockdemoconfirmationmjadhtml brining can also yield lithium hydroxide but it requires an extra step and extra cost in the process to do so so now we know that a hard rock mine that produces lithium hydroxide provides the highest margin product available greenbushes mine has the benefit of a lithium hydroxide refinery vertically integrated into its production cycle the plant is called kwianna and was solely owned by tianqi until igo came in for 13 billion igo secured 2499 stake in greenbushes mine and 49 of kwianna lithium hydroxide plant what’s interesting is that ablemarle tried to buyout tianqi of its greenbushes share in the summer of 2020 from my pov this is indicative of how valuable greenbushes is thankfully the igotianqi deal was structured in a way that per abl spokesman didn’t trigger the right of first refusal clause speculation is that china was loathe to let an asset fall in complete control of a rival giant which makes me think that if tianqis financial troubles continue igo could be in a prime spot to secure an additional stake in greenbushes and kwianna tldr brine mining has credible downsides that i believe are being overlooked which could make hard rock miners more desirable by evbattery manufacturers as more attention is placed on their supply chains and the supply crunch comes to fruition greenbushes is the largest hard rock mine in the world and i believe one of the few that has a lithium hydroxide plant vertically integrated igo is in a unique position having bought into a mine with operations already up and running 25 of the mine and 50 of the refinery it is almost completely absent from all lithium mining discussion by mainstream outlets and i don’t understand why that is relatively new to investing and posting so if there is a reason that igo isn’t a worthwhile play please enlighten me position holding long 550 shares $541 usd and buying more when i can can’t post the otc ticker as i don’t want this post to get removed pm me if you want it not financial advice i like the

located further north ampx200b ipo and leadership in 2011 kkr bought out aso however aso recently went public on october 2 2020 led by ceo ken hicks aso is wellpositioned to continue boosting its

financialshttpsdocsgooglecomspreadsheetsd14d1tgdkxrbz1f3yddq6uclt04mxzxjivpqmdeuirwedituspsharing obtained from yahoo finance click title for link to spreadsheet this is a key part of my valuation of aso it displays how criminally undervalued aso is a company relative to the market as a whole as well as its competitors i have linked a google spreadsheet to this post that shows several key indicators as to why aso is undervalued relative to its competitors i will compare aso’s financials to dick’s sporting goods as they are the most similar competitor aso’s trailing pe ratio is currently 1082 as compared to dks’ 1756 aso’s forward pe is 978 as compared to dks’ 149 aso’s ps ttm is 041 as compared to dks’ 074 aso’s pb mrq is 229 as compared to dks’ 315 additionally its most recent actual earnings 091 eps were 24x its predicted earnings 039 eps and its predicted earnings for next quarter are 048 eps still well below last quarters earnings aso 2396 078 313 academy sports and outdoors inc yahoo financehttpsfinanceyahoocomquoteasopaso ampx200b debt aso’s debt is one of their few worrisome financial indicators they have a great deal of debt with their debt to equity ratio sitting at 27259 as compared to dks’ 15066 however aso has already designated around $200 million obtained from their ipo to help pay off some debt is this retail ipo a winner the motley foolhttpswwwfoolcominvesting20201017isthisretailipoawinner they also have the ability to pay off shortterm debt so i do not see this as a company that will likely go bankrupt their current ratio mrq is 161 and although this is significantly lower than many other gunrelated companies it is actually lower than dks’ 14 which shows that they do in fact have the ability to show off their shortterm debt ampx200b short interest while i am not a fan of solely using short interest as an indicator to invest in a stock it can still be a helpful tool according to s3 researchhttpswwwshortsightcomcategorys3research aso’s short interest as a percentage of its float is 2818 as compared to dks’ 1497 both of these are fairly high and show that there is great short interest against both these companies although i strongly believe that there will not be a sudden short squeeze over time i believe that sustained stock price growth will force investors to cover their short positions and will definitely help fuel aso’s stock price growth technical analysis aso has been following a strict channel since its ipo in october as seen below it has bounced off support and resistance multiple times but still remains in this channel aso is currently hitting the bottom of the channel and i believe it will soon bounce back this is a perfect stock for mms to manipulate and keep in this channel with small volume and sizeable bidask spread httpspreviewredditlf1ye790duk61pngwidth1396ampformatpngampautowebpamps408a12894490a9040f3a6a095b6cc96caa354cf2 ampx200b

and so i believe it will break through that price as uuncowisdo pointed out in the comments amazons ath was $70 at one point 3 someone also asked why i have 319 and 416 calls if my target price of $30 is dated 51 this is because i bought them before i knew the earnings report date and i still dont believe they have officially announced it as 48 yet also their costs were relatively low compared to

reading beyond the first 9 words of the title and the fact that this is sitting at 60 upvoted id encourage you to at least read to the tldr i usually stick to providing raw data but this post has a little bit of added analysis i don’t own $gme or $rkt i dont actively invest to avoid accusations of bias in my data and don’t like either stock over the other i do like wsb though and don’t like baseless conspiracy theories and i have seen a lot of conspiracy theories flying around wsb recently without much evidence to accompany them most recently i got flooded by comments like this on my

theories and see if i can provide a base for it the theory in question is “$rkt discussion is being artificially pushed to distract from $gme” a tldr of my analysis is a both $rkt and $gme are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on wsb b accounts discussing $gme are actually newer to wsb on average than accounts discussing $rkt c there are a small but nonzero number of people trying to artificially manipulate discussion to get others to sell $gme however this is done with no relation to $rkt d accounts mentioning $gme and $rkt behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks through my analysis i wasn’t able to find any solid evidence of $rkt being artificially pushed as a distraction from $gme while it’s easy to complain about uzjzs ironfisted bot army i think it deserves a lot of credit for curbing attempts at manipulation now i will provide the data backing up these conclusions and call out one account i did find attempting to artificially manipulate discussion ampx200b both $rkt and $gme are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on wsb accounts discussing $gme are actually newer to wsb on average than accounts discussing $rkt i don’t think i need to patronize you with a bunch of facts and figures showing how much attention has been drawn to wsb recently obviously this attention came with a lot of new posters and that’s fully on display when we look at when accounts talking about $gme and $rkt first joined the wsb community the motive behind looking at these numbers was to determine whether there were a bunch of new accounts who joined the community with the sole purpose of distracting from $gme the average $rkt poster first posted on wsb on december 10th 2020 this is pretty shockingly young but the average $gme poster is even newer to the community with an average date of december 22nd 2020 here are histograms showing when the accounts mentioning both stocks first joined the community by

deserves some sort of moderator action on the $gme graph we have uchar1101g way out in the upper right he just started posting on here yesterday and has been just absolutely spamming antigme shit since although posts like sell you gme stock seem to match the grammar and speech patterns expected of a shortonly investor i dont really see this single example as solid evidence of a larger artificial antigme push on the $rkt side of things we have two accounts that are pretty clearly tied to real people so i don’t want to call them out by username while i’d say they’re pretty clearly innocent of being hedge fund accounts old accounts lots of personal info lots of nonwsb posts they’re absolutely guilty of living in the discussion threads with dozens of comments already today you could probably make an argument that someone commenting about $rkt all day long is having some impact on the overall discussion but given that it’s just two random dudes i kind of doubt it has much of an effect in the grand scheme of things accounts mentioning $gme and $rkt behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks the last thing i wanted to look at was how accounts behaved in promoting $gme and $rkt in particular i wanted to see if accounts mentioning either stock were more likely to mention it repeatedly i ended up not finding much of a significant difference below is a table where

squeeze but primed for a gamma squeeze that will look insane and just might resuscitate the engulfed bricksandmortar retail industry there are a lot of heavily shorted names out there and while i expect most of them to reap massive tendies $skt is the one that stands out lets start with the elephant in the room shortinterest and float $skt is currently the most shorted stock out there with 3176 of total shares short as of this morning this beats any of the names we know gme amc bb rkt etc interestingly enough $skts short float is at 4725compared to every other meme stock other than gme with 60 $skt is easily one of the most if not the most shorted names in the market right now httpsfinanchillcommostheavilyshortedstockstodayhttpsfinanchillcommostheavilyshortedstockstoday not to mention the shares float provides incredible insights into $skts future tendies similarly to gme skt only has about 90m shares outstanding while gme has roughly 69m lol bbby has about 121m shares outstanding which explains why it got somewhat closer to gme than others but these other names rkt 198b shares amc 339m shares nok 57b shares bb 563m shares all have simply too many shares outstanding thats not to say its impossible to squeeze em but it would require far less capital to squeeze gme bbby or say $skt the trend in shortinterest also seems to be going down with $skt and the broader market in general the wsj wrote something last week about hedge funds starting to close shorts or at least being more cautious and after being the 4th largest put decrease overall in q4 skt short interest is off another 19 since february over the past 6 months we have also seen everincreasing volume on $skt a previous dd mentioned average trading volume on $skt from the decfeb period was roughly 3m shares this has increased to roughly $5m shares in the last few months today $skt appeared to breach the seal with over 175m topping the 10m high we saw in jan coincided w gme this is incredibly important bc heavy volume when a stock moves up puts massive pressure on long shorts essentially if i am right chapter 1 began today we should keep an eye on the volume this week more volume is a great sign all of the technical trends bode well for $skt but whats got me stiffer than a rock are the broader macro forces guiding both the market and the economy first $skt reinstated their dividend for 2021 q1 indicating they have ample cash not only to weather this storm but to continue raising payouts to shareholders which is quite attractive since 🌈🐻 are getting concerned about rising rates no problem skt has stable fixed payments and will award investors for holding these will also increase as the economy improves attracting more investors ✅ next we heard from biden earlier in the week that they expect vaccine distribution to be ramped up by may not july this is a huge win for battereddown bricksandmortar retailers who have caved bc of public health restrictions as investors race to pick up these forgotten family spots the value or really just oversold names will start to fly ✅ not to mention tanger mall outlets whole premise is their malls are outdoors perfect for a postcovid world that is more mindful of social distancingsanitation ✅ where do i think this could go this is where market capvaluation comes into play for all you dipshits who look at the share price and ask why it dont go up market cap is the true determinant $skt currently has a $17b market cap far less than competitors mac $21b spg $40b or other highly shorted names like rkt $56b or amc $29b so is a $200 price target a little fluffy and optimistic sure but tldr when you factor in how shorted $skt has been heavily shorted by melvin capital among others most shorted stock right now

shift towards valuedividendpaying stocks i have to say i like the stock quite a lot so help me god $skt is going to fucking skrtskrt to the moon update a lot of people have been saying melvin capital owns skt this is false melvin owns skt convertible debt likely bc they are grubbing for yield who can blame them on something as fruitful as skt this actually is a good sign to me as boomers who find skt dividends attractive will push up the stock another catalyst for a gamma squeeze never ever fall victim to false information please do your own homework link to melvin puts on skt

lx6cbg,none,n/a,should you buy the dip some research results and dippinator,discussion,47,0.89,invnsbl123,30,dont know if this is okay to post it here but would like to get some opinions probably everyone has heard about a saying “buy the dip” i know many believe it is a risky strategy but there are plenty of research suggesting that over sustained time it might be profitable and sound strategy for example this one httpswwwspglobalcommarketintelligenceendocumentsmiresearchqrbuyingthedip180522pdfhttpswwwspglobalcommarketintelligenceendocumentsmiresearchqrbuyingthedip180522pdf below are the results of back testing 2002 2016 data httpspreviewredditul5eb2a73wk61pngwidth690ampformatpngampautowebpampse77a04df316cdb82863263a98623c7b97f135521 if you read the paper you will find that these returns can be improved by using additional screening criteria and company fundamentals conclusion from there “a sharp decline in stock price can signal an investment opportunity if investors can accurately identify which dip to buy and when to buy it it is important to note that no one indicator can ever constitute a solid investment decision on its own and btd is no exception to this rule in this paper we examine several factors that may be used to improve the profitability of the btd strategy our empirical analysis shows that institutional ownership level stock price trend and company valuation can all contribute to the overall success of the btd strategy” now all of this is cool and dandy but how to identify those stocks there are plenty of market screeners that can show you biggest losers of the day but how to know at what point dip the bottom well que in support points some say that using support points is same as predicting future from stars or cards but somehow dips always find their bottom and more often than not it’s somewhere around previous low points i could not find any freely available tool that could show me tickers that dropped to their support points admittedly i haven’t looked for very long so decided to build my own – the dippinator i wanted something that gives me a lot of info in a single screen and where i could check the latest news or public opinion about the ticker to get the sentiment behind it took me a few weeks and now i have result – a tool that drops me an email notification when ticker meets certain conditions and falls below 3rd support point to calculate these points i’m using the following formulas 1 pivot point pp high low close 3 2 first resistance r1 2 x pp – low 3 first support s1 2 x pp – high 4 second resistance r2 pp high – low 5 second support s2 pp – high – low 6 third resistance r3 high 2pp – low 7 third support s3 low – 2high – pp conditions 1 ticker dropped below third support point and possible gain if it reaches 1st resistance point gt25 2 liquidity avg volume today’s volume must be more than 1kk 3 market cap gt50kk have been running it for 5 market days it has identified 326 events meeting the criteria above investing same amount $100 in all of them would have yielded below results these does not take into account a possibility that position could be sold before close at higher point httpspreviewredditmpc6b4s93wk61pngwidth226ampformatpngampautowebpamps2468ea3e530bce4f7ee625b5cab6334bcd378522 obviously i don’t have enough resources to buy each event but i have made some day trades and ended up with 14 gain my biggest gains were from pltr and fgen combination of notification from tool and some manual screening should always give better results as some companies deserve to fall into oblivion furthermore last 5 market days had a lot of volatility so it might not be very representative of future performance i’m sharing all of this because i think there is a possibility to use dippinator as a pointer where to look problem is that i might be missing something and would like to hear your ideas suggestions or critique on red days it bombards with notifications for example on 23rd of feb i got 142 notifications it kind of also helps to see early on the trend for the day currently i’m scanning total of 5k tickers from us markets and data is refreshed every 4 minutes once ticker below 3rd support point is identified i get below notification example is end of the day 2nd of march i will break it down bit by bit

opinion and these numbers have not been audited round 2 ding ding ding heres my previous analysishttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentslspbb5gmeddanalysisofoptionsexpiryon226and tldr the data indicates that squeezes could be on the way analysis currently roughly $227m in value or 116m shares callput are in the money at each $10 threshold up to $150share approximately 1m shares come into the money at each increment at $160share approximately 2m shares come into the money ampnbsp since rate of delta change is the highest around each strike price meaning gamma is also largest it would lead me to believe that a ton of shares will need to be bought to hedge these positions as these share price amounts are passed creating a sequence of gamma squeezes ampnbsp if price were to squeeze up to $810share 56b market cap the net calls in the money would exceed the float this is insane even if calls were covered on the way up by buying the underlying its not possible to cover more than 100 of float 8m shares would come into the money creating a huge gamma squeeze this in turn would create a massive short squeeze even if current short reporting is accurate which is somewhat questionable at this point there are more net calls alone that need to be covered to exceed float which means shorts would be squeezed not just because of the price but also because of share lenders calling shares ps not sure how this works so would like to hear others weighin if they understand this better really hitting this price seems like it would create a squeeze of epic proportions ampnbsp

lx7835,none,n/a,looking at price charts is bad and stupid,discussion,23,0.69,anikom15,22,tldr buy more $gme retards okay hear me out this is assuming you are investing in companies and not simply trading stocks for quick profits obviously shortterm traders use price charts in all kinds of fancy ways to make their money it seems like astrology to me but apparently enough people are making a living off of day trading so i wont comment further on that investing in companies isnt necessarily longterm it just usually ends up being longterm because companies tend to make more money over time not less so selling early is generally dumb with these boundary conditions established we can get to my point whatever price an asset was in the past says nothing about what the price of it should be today therefore price charts are useless for determining the true value of a stock consider an ideal whore at room temperature it costs $5 to sleep with her yesterday it would have cost $10 to sleep with her the reason for this price difference is unknown to the market in general and can only be speculated upon does the fact that the price is different have any bearing on your decision to sleep with her it shouldnt here are some conditions you might use to make an informed choice on your financial decision do you have $5 to spend is there something more valuable to you for whatever reason that you can pay the same $5 for does she have any stds does she have any semblance of a personality etc now you might think well it used to be $10 i only have $5 now and it might go up in the future that type of thinking is dumb you literally have no idea why the price difference was there you can speculate but its only that speculation this type of thinking is inherently irrational and by allowing it into your decision process you are adding noise to your signal taking away mental processing on considering the types of questions such as the ones listed above so how does this relate back to stocks we can value stocks the same way everyone has his own valuation strategy i look at earnings the companys capacity to grow the markets capacity to grow whether the companys guidance is conservative or aggressive etc when i do this the price chart doesnt fucking help me at all the reason is because this chart doesnt actually give me any useful information beyond what a historical price was this is because price correlates with too many things and we cant break that down to specific indicators that we can actually play upon in essence price charts are more noise than signal when you decide to buy or sell a stock you should be basing it on the current price and your valuation model if you allow yourself to start rationalizing decisions based on price movements youre playing yourself by allowing emotional irrational thinking to become involved astrology again if youre day trading thats totally different and theoretically day traders use other tools like volume to make their decisions not just price charts so what does this have to do with retards on wsb it means stop looking at fucking price charts and selling your shit too early or buying shit just because the stock is cheap right now know what the fuck youre doing or just blindly follow one of the smart retards like dfv either of those things are going to be better than taking a profit or buying the dip on stocks you know nothing about dont allow yourself to get into emotional voodoo by looking for signs through price charts instead look at indicators that have better defined causation earnings dividends debt news etc supplemental information price charting is analogous to the following in my retarded opinion astrology biblical numerology divination flat earth beliefs young earth creationism feng shui crystal healing myers–briggs type indicator scientific racism social darwinism parapsychology anything from mra movements general theory of relativity etc,2021-03-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx7835/looking_at_price_charts_is_bad_and_stupid/

lxal1c,rkt,2.88%,my theory on what happened today in $rkt and how we can avoid this going forward,discussion,119,0.69,5pencer_,270,as a preface i encourage anyone with hard data that might refute my claims to please do so i am merely sharing a theory that i see as logical and might help us in our fight against the hedge funds ampx200b alright guys as everyone has noticed $rkt was victim to a severe pampd over the last 48 hours i have spent all day thinking about why this may have been the case after all it looked absolutely primed for a juicy shortsqueeze and a big w for the apes in the midst of a stagnant war over $amc and $gme this was a planned event backed by the hfs who seem to be gravely short on $gme and $amc i am here to share my theory and how we can learn from today to further pressure hfs positions into squeezing our true guns $amc and $gme i will first share a couple points that i think will adequately set up my theory 1 while hfs were caught with their pants down in january they understand our tendencies and capabilities this time around the hfs are turning our own irratic mob mentality approach against us while we see this as a strength we must understand that our nature can very easily be used against us especially by those with vastly larger amounts of consolidated capital to work with our community is fastmoving and ready to yolo a stock at any time however the hfs can move faster because of their vast resouces their daytrading advantages and their better understanding of our nature this time around they are positioning themselves in spots to act in predatory methods and profit off of us ampx200b 2 hfs have realized their one major advantage over us day trading while we always get to see the real bagholders of the community dropping incredible 6figure amounts of money into stocks and calls we must be real with ourselves and acknowledge that most of us apes do not have at least $25k in our portfolios why is that number important day trading i caught rkt on marketopen 32 and saw my combined call and stock holdings soar from $400 to $1300 by close i wanted to sell and reallocate those gains to amc and gme before close but could not because i did not have a daytrade available for me to use these hfs someone correct me if im wrong can daytrade all they want because of the value of their accounts as for us not the case they can act and react to the market at any time without penalty this provides them with a major advantage over us currently in terms of tickers that are not amc or gme ampx200b the theory i believe that the hfs are trying to scrape for any method possible to avoid the moass from happening entirely we all see the si and can realize that it is probably to high for the hfs to maintain paying those highfees much longer but what if there was a way for them to raise enough capital to not only offset those fees but continue to short amc and gme to drive the price down and outlast our will i think their answer was $rkt $rkt had that special dividend news that was very exciting to all us apes and stirred up quite the commotion around this subreddit the hfs saw their chance they purchased calls to help push the stock all the way up to what we saw it peak at yesterday then sold those calls to pocket their gains hfs then turned around and slapped those gains into puts just before close hence the dip we saw just before close during ah and pm this ties into my previous point i made about daytrades while many of us would not have had the capability of doing that hfs had the capital to do so upon open this morning the hfs further dumped into short positions on rkt causing price dips panic selling and a downward snowball effect the result a doubledip for the hfs they multiplied their investment on the way up on 32 by simulating a potential squeeze then further multiplied their investment by creating chain panicselling today how does this tie into the main event $amc and $gme i see many apes proclaiming that these types of squeezes that have suddenly been popping up all over are distractions that have been orchestrated by hfs i think that is true but it is much more serious than that not only do these fauxsqueezes serve as distractions to our main cause but they also serve as serious revenue streams for the hfs to survive the capital that they gained from todays $rkt pampd was likely used to not only pay off si fees but to also further short the stocks and drive them down not only does it allow them to drive prices down but it also helps them hurt our group morale as it pertains to amc and gme so how how do we fix this newfound problem we need to be very diligent about the scenario i just outlined rkt looked as primed as ever for an epic squeeze but was rekt within an hour today before you look to all these new squeeze opprotunities remember what happened today with rkt and apply critical thinking as to why this may have happened i have outlined my theory im sure others might have their own theories just please be careful and remember why we are invested in amc and gme we like the stock if we continue to buy into these phonysqueezes hfs can pampd their way to enough capital to potentially kill our positions in the stocks we love i am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice edit thank you for all your opinions i understand that this may be

this news is so god damn juicy and the institutional investors knows it but i believe they are currently trying to downplay this to drop the share price of this stock so that they can buy in large amounts at a much cheaper price now why is this news so big 1 sports betting revenue totals for each state across all top betting platforms a indiana – approx $209m draftkings accounts for $83m fanduel accounts for $51m b new jersey – approx $874m couldn’t find amount per platform but i would estimate approx $200m for draftkings going by their annual report figures new jersey is the largest state 2nd being nevada at 834m where sports betting occurs if we compare draftkings to fubotv – currently draftkings has about 1 million active monthly users on their platform whereas fubotv currently has approximately 540k with an estimated growth to over 700k by end of 2021 if even just half of those users were to bet on the platform we’re looking at approximately $100m in additional revenue generated for the company and i think this is being conservative also these are just the initial states that fubotv has secured market access with we should expect more to come soon 2 the company reported a major loss to earnings in their annual report due to approx $200m in assetgoodwill impairment why is this important currently the company is reporting approximately $400m of net losses for 2020 with half of those losses coming from assetgoodwill impairment this impairment occurs due to an overvaluation of assets by the company and they are essentially correcting this asset value we should not expect these large asset impairments yoy because impairment only occurred due to the company overvaluation of intangible assets after the merger with facebank with that said i’m surprised at how low the analyst’s earning projections for the company was even though everyone knew about the asset impairment losses prior to the earnings call i think this low analyst projection hurt this company more because it caused a huge net loss surprise to investors 3 customer base doubled ad revenue doubled and revenue doubled from 20192020 the fact that this is being overlooked by so many investors is crazy to me based on these current projections fubotv should see approx $500m of total revenue generation by end of 2021 by the time they start generating sports betting revenue we’re looking at potentially a $1b revenue generating company by the end of 2022 when we factor in that asset impairments will be much lower by the end of this year i am expecting that the company will start seeing huge net gains by end of 2022 4 according to the grand view research source below the gambling market size was valued at $537b in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 115 from 20202027 meaning by 2027 the gambling market is expected to be nearly double that of 2019 this is a huge and rapidly growing market with plenty of revenue to share across multiple different platforms just because other betting companies may hold a larger share of the market doesn’t mean fubotv will not greatly benefit from participating in this market ampx200b ampx200b these are just the few catalysts that i found from doing a little bit of research there is plenty more but i’m too lazy to write it out and i believe just these few factors alone makes fubotv an extremely valuable stock with exponential growth in the near future sources “billion dollar baby nj sports betting hits another new record”

lxf7y0,none,n/a,whats happening with the bond market or how i learned to be a 🏳‍🌈🐻,dd,462,0.91,shitilostagain,408,preface gme apes hold on to gme with your diamond hands this is not a ploy to get you to sell nor is this post for you this entertainment not financial advice this is just a 🏳‍🌈🐻 look into the bond market and why you are seeing red and will continue to tldr first so anyone interested in taking a trip into the bearcave and coming out the closet on the other side can understand whats happening tldr the fed is no longer in control of interest rates stocks are artificially inflated due to the fed injecting money into the economy with nowhere for it to go but to investments with stocks offering the highest returns of all possible investments this used to not be an issue as the fed was in control of how much qe could be done through open market operations as they were the buyers but as the money supply is now enormous coupled with rising money velocity the fed will now have no choice but to start the process of qt but to do that they need to sell bonds which they are struggling to do due to low interest rates to sell more bonds to reduce the money supply they will have to increase interest rates resulting in a sea of red and the🏳‍🌈🐻s taking a trip to tendietown part 1 macro 101 review if you are comfortable with macroeconomic concepts feel free to skip this part this section is just definitions for the retards on the short bus that flunked out of econ for this dd we will need to understand the concepts of money supply money velocity open market operations qe and qt money supply is the total amount of money in the economy money velocity tells us how fast money is changing hands through the economy more info at httpsenwikipediaorgwikimoneysupplyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikimoneysupply and httpsenwikipediaorgwikivelocityofmoneyhttpsenwikipediaorgwikivelocityofmoney open market operations refers to the fed purchasing or selling securities on the open market which is one of three monetary tools the fed has at its disposal with the other two being the discount rate and reserve requirement which are not important for this dd qe and qt refer to quantitative easingtightening which is where the fed performs open market operations to either increase or decrease the supply of money in the economy part 2 whats been happening so far now that we have let the retards off the short bus lets discuss where we are right now at a macroeconomic scale and how we got here i want to get to what is happening with the bonds and i will try to keep this as short as possible as we all know the fed has been printing money like crazy since last year with jpow money machine go brrrr as a result the money supply has gone through the roof since the pandemic hit which we can see below in the m2 graph ampx200b m2 money supplyhttpspreviewredditr3kdt4v2pyk61pngwidth1168ampformatpngampautowebpamps251465226f305cd7687d088ee853546ef116f3eb unless you have been living under a rock this past year the reason the government has been printing money like crazy is due to the money velocity falling like a rock due to the coronavirus pandemic if money velocity is down people and businesses arent spending and if people and businesses arent spending the economy contracts hence the need to inject money into the economy just to keep it afloat ampx200b velocity of m2 supplyhttpspreviewreddityqs9c8c6pyk61pngwidth1168ampformatpngampautowebpampsc4b140b90c74d9d2e229e6e72b2cb17631566537 the primary way that the fed has been dumping money into the economy is through quantitative easing meaning that the fed will buy bonds and other securities during open market operations aka operation bears r fuk this effectively allows the government to exchange existing securities on the market for cash freeing up money in the economy while the average citizen has been getting bent over a barrel with a vacuum attached to their wallet the stock market has gone fucking insane over the past year why because for the most part corporations institutions and boomers hold the instruments such as treasury bonds that are repurchased by the fed during open market operations which those groups and people then insert right into the stock market because there is nowhere else to park their money corporate bonds have been either risky or have low interest rates us government bond interest rates are garbage businesses have been risky investments due to the rona and only the stonks market has gone up if we look at just before the pandemic to today the value of all the stocks in the sampp500 have increased around 5 trillion dollars the graph that shows this can be seen here httpsychartscomindicatorssp500marketcaphttpsychartscomindicatorssp500marketcap keep in mind that the gdp shrunk around 23 last year and unemployment is still relatively high meaning that this growth is absolutely not organic at all part 3 what looks to be happening ok that was long now onto the bondslets think about whats been happening so far over the past few bear weeks bond yields go up market takes a massive shit calls on $rope increase in value the bearcavetm becomes the hot new club right now yields have nowhere to go but up and the fed has no choice but to increase them thereby tanking the market which we will see next as the money velocity increases as the economy opens back up the amount of total money flowing around will increase as the same dollar will move faster through the economy artificially inflating it if we keep the money supply the same as it is now while increasing the money velocity we will have a serious problem on our hands this is because the value of the economy as a whole has not increased so more money will represent the same pool of goods causing an extreme amount of inflation the money printer was good when the economy was shut down and saved our asses from a great depression part 2 electric boogaloo but will cause inflation unless the money supply is reduced as money velocity increases the fed knows this and are currently in the process of issuing new debt in the form of bonds httpswwwmarketwatchcomstoryrecord414billionofnewtreasurydebtissuanceposessupplytestforshellshockedbondbuyers11614708102httpswwwmarketwatchcomstoryrecord414billionofnewtreasurydebtissuanceposessupplytestforshellshockedbondbuyers11614708102 this is quantitative tightening in action with the fed now performing open market operations to reduce the money supply to prevent all that money from flooding and tanking the economy but there is a problem that the fed is currently facing which is that nobody wants bonds that have shit interest rates to get people to buy their bonds they have no choice but to raise interest rates time is also ticking as the economy is reopening and the money velocity is increasing as can be seen in the fred money velocity graph meaning that if the fed doesnt raise rates inflation will become a problem very quickly and they will have to sharply increase rates or the entire us economy will be extremely fucked as a side note the ratio of increase is higher in m1 than m2 which could potentially exaggerate damage to consumers unfortunately for the stock market but fortunately for the 🏳‍🌈🐻s who have not been hunted to extinction as bond yields increase money will flow from the stock market to other securities as well as back into the general economy reducing the total funds in the stock market causing it to crash part 4 my dance moves phew that was long unfortunately as of the writing of this post it looks like higher interest rates could be around the corner at any time and the higher they get the harder the market will drop as money flows from stocks to bonds and other less risky securities to take advantage of this i plan to exit some long positions and swap them for cash as well as shares and calls on inverse market positions such as uvxy sqqq and spxs again this is not financial advice and if you buy stocks that people mention on the internet without properly researching them first you are actually retarded ampx200b edit not financial advice hi everybody it looks like my post gained some traction last night as a thank you to those who have read and commented i will address some of the questions and points people are having in this edit so they are visible to all one of the more common questionspoints is that the fed just wont allow rates to raise because they dont want it to again like it says in the dd at this time i do not believe the fed is in control of the interest rates and will quickly have no choice in the matter no matter what daddy jpow says they will do it may not happen today or this week but it is coming as money velocity goes up with the same amount of money in the system due to economic reopening inflation takes off like a bat out of hell if inflation goes up the us dollar becomes less valuable and if it goes up too much the us govt will have exciting new problems to deal with to reduce the money supply through qt the only real tool that the government has is open market operations to sell securities on the open market to reduce money supply meaning that they need to sell bonds which will require higher interest rates because they just arent selling with the shit rates they are at now the rates must increase to prevent widespread economic pain another question is that why hold cash if there is inflation wont i lose money that may be true that your money will become less valuable if inflation takes hold but you will have much less of it if you hodl during a crash or try to time the market ok now that some questions have been answered bonus round first lets talk about why the market crashes when funds flow out the best way to think about the total market price at a macroeconomic level is through supply and demand if we say that the supply is the total number of stonks in the market and demand is the amount of money in the market we can see that generally the total money flowing in or out of the market is what determines market value as the supply of stocks for sale is not changing a lot on a day to day basis across an index or a market another thing to realize is that the fed is between a rock and a hard place if you think about it no matter what they do there will be pain and someone will end up getting kneecapped holding bags loaning out money to get people to buy bonds looks bad as it looks like a government scheme to con people into buy worthless bonds capping bond rates will kneecap and effectively nationalize the bond market potentially sending shocks through the system do nothing and inflation fucks everything raise rates and the market gets flushed down the toilet rates are also so low they cant be decreased further finally no matter what happens in the market uvxy sqqq and spxs are currently at rock bottom prices there is little room for them to shrink but an enormous amount of room for them to grow once again thanks everybody and this is not financial advice ampx200b jpow interview and bond activity update as of 3421 400 pm interview sauce httpswwwwsjcomvideowatchjeromepowellatwsjjobssummit10ff0df9c0e4421589965e5ba991bbcehtmlhttpswwwwsjcomvideowatchjeromepowellatwsjjobssummit10ff0df9c0e4421589965e5ba991bbcehtml us 10 year bond yield rates httpswwwcnbccomquotesus10yhttpswwwcnbccomquotesus10y ampx200b ok this will be the last update on this dd before i let it ride and see what happens after watching the jpow jobs summit interview there are three things to take away with the first two relevant and the third being very important first is that at 355 powell mentions that as spending surges due to reopening the fed will be expecting excess inflation this is largely in line with and provides some evidence for my claim that as the money velocity increases we will have inflation due to the money supply not contracting enough to prevent inflation the second is that for now until the fed sees its goals met ie max employment and price stability or until inflation becomes a problem the fed will continue its policy of qe timestamps 955 amp 1855 this will continue to inject money into the economy so no big surprise there but do keep in mind that this money printing will need to be continually managed through selling treasury securities back on the open market so if there continues to be trouble in the bond market that may potentially have an effect on the current qe being undertaken the first two things are not surprising but the third big takeaway is quite important which is that the fed is prepared to combat excessive inflation by raising rates at 1350 powell was asked about the market sentiment that the fed will raise rates earlier than expected his response was that the fed will not raise rates unless the labor market is at full employment or if inflation becomes excessive as of now inflation is around 15 and the fed has a target of 2 powell mentioned many times that they are okay with inflation being a bit over that as long as it is transitory but at 2430 powell also said that the fed will not let inflation get out of control and was very adamant about that the third takeaway is important as when coupled with the the fact that the rising money velocity will increase inflation as well as the fact that the us govt is struggling to unload bonds it seems to suggest that the fed will soon indeed have no choice but to raise rates to prevent excessive inflation due to the large money supply coupled with increasing money velocity the sentiment in the bond market seems to agree with the 10 year treasury yield up by 8 basis points today to 1564 this is also good evidence for my thesis that money from the stock market will rotate out into bonds and other investments as yields have no choice but to improve and again today has been another bloodbath in the stock market if this continues i would fully expect to see more money rotate out of stocks further crashing the stock market see yall at my new favorite club the bearcavetm again not financial

that hedgies are putting in these gigantic orders on gme saying its gonna go down during lunch hours when there is least activity thus driving the price of gme down even tho its supposed to be gaining retarded 40 gains everyday due to si these orders all stayed in the first 10 even 20 minutes of market openi thought they probably won’t change since i just started to actually use bren but then i look and its way different some of y’all are gonna hate but ive been watching rkt alongside since this week funny thing is when rkt went up 40 in one day gme started dropping correlation edit2 the short interest on borrowing shares of rkt was 55 the other day march 3rd rkt went up 40 or so to a high of like $41 on march 3rd today it went back down to mid 20s and the borrow rate is still 44 citdadel has short positions in both they cant win on both sides so they had to sell rkt positions increasing the price massively since there was a high demand because “ dividend news” finally hit main stream and a bunch of subs started pumping it making citadel insane profits on the way up and on the way down mind you the dividend news was from jan 29 i believe so it was all coordinated to make online retards bag holders and so apes bought it and some sold for loss others sold for good gains but others are just holding because they too now like the stock it has 44 borrow rate and only 300k shares available as of 2pm est march 4th so they make money on rkt going up and down continue short laddering gme to keep the price suppressed it all worked in their favor but rkt doesnt seem to be dropping below $25or heck it wont even go below $20 because ill buy more lol some diamond hands got in and started fucking shit up like me hehe 58 shares wassup baby mind you beginning of march and even at its ipo rkt was only at $20 during their ipo they only put out 13 of their float because there wasn’t a high demand the news “oddly didnt cover or care about their debut” which is the same gay bears were dealing with meaning in the future more shares are to be put out but until then cant the price of its shares quadruple if shorts are forced to cover especially with such low amount of

lxq24n,uwmc,2.75%,united wholesale mortgage $uwmc bull thesis from a real estate professional,dd,1080,0.78,madetoordername,465,ive been building a position in united wholesale mortgage $uwmc for months now since their merger was announced and with these prices i decided to offer some dd to any members of this sub with the ability to hold more than one stonk in their portfolio tldr uwmc is better than rkt and i think its better for both the shortterm traders and the longhold investors i have read a lot of great analysis of their financials all over reddit recently so i wont bore with too many details but the high altitude view goes as follows went public with a $16b valuation based on only three quarters of 2020 95x multiple on adjusted income in q3 2020 alone they did $145b in net income which means their q4 reporting towards the end of april is going to be massive at todays price the dividend yield is over 4 annually exdividend date is this coming tuesday meaning if youre going to buy do it before tuesday march 9th it was announced this week theyll be included in the russell 1000 and russell 3000 index beginning march 22nd which means extra buying necessity between now and earnings for the semiretarded members here this means tons of net buying between now and march 22nd because of index inclusion dividend bonus and earnings runup ampx200b now as a realtor id like to add some professional analysis here and ill touch on rkt briefly too because theyre being compared a lot due to sector similarity but their models are totally different ampx200b 1 it doesnt matter what mortgage rates are mortgage originators always make x margin on every loan they sell what matters is the number of purchases and refis ie how many widgets they sell nationwide there is a massive shortage of housing supply because people are simply not moving which means when things return to normal well see 1x 2x 5x and in some markets even 10x the number of homes being sold which translates to the same number of new loans being originated profits are way higher on new purchases vs refis so while nobody is turning refis down their marketing dollars are spent generating loans on new purchases anybody who tuned in to uwmcs final sales call of 2020 for their national reps heard their ceo matt ishba talking about how theyd spend the money theyd get from going public and he was all about relationships relationships with realtors particularly but also with other real estate spheres in influence insurance agents title companies etc 2 rkt has great market share but realtors hate when clients consider using them because they frequently take way longer to close a loan than what is considered normal 34 weeks right now originators like the salespeople working through uwmc have a major competitive advantage against rocket and others because they close deals fast that is all that matters to realtors and realtors are often the person that is pointing people in the direction of the lending option rkt may get a lot of market share for refis the lower profitability loans but uwmc is poised to get a growing share of higher profit new purchase volume especially as supply of homes for sale new and preowned increases to meet demand now anybody who has either considered selling a home recently or buying a home recently knows this but for those not in those categories the real estate market is insane right now think melvin capital scrounging for gme shares to cover their shorts in the biggest gamma squeeze cycle ever insane mediocre homes are selling for over asking price within days of hitting the market and buyers are fomoing hardcore into paying these escalating prices thats a great thing for sellers but doesnt do anything good or bad for uwmc holders ampx200b this is what matters for uwmc investors as inventory increases which it will because in some states covid made it near impossible to sell in 2021 and as prices become to normalize causing more people to want to move because it wont be insanely expensive on the buy side the volume of high profit loans for new purchases will increase again it doesnt matter if interest rates go up a little its not like theyre going to double interest rates are at all time lows as seen here from freddie machttpwwwfreddiemaccompmmspmms30html and that isnt going to change for years to come uwmc pays a regular dividend is about to announce an insane q4 on or around april 23rd and since theyre the largest originator of loans in the country they will absolutely see a rising price moving forward into 2021 shortterm traders best bet for you is to buy slightly otm april or may calls personally id buy may calls but with the intention of selling them during the earnings runup if that happens andor holding them through er if the runup isnt significant enough due to the markets overall vibe right now buying may calls gives you extra insurance which i like but degens should stick to april and save the premim long term investors at current prices between $910share today if youre not buying now than there is no helping you ive bought at levels as low as $9 and as high as $12 and im comfortable anywhere in that range i dont think a price of $1618 by years end is unreasonable once the company has steady quarterly growth figures for bigger investors to buy in with i believe well see over $20share only if the market as a whole starts humming along and only if local home sale inventory returns to 2019 levels and id guesstimate that is 5050 shot tldr again tons of net buying between now and march 22nd because of index inclusion dividend bonus and earnings runup in april ampx200b proof of my 10000 share position httpsimgurcomb65agw9httpsimgurcomb65agw9 ampx200b my buy orders today are set 1000 shares $871 filled 1000 shares $861 filled 1000 shares $851 1000 shares $841 1000 shares $831 ampx200b again this is just the bull thesis i think a few decent bearish points have been made elsewhere that i can get behind but most have to deal with mortgages being unsexy or the company being young and untested well 1 making money is sexy to me i dont know about you fruits 2 most of the members here are young and untested too probably spreading stis all over your local areas via grinder before covid good luck to all happy trading and lets expand our horizons a little like the old

construed as such i am a broke law student with a vested interest in the success of gme i also have an innate ability to decipher logic and rational behavior so i’ve decided to share my opinion with you all for your own preponderance feel free to discuss as i embrace the importance of evaluating a set of facts from various perspectives if you have not done so already please read or skim the op below and pay homage to both udanbrenhttpsnewredditcomudanbren and utapakiphttpsnewredditcomutapakip for their service in bringing this information to my attention once you’ve done so return here if you’ve read their posts already proceed to the gates of valhalla below $100mm of deep itm gme calls have been purchased since 31monday gme

utapakiphttpsnewredditcomutapakip points out in the comment below there is a very strong presumption that these calls were all purchased by the same buyer they are the only one purchasing calls that are this deep itm within the last three days and are all purchased out of the philadelphia exchange its actually mindboggling to me that anyone would be willing to shell out this much premium and take on the exponential amounts of risk all in all it makes the most logical sense that these have all been bought by the same individual when considering the facts we have

for this whale to exercise all of their calls next let’s find out what this leviathan actually spent to acquire these options yes asshole now i am calculating the purchase price sorry for your

even ask this time i know you can’t count that high it’s a grand total of $104582725 op’s estimate of $100mm was very close to be blunt that’s a lot of cocaine and hookers this is where things get interesting ampx200b now as op also pointed out the buyer has the right to purchase 942500 shares by april 16 note the options above with an expire on jan 20 2023 and jan 21 2022 respectively nevertheless they are all itm so the buyer can exercise them whenever they feel enlightened let’s do some more math apes love math this behemoth has already shelled out $104mm for these options and has the right not obligation to shell out an additional $12298500 for the actual shares $104582725 $12298500 $116881225 purchase price exercise price we also know the total of shares to be potentially exercised is 942500 using this information we’ve me mostly done enough work to extrapolate a rough breakeven price for this colossus of clout buyer $116881225 942500 12401 this big whale’s total breakeven price lands at $12401share ampx200b shut the hell up i know you just mumbled to yourself that’s underwhelming as fuck just consider yourself a smooth brain thats why im here i will admit that on its face it might seem like i wasted all of our time now hit that joint or moscow mule and ponder what it actually means…… ampx200b ampx200b welcome back brother if you couldn’t think of anything again confirming how smooth your brain is let me help ampx200b a massive fucking buyer just exposed themselves to an exorbitant amount of risk they could lose tens of millions within minutes with that in mind i can guaranfuckintee that nobody on this planet would overleverage themselves in the amount of $116881225 without having a some extremely important information or b some serious fucking diamond kahonas my wager would be on the former but also the latter in any case anyone who drops $116m over the course of three days has some deeeeeepfuckiinngggpockets they have more money that’s a fucking fact compound that with this buyer’s breakeven at $12401 it logically follows we have found our new baseline price for gme let me explain consider all this information with what happened yesterday gme closed at $12418 just 17 cents above this buyer’s breakeven what ensued in ah a backandforth teetertotter throughout the entire ah session ultimately every time gme dropped below $124 it hit a springboard back above the closing price and finally finished at $12500 flat in sum i believe the new baseline price is $12401 relying on my aforementioned ability to deduce logical reasoning i am resolute in my opinion that this big bag dickslanger will be valiantly defending hisher breakeven price at $12401 do not get this confused with them giving a fuck about us or anyone else they might but its in their own best interest to hold that line whether it benefits us or not is probably the least of their concern furthermore think about it yourself if you dropped a combined $100m in three consecutive days you must have a contingency plan it is my belief that this multihundred millionaire potentially billionaire has much deeper pockets than what they leveraged on the options theyll almost assuredly be using millions more to ensure the success of their $100m options play i would be remissed if i didnt acknowledge theres a slight possibility this person is just a dumbass ape like us hitting a ballsdeep yolo play with his entire trustfund inheritance but i doubt it in the event my hypothesis checks out gme is currently sitting at its new support level this is bullish and provides a good buying opportunity tldr i believe the new baseline price for gme is $12401 this is the breakeven price of a huge fucking whale that spent $104m $116m if exercised on call options spanning the last three days march 1stmarch 3rd with that in mind gme closed yesterday at $12418 just 17 cents above this buyer’s breakeven to go further every time gme dropped below $124 in the ah session it hit a springboard back above the closing price and finally finished at $12500 flat it is my belief that this multihundred millionaire potentially billionaire has much deeper pockets than what they leveraged out on the options theyll assuredly be using millions more to ensure the success of their $100m options play which means keeping the price above their $12401 breakeven

lxwhpy,gme,79.31%,gme possibility of gamma squeeze just went through the roof,dd,18291,0.92,yodisc,2930,as promised in the discussion thread i would post some updated info on what friday could bring in terms of itm options tldr the number of possible contracts itm could be double last weeks expiry over 4 million shares could be called on for these exercised options only adding to the ever increasing snowball here is what i did pulled the option chain data into excel ran some numbers on open interest and found some crazy info what is a gamma squeeze for those who dont know what a gamma squeeze is but have heard it thrown around let me give a brief eli5 gamma squeezes revolve around options i wont go into too much detail here on what those are but basically you purchase a contract which gives you the option to buy the stock at a set price on a future date regardless of what that stocks current price is contracts are typically in lots of 100 shares per option contacts are not usually sold by individuals but rather market makers biggest of whom being option houses out of chicago they have a complex price model which values contracts at set prices for said contract based on probability of them becoming itm in the money of course the higher the stock price for the contract the lower the cost because the odds of that happening is low these market makers thought gme was garbage and sold way more contracts than they could feasibly handle because what are the odds gme $15 goes to $150 market makers selling these contracts need to buy shares to hedge which of course will cause that price to rise more and more now that gme is $130 today was a great day gme closed up $817 or 658 maybe not the crazy gains some hoped for but on a down market day is pretty incredible now a rise in only $8 may not seem like it has much of an impact on gamma squeeze potential but just wait gme options exp 20210305 this friday gme $100 last fridays close option expiry at this level going into friday we could expect 22427 in open interest in itm gme contracts this week that sure is a lot of possible stocks that need to be purchased if those contracts are exercised about 2242700 to be exact or about 497 of the total float crazy gme $130 we can expect 35989 contracts to be itm if tomorrow closes above $130 a solid 13562 more contracts than at the $100 level this equates to 3598900 shares or 797 of total float now were getting nutty what about gme $150 closing friday above this level brings thousands more contracts itm in fact closing above this price means there would be 46397 contracts itm this means that a whopping 4639700 shares or 1027 of total float more than double $100 what does this mean well not every contract will be exercised even itm these market makers have also likely been finding shares to hedge for some time now as well but its entirely impossible to ignore that if every contract were to be exercised 10 of all the shares in circulation would be needed and if anyone knows anything about supply and demand it means more contracts will come itm next week and then more again the week after and so on with the steady price rise weve been seeing it could be these market makers are slowly buying up shares to hedge could is operative and this is entirely speculation what we do know is that massive amounts of money have been changing hands over this past week in gme theres been crazy volume at times particularly today the day before contract expiry any how ill put away my tinfoil hat what we could be witnessing is the beginning of the beginning the first dominos does this information guarantee the stock takes off to the moon and beyond no not really but it sure does increase the odds of that happening we probably cannot even fathom how these market behemoths are willing to protect themselves we all saw what happened with rh and whats crazy is its possibly the tip of the iceberg for actions they took its just the action that we were able to see summary since last friday 20210226 last option expiry the number of contracts possibly itm has doubled i repeat doubled if tomorrow closes above $150 and every contract is exercised 10 of total float will be called on even if nothing happens tomorrow and we close $130 there is still 50 more contracts itm than last week all of this continues to build that snowball thats started to get mighty big ampx200b ill say it again for those in the back doubled mic drop not financial advice this is just for fun any questions feel free to ask away,2021-03-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxwhpy/gme_possibility_of_gamma_squeeze_just_went/

ly14x0,spxl,12.52%,beta slippage and long term spxl or any other 3x bull etf trade premise,discussion,21,0.84,afanboy12,6,definition beta slippage is defined as the multiday tracking inefficiency from investing in levered funds said another way due to how some leveraged funds rebalance you will lose money due to compounding that doesnt track the original underlying this slippage gets worse when the leverage is greater or returns on the underlying are more volatile as an example calculation suppose you have stock a and etf b that is 3x levered to a and daily rebalanced to ensure a daily 3x starting point ex 1 a goes up 10 day 1 and down 10 day 2 a 1 11 9 99 gt a lost 1 b 1 13 7 91 gt b lost 9 ex 2 a goes up 25 day 1 and down 20 day 2 a 1 125 8 1 gt a is flat b 1 175 4 7 gt b lost 30 your levered fund can lose money even if the underlying is flat day over day now lets get a bit more realistic and lets minimize our downsize dod to do this one way would be to have the underlying be spx which has circuit breakers that will close the market for the day at 20 ex 3 a goes up 1 day 1 and down 1 day 2 a 1 101 99 9999 gt a lost 01 or 1 bp b 1 103 97 9991 gt b lost 9 bps how often does this happen or something less bad about 70 of the time market moves are between 1 to 1 30 of the time the slippage would be worse granted it can work in your favor if the market only goes up ex 4 a goes up 10 day 1 and up 10 day 2 a 1 11 11 121 gt a is up 21 b 1 13 13 169 gt a is up 69 or 6 more than you might expect if you were just doing 3a as an estimate this clearly overestimates the benefits as the typical day is not 10 up the question becomes are we green more than we are red and does the distribution of returns on average render beta slippage to be near 0 well you actually have to run some trials i look at the worst point in history for this trade below a quick side note spxl has a high expense ratio 101 and is often shorted gt why because people attempt to long the other end and just pick up the beta slippage component from shorting spxl but its very expensive to short spxl the trade premise just but spxl and keep holding dont look at your account cause you can lose 96 of it in some cases if you are the worlds worst market timer what about downturns well lets consider literally your worst possible scenario so far you bought in for $1 on october 9th 2007 and you just held and you just kept holding well at some point march 9th 2009 you had 4c but if you continued to hold today youd have $230 now what about if you had just bought spx rather than the spxl version you indeed would have done better you would have $243 thats a 13 better return over all of those years because you did not buy spxl however this is the worst scenario in history thus far that was the largest peak to trough we have ever seen since the great depression but there were no circuit breakers then suppose you instead bought in some random day in 2006 call it the beginning of 06 youd have $39 for spxl vs $297 for spx a 93 return difference between the two on a $1 how does this trade fail pretty easily if the distribution of returns changes to be a tad more swingy overall beta slippage increases significantly and youll lose out and if average returns are negative this strategy is horrendous however im all about relative wealth concerns if the spx is doing well id like to be doing even better how about if the spx is on a longterm decline and it will literally never recover i probably have bigger things to worry about than my cash in my investment account so i dont mind being wrong note i did not take into consideration the expense ratio when calculating the above does it likely have a bigger impact than youd expect yes does it turn the investment negative vs spx in the longrun i dont think so edit i cant comment on this post lol my comment karma is too low automod removes it so one more point here an additional note while dollarcost averaging underperforms lumpsum investing for investing in spx widely researched but its pretty simple right on average the market goes up so youd want your money in as soon as possible this is not true for spxl dca outperforms over the long run because buying in a downturn for spxl turns out to be extremely profitable and mistiming your bets kills your overall return,2021-03-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ly14x0/beta_slippage_and_long_term_spxl_or_any_other_3x/

ly4lze,a,0.41%,a class gamma squeeze 101,dd,389,0.91,outthemud247,138,i want to share the very definition of a gamma squeeze people keep pushing a gamma squeeze but don’t actually know what a gamma squeeze is “in a gamma squeeze the price of a stock transiently increases based on an investor buying many options to drive up the prices of select stocks due to option sellers needing to hedge their trades on the underlying stocks “ the reason gamma squeezes are even a thing is because of this they don’t have to own shares to sell you shares therefore not really costing them much with options because they are more riskier and more volatile they have to make sure they have those shares available which causes them to hedge those options thus costing them more than it would if they just sold you shares where the gamma squeeze actually happens is when you have multiple weeks of high options volume coupled with options expiring in the money high volume call option purchasing drives the price up which in turn helps the upcoming expiring contracts to expire in the money causing them to be covered which causes the price to go up even more now one week of this most hedge funds can recover and regroup from but multiple weeks they cannot often times at this point if the stock isnt already heavily shorted any short positions begin doubling down often leading to the stock to be shorted this is why gamma squeezes can lead to short squeezes though not a guarantee i want you to understand the simple concept of what a gamma squeeze is so you aren’t just expecting something you haven’t fully understood yet more less just throwing money into a stock aimlessly you may not like what i’m saying but anyone who knows anything about a gamma squeeze knows i’m telling the truth i’m just simply wanting people to understand what a gamma squeeze actually is and that each day that passes that option volume does not increase the less likely a gamma squeeze can happen you can refuse to acknowledge the facts or you can simply understand the fundamentals of what a gamma squeeze is a gamma squeeze is not something that magically happens it’s happens with consecutive weeks a high volume of options investors with calls expiring in the money yes borrow interest ssr etc are all great things but those things alone don’t cause a gamma squeeze increased option volume forcing sellers to hedge the shares for those options is the very definition of a gamma squeeze borrow interest short available ssr etc aren’t some magic wand they just set up the ability for a gamma squeeze to happen on another notethere is also a quadruple witching date coming up on 319 if you don’t know what it is just type it in your google search engine and read which adds to the possibility for a gamma squeeze to happen the day alone doesn’t guarantee anything in addition to that friday was great and those ftd’s helped the possibility of a gamma squeeze but that alone won’t cause it i honestly would imagine hedge funds laughing at people trying to gamma squeeze them without actually buying a lot of options actually i know they would be laughing at people trying to gamma squeeze them without buying a lot of options because you can’t have a gamma squeeze without buying a lot of options it’s like trying to start a car with no gas high volume of options investors is the gas for a gamma squeeze without gas options investors that car gamma squeeze goes no where and if you only fill that car up once ftd’s from last friday 22621 it’ll start but it will only take you so far before it runs out of gas i wouldn’t share this if i didn’t want to see all of the people that have invested money into amc win i want to see you guys win it would be a sad day if i sat back while you hope for a gamma squeeze and not tell you what a gamma squeeze actually is great night apes this is not financial advice just a mere essay teaching gamma squeeze basics class 101 thanks to this community because every other community has silenced me it’s really led me to believe that some of these communities are ran by hedge funds themselves trying to manipulate people and lead them astray i had speculated that but the fact they delete my post explaining how to properly execute a gamma squeeze on certain reddit and discord communities seems real sketchy to me again thanks,2021-03-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ly4lze/a_class_gamma_squeeze_101/
ly4ykn,sndl,-17.04%,why im holding $sndl and plan to buy more,dd,92,0.68,yerbuhdfinn,113,none of this is financial advice nor am i telling anyone to buysell stock this is my opinion based on the most recent public information i could find your investment choices are yours alone and im not a professional by any stretch this is a casino now with that out of the way the reason sndl is currently down is a combination of hedgefund shorting daytrade usage but also simple market correction it looks like most cannabis stocks have undergone a market correction this week im not that worried im just gonna hope that their next financial statement is sexy and that the next one is even sexier despite its infancy as a company i believe sundial growers is drastically undervalued and can become highly competitive i personally plan to hold for awhile at the time of writing this sndl is at a dip and i dont think it will last long this company is far more than a pnd my plan is to go for a long hold and buy more when i have the chance this is why consider the following recently acquired nasdaq compliance if the value of their stock stays above $1 by june theyll maintain that compliance and likely be in good shape to keep up their upward trend on dec 21 2020 sundial announced that it has paid off all debts compared to other cannabis companies this is huge their new equity allowed them secure $600m in cash they should be stable for the foreseeable future sundial growers has undergone management changes presumably because of the number of serious setbacks in previous years mold fires air circulation issues everything you dont want to see in a cannabis company in january they have switched out torsten kuenzlen for zachary george while this could be a reason to be alarmed heres a quote from newswireca mr george brings a wealth of experience to sundial having spent more than 15 years evaluating catalystbased investment opportunities across the capital structure of north american companies with a focus on real assets  mr george has worked in a management capacity including as a chief executive officer with numerous corporate boards to turn around operations effect corporate action and implement governance policies in order to maximize shareholder value mr george cofounded the alternative investment platform frontfour capital group llc and currently serves as a trustee and director on the boards of cominar reit and trez capital junior mic  he previously served as the chairman of the boards of fam reit and huntingdon capital corp as the lead independent director of both cornell companies inc and pw eagle inc and on the boards of allied defense group inc and iat air cargo facilities income fund now consider the fact that despite having to solve these issues they managed to become debt free i believe the credit can be attributed to their new management and their financial restructuring earlier this month they had a market cap of 13b its currently 18b an incoming 5b market cap is not unrealistic and legalization efforts around the world will likely increase the market cap for multiple cannabis companies not just sndl american legalization does matter here just because they are canadian doesnt mean they wont export product to the us same goes for any other nonamerican cannabis company americans love weed and cannabis companies know it whether or not legalization happens this year its a political inevitability at this point sundial has also been making moves that suggest expansion efforts quote from nasdaqcom theres one company thats been of interest to sundial growers of late and thats microcap cannabis stock zenabis otc zbisf on dec 30 2020 sundial announced it had acquired a special purpose vehicle that at the time owned 589 million canadian dollars worth of zenabiss senior secured debt sundial will also collect a royalty under the agreement of between 2 and 35 depending on the companys net cannabis revenue zenabis made a payment on that debt of ca$7 million on dec 31 2020 but sundial still issued it a notice of default zenabis contests the default and in a statement issued on jan 6 says that sundial made such investment in an attempt to coerce zenabis into being acquired by sundial zenabis says that prior to sundials investment it was in discussions with its lender to get an extension on its ca$7 million debt repayment as of sept 30 2020 the company reported cash and cash equivalents of just ca$48 million and so liquidity is a clear concern for zenabis this quote is what is making me hopeful about their next earnings report on march 17 a lot of investing and stock websites ie motley fool are advising against sndl thankfully were retarded if my time on this subreddit has taught me anything its a sign that they want the price to stay low in my personal opinion their analysis is shallow and probably motivated by hedgefund worries when it comes to cannabis companies i dont rely on revenue info alone plenty of cannabis companies are struggling to be profitable sundial is preparing to release a new line of products with higher thc potency to meet the increasing customer demands they have made some drastic adaptations to their cultivation processes over the last six months and according to their new ceo the nature of sundial growing facilities enables the company to stay on their toes quote from zachary george ceo since inception weve compiled a broad spectrum of cultivation statistics including more than 600 harvests including 243 in 2020 and 52 in the third quarter alone sundial has leveraged his data analytics capabilities to focus on key improvement areas i am proud to say that just last month in october we generated the highest average potency results since sundials inception…” sundial has also gotten ahold of some promising cannabis genetics which they expect to have tangible financial impact in 2021 they have also been able to slash their costs and improve their efficiency ceo quote we exited q3 with lower costs greater efficiencies and dramatic improvements to our balance sheet despite underperforming on revenue we reached several key operating milestones as we continue to improve our processes we are also working to elevate our customer experience while driving longterm growth…” found on yahoo finance after reading through their financial statements can confirm and last but not least its weed i love weed and i like the stock i feel bullish on $sndl,2021-03-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ly4ykn/why_im_holding_sndl_and_plan_to_buy_more/
ly5d87,nvax,-28.44%,nvax update confusion and panic is driving the latest selloff nvax is a massive bargain at $155share time to load the boat 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,dd,44,0.75,upstairs_speech,66,tldr nvax is down over 35 in the last 3 trading sessions and 53 since the ath 17 days ago and now has a market cap of $118b this is an enormous overreaction for a company that has reported the highest efficacy to date against the original covid variant 956 and has several billions of dollars in advanced purchase agreements for 2021 if trading at close to 1x pricesales anticipated isn’t enough nvax is also the most well positioned vaccine maker to capitalize on the future booster market due to the ability to combine multiple strains in one shot and their excellent safety profile nvax is an incredible deal right now at $155share refer to my previous posts for more background and a more thorough explanation of nvax’s vaccine particularly my last post on 128 recap of how we got here on january 28th nvax reported best in class interim results from their phase 3 uk trial 956 efficacy against original covid variant which led to shares massively increasing over the following couple of weeks peaking at over $300share see summary figure from ra capital below outlining nvaxs vaccine performance against the competition since then several advanced purchased agreements have been confirmedfinalized and nvax has secured orders for 200m doses which ceo has indicated will be $20dose additionally nvax has confirmed agreements for 14b doses that will be supplied through exclusive license agreements with japan south korea and indiacovax nvax completed enrollment for usmexico phase 3 trial on february 22nd and will likely report interim results in march earnings on march 1st provided several important updates around manufacturing and development of a new bivalent covid vaccine however the market reacted negatively likely due to expectations around an update for the uk phase 3 trial completion and us eua shares continued to slide over the last 2 days due to broader market conditions closing at $155share today httpspreviewredditutbuipynd5l61pngwidth624ampformatpngampautowebpampse410d13bcb3bbc2a18b50edd2e616da2fbc423e2 nvax remains well positioned despite being behind pfe mrna and jnj based on several comments i’ve seen over the past few days it seems that many people are not aware that there is a massive market for covid vaccines outside of the us and that nvax already has an agreement with the us to provide 110m doses yes the us is vaccinating millions of people every week but we’ve known for months that nvax was going to be approved after pfemrnajnj and nothing has changed on that front for the first wave of vaccinations the us market was never going to be the major revenue generator for nvax it was always going to be about the exus market for 20212022 as of today nvax has advanced purchase agreements with the following countries that will likely pay top tier pricing which ceo suggested earlier this week will be $20dose canada 52m doses w option for additional 24m doses uk 60m doses australia 51m doses w option for additional 10m doses new zealand 11m doses switzerland 6m doses this does not include ongoing negotiations with the eu which have been reportedhttpswwwreuterscomarticleushealthcoronaviruseunovavaxeuclosetovaccinesupplydealwithnovavaxsourcesiduskbn2ab10h to involve supplying 100m doses with an option for another 100m there will almost certainly be several more countries that come forward with purchases in the coming weeks during the earnings call on monday ceo confirmed that all 8 manufacturing sites are making gmp product with us and sk performing final fill this is an important update and it appears that manufacturing will be able to deliver on projected supply of 160m dosesmonth once all sites are fully operational in mid2021 ampx200b new covid variants p1 amp b1429 can escape prior immunity to original covid variants and vaccination with 1stgeneration covid vaccines several lines of evidence make it clear that at least two of the covid variants in circulation are capable of immune escape this is a big deal because it means that existing vaccines will be less effective as we’ve already seen and will need to be updated in the future it also isn’t hard to imagine that in another 612 months after more of the population has been vaccinated that selection pressure will generate additional escape mutants that well need to think about ultimately this means that we’re very likely going to need updated covid vaccines with some level of frequency nvax and mrna are already working on bivalent formulations that will cover at least two variants and there’s very good reason to think there will be more updates in the next few years due to the nature of their vaccine platform nvax is best positioned to take advantage of updated booster shots in the future i went through this in more detail in my last post but to summarize nvax’s high potency allows them to use a very low dose of protein 5µg in their current formulation and they tested up to 25µg during phase 1 trials with no change in side effects as a result they have the “space” to add coverage against several additional variants and have confirmed that they’re already working on this pfemrna have much less “space” to add coverage against additional variants due to dose limiting toxicity as they’re already relatively close to the ceiling of how much mrna can be delivered in a dose without causing unacceptable levels of toxicity safety issues are already a concern with the existing formulation particularly for mrna which was the subject of a recent new england journal of medicine paper nejm paperhttpswwwnejmorgdoifull101056nejmc2102131queryfeaturedhome consequently mrna’s bivalent booster is being developed to cover two variants at half of the original dose to keep the total mrna at 100µg still safety remains a concern since we see an increase in side effects going from dose 1 to dose 2 due to an unknown mechanism and there are concerns that there will be a similar issue going from dose 2 to dose 3 jnj and azn’s platform use adenoviral vector platform to deliver the dna sequence encoding the antigen both suffer from the same problem which is that the immune system recognizes the vector and impairs the efficacy of subsequent vaccinations ampx200b nvax will be able to leverage their best in class platform against new variants and will be able to take advantage of an expedited pathway to get updated formulations approved in the future based on recent fda guidance linkhttpswwwfdagovmedia142749download as a result future trials will be able to take place much faster and the speed advantage for mrnabased platforms will be significantly negated compared to the first round of trials nvax is undervalued at $155share even before considering how massive the revenues for boosters could be nvax is insanely cheap at an $118b market cap i haven’t performed any financial modeling so i’m not going to give a price target beyond saying it’s much higher than $155 instead i’ll point you to the only four analysts who’ve provided updated price targets since earnings on march 1st eric joseph jp morgan $285share

$229b respectively cvac has no approved products and a covid vaccine that appears significantly less effective and is at an earlier phase of development bntx is the inventor of pfe’s vaccine and shares revenue with pfe yes both cvac and bntx are getting a premium for their pipelines but nvax has a pipeline as well with a flu vaccine that successfully completed phase 3 prior to the pandemic and an rsv vaccine in clinical development both of which are candidates to be made into combination vaccines with their covid vaccine ampx200b positions shares 319 $200 $220 $240 bought on the way

asked about the risks that inflation and overheating pose to the larger economy powell doubled down on previous statements and reiterated that the fed does not plan to adjust its policy until it sees significant evidence of maximum employment in the labor market among other conditions it’ll take some time to get there” he said noting that inflation is also running well below the fed’s 2 target section 1 hyperinflation is coming lets go back to some basics thanks to our current banking system we live in a debtbased society where our goal is to pull out a loan for 5 interest and make 42069 gains now everyone wants to be a chad with an infinite money glitch trying to compete for the same slices of pie so now we have a problem for example i have 100 tendies and you have 100 bananas and we decide a 11 tendie to banana rate is nice and life is good all of a sudden fucking chad mcdonkeykong says he has 200 bananas and he wants to trade with me so now we have 300 bananas in circulation and only 100 tendies i now agree that the exchange rate is 13 tendies to bananas and now youre down 66 on your banana trade fucking chad thats inflation for you more money is added into circulation and therefore you need more of it to buy the same goods now lets say your girlfriend gets pissed at chad mcdickface for putting too many bananas in the banana market why would she lol so he pulls out 100 bananas now with 200 bananas in circulation and 100 tendies the exchange rate is 12 tendies to bananas guess who just made tendies fuck ya you did now youre only down 50 from when chad entered the market thats deflation for you money is removed from circulation and there you need less of it to buy the same goods ya i know that already retard get to the point if we look at the uss monetary base blue and the feds balance sheet red you can clearly see theres a lot more bananas in circulation inflation ampx200b httpsfredstlouisfedorggraphfredgraphpnggbd97

experienced as well so it seems like a sweet spot for us humans to operate so what does it mean in order to stay ahead of all the new chads pulling out loans and yoloing you need to increase your net

so what the fuck were on 4 rounds of qe and no hyper inflation i thought the fed was an infinite money glitch so how does this qe infinite money pinata work first of all qe is a sum zero exchange its primary objective is to drive interest rates on treasury securities to 0 and thereby decrease interest rates the bank can loan at home loans credit card loans etc so how does it work its something like this primary dealer bank goes to the bond market looking for some tendies normally they would only buy $10 worth of tendies but papa jpow is mother fucking huuuungray so they buy $60 worth of tendies each time they go shopping this is fine if the bond market had infinitely supply but it doesnt the us will only be issue so much debt so each time the supply gets shrunk a little bit so over time well start to see a supply shortage remember bonds are retarded so when the price goes up interest rates and yields go down fucking magic jpow is trying to forcing a mother fucking supply shortage in bond market so whats jpow doing with these gay bonds see daddy jpow is worried that these little bitch ass banks jpm wfc etc are going to go full retard again like in 2008 so hes shoving all these bonds in safes and locking that shit up until were back to normal in exchange for the $50 tendies hes giving these ass hats $50 cash so they can keep jerking each other off as long as they dont yolo it into the markets and economy life is good daddy jpow also knows he can keep doing this qe trick until bond prices go to infinity but negative interest rates are kind of a pain to deal with now at the same time these smaller banks arent as retarded as we think they are and they also dont want to fail like in 2008 and theyve learned a thing or two sure papa jpow can throw money at them again but he already locked up some of their fun money and he was pretty pissed last time so the easiest thing to do right now is buy these dumb ass bond for cheap and sell them to daddy jpow for some easy gains they also know many of us are fucked without jobs so why even risk lending right now so banks are buying bonds jpow has a safe and banks arent lending nothing new here well the take away here is that all that money jpow is printing is stuck in the banks and the banks dont want to lend it out a good way to show this is the m2 velocity which shows how many times money changes hands before money is destroyed its like this monkey a borrows banana from chad mcshittyass monkey a buys tendies off monkey b monkey b gives banana back to chad in this case the banana went from c gt a gt b gt c since chad created the banana and destroyed the banana he doesnt count in the transaction so its just a amp b that matter in this case the m2 velocity would be 20 now lets look at how qe

it off banks are still not lending with all that jerk off money they got from papa jpow any time the blue line is above the black one it means banks are tightening lending restrictions as you can see

m2h3yu,none,n/a,this is why the squeeze hasnt even started to begin and that was nowhere near the peak,dd,7,0.89,gum6789,31,i am smooth brained but here is my logic for why the hedges havent covered the squeeze hasnt begun and i am more bullish than ever 1 even by conservative estimations of how fucked they are $325 peak wouldnt be anywhere close to them being able to cover all their shorts 2 if the price rise was from them covering who the fuck was erecting sell walls seems very counterintuitive to cuck your own plan if that were the case 3 the ceo of interactive brokers let slip live on air that gme was running into the thousands before buying was halted in january since then the hedge funds have dug themselves into a much much deeper hole 4 figures is now a very conservative amount per share 4 this is speculation but youd imagine there would be dialogue between the dtcc and shitadel if they had it under control either they had a convincing means to stop the squeeze or eat the peak then i doubt the dtcc would have been concerned enough to try push through the new rules shitadel and co could eat up a $325 peak and not go bankrupt 5 the fuckery and data shows they are petrified of us passing $350$400 i think we could be nearing a price where they could be margin called be north of those numbers 6 why are they still weaponising the media to convince us gme is dead they are desperate for us to know it is over if they had it under control they would just short it down without much fuss to the price they can close their positions at 7 the hfs arent stupid and wouldnt have shorted it so much to get us on the ssr there are definitely big players on our side who know what they are doing 8 i think we were ahead of a lot of peoples price estimates and we still have so many catalysts to come quad witching stimmies cohen becoming ceo all of these will spike interest and the price yes the bear trap seemed to come out of nowhere after such a steady rise but diamond hands are formed under pressure and it was never going to be a smooth journey i believe the german market will boost us back up to $280s for a fresh run at $300 today there is plenty of other more technical dd out there and some of mine may be speculative but thought might be worth sharing,2021-03-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2h3yu/this_is_why_the_squeeze_hasnt_even_started_to/

m3i8kc,none,n/a,how to keep your newly minted title of millionaire,discussion,8,0.9,goaliescottie,1027,so you did it you did your due diligence you did the math you summoned your courage to press that buy button and now those stocks and options have granted you a title you only dreamed of having millionaire congratulations you beat the odds that so many before you have failed to overcome you played the game and came out on top now its time to buy that house you always dreamed of or that car you always wanted to drive right sure if you want to lose your title of millionaire however if you d like to stay a millionaire there are some things you may like to consider this is not financial advice but rather 3 pieces of life suggestions a survival guide so to speak of the next 6 months and how to protect your new title ampx200b first protect it from everyone else dont tell anybody if there is one thing you take away from this let it be this so let me repeat that dont tell anyone this is going to be your most well kept secret in your life you will probably feel the urge to tell your friends and your family but doing this will ruin your life why well everyone is gonna want a cut theyre gonna say they need that new device or they need that new car or they need this or that theyll bring up how far you go back suddenly youll see the very people who have been your friends turn on you like vultures they may think they have your best interests in mind and they may not the harm theyre causing but theyll smell money and theyre gonna come asking in that case youve gotta be the bad guy youve gotta be the one to say no and friendships are going to quickly fall apart as you deny them or youre gonna bleed your money helping everyone while they take advantage of you and indulge their overspending habits to put it differently this isnt a question of who do you tell because word spreads rather this is a question of social survival do you want to maintain your relationship with your friends and family yes then keep it to yourself money talks but wealth whispers ampx200b second protect it from expenses if you want this money to last more than 5 years youre gonna want to treat it as if it wasnt there wait what then why do i have this money if im not gonna use it you will use it just not as a sum of cash if you have $18 million you are not going to go out and buy a $1 million dollar house and a $200000 lamborghini youll only have $600000 left instead you might want to turn to fire or financial independence retire early there you are going to use your newfound money as a source of income an easy equation for this is 4 thats it thats the equation 4 of your net worth can be used yearly while your money still sits in investments and accrues roughly 7 interest annually this way you beat inflation and you cover your expenses so to use our $18 million under the 4 rule thats $72000 you can spend annually and in theory you will never run out of funds while never working another day in your life or if you enjoy what youre doing you can add that to the equation as well how you break it up is up to you but you can very easily spend north of $100000 a year and still be in the green if you hold down a job meanwhile lets check in on our $600000 thats $24000 a year you can spend for the rest of your life if you wanted to retire today thats uncomfortably close to poverty you dont deserve that ampx200b third protect it from yourself yes yourself as quickly as you made your money you can easily lose it in the best 2 weeks of your life so right now emotions are probably high youre beyond excited you are itching to do something crazy with your money and probably want to buy something since you cant tell anyone per part 1dont buy anything right now yes you read that right dont buy anything if you need any proof on that look up what happens to lottery winners roughly 35 of which go bankrupt rather set the money aside for a while you can determine this amount of time but a good rule of thumb is 6 months in those 6 months it gives you plenty of time to calm yourself collect your thoughts and figure out an actual plan on how to wisely use that money how you want to invest it how much you want to use per year and how much you owe in taxes yes the dreaded tword taxes youve gotta pay up and during that planning process youll have to come to terms with what this money is going to do for your life ampx200b so there you have it a starter guide on how to survive your first days as a new millionaire written by someone who has never been a millionaire but i have seen some people make some awful mistakes about money and did my due diligence on what happens after someone gains a massive windfall and i have a feeling that more than a handful of you might be seeing a windfall come your way in the near future ampx200b to close they say money cant buy you happiness but im often reminded of the scene from captain america httpsireddit6zrwsfsstlm61gif money is only going to amplify how you want to live your life if you want to live generously leaving anonymous gifts and donations giving all you have away you can do that if you want to live egregiously expensive and live it up over spending at every turn you can also do that but you will need to face the consequences of either decision and if you in your nature default to one of these paths but dont want to it will take all the more effort to avoid it than if you didnt have this money at all ampx200b oh who am i kidding this is wallstreetbets you will all be fine just be careful my friends as this is a fight that may last the rest of your life,2021-03-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3i8kc/how_to_keep_your_newly_minted_title_of_millionaire/

m4a87a,none,n/a,i teach high school which means i explain things to idiots every day if you still dont understand call options i got you,discussion,47,0.89,the_superbus,3162,i see a lot of people asking basic questions about calls on just about every thread that mentions them so here you go note before the finance majors come out and nitpick small things remember that this is a basic primer for idiots some of it has been simplified what is a call option basics a call option hereafter referred to simply as a call is a contract that gives you the ability though not the obligation to buy 100 shares of a stock for a specific price by a specific date called the expiration date example you buy a $400 call for gme that expires on march 19th what that means is that at any time between now and endofday on 319 you can buy 100 shares of gme for $400 if the price spikes to $700 dollars you can still buy them for $400 thats a pretty good deal so i need the price of gme to get to $400 to break even and anything above that is profit right not quite you have to pay a premium for the option which is the amount of money youre giving to the option seller in exchange for the contract the premium is listed as the price per share so if the option has a $2 premium that means that you have to pay $2 per share of gme in the contract which means that you pay $200 the buy the call $2share x 100 shares you give the seller $200 and they give you the call option since you paid $200 for the option this means that your break even price is $402 dollars per share why because if the price only got to $400 you could have bought it for $400share without buying the contract which means the money you spend on the contract was a waste however if the price goes to $403share then you make a profit because you effectively paid $402share for a stock worth $403share but what if the price doesnt go up or even goes down do i have to still buy those shares for $400 no you never have to buy the shares if you dont want to remember a call gives you the ability to buy shares for $400 but not the obligation but what if the price of gme goes way up but i dont have $40000 around to buy 100 shares at $400share then you sell the contract to someone who either does have $40000 sitting around or slightly advanced info here that you dont need to know to someone who is trying to offset a position regardless of who buys it they will pay you a lot of money for your option because it is itm or in the money what does that mean lets look at some option vocabulary call option vocabulary strike price this is the price that you are allowed to pay for the stock per the contract in our $400 call option above the strike price is $400 at any time before the expiration date you are allowed to exercise the contract the contract and pay $400share for the stock exercise exercising an option means you are exercising your ability to buy the 100 shares of stock in the example above you would spend $40000 for 100 shares of stock regardless of the stocks price at the time can i exercise and only buy 20 shares of stock no if you cant afford to exercise then you can sell your option to someone else expiration date this is when your call expires if you have a 319 expiration date that means that your call option is no longer good after 319 premium the premium is the price you pay to the callseller for the contract and it is listed as the price per share knowing that how much will it cost to buy an option with a premium of 25 if you do the math it will cost you $25 which is 25share x 100 shares itm and otm in the money and out of the money itm calls are calls for which the stock price has exceeded the strike price if you have a $400 call and the price of gme goes to $405 then your call is itm because you can buy a $405 stock for $400 if you then immediately sold the stock for $405 youd make money otm calls are calls for which the stock price is below the strike price if you have a $400 call and the price of gme is $350 then your call is otm it is important to realize that being itm doesnt mean being profitable in the example above of the $400 call with a $2 premium if gme goes to $401 you are itm because 401gt400 but you havent broken even yet because your breakeven price is $402 fds fd is not an investment term and you dont need to know what it means in order to understand calls it is a wsb term and it stands for maggots delight but with an f because autmod wont let me define fds fds are otm calls with short expirations and as such are a huge gamble the guy who spent 90k on 1dte 1 day to expiration otm gme callshttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsm3r3v2foundouthowtobuycalloptionsyesterday those were all fds and they all expired worthless why are they called fds because when you buy fds you usually end up taking it in the ass when people list their option positions they use a bunch of numbers and letters that i dont understand how do i figure out what theyre talking about you have probably seen something like this gme $400c 319 lets break it down gme $400c 319 the gme stands for gamestop which you probably figured out the $400c is a call option with a strike price of $400 if it said $400p it would be a put option but well talk about those later the 319 stands for the expiration date now lets make it more complicated if i said i bought 10 $5 gme $800c 319 what do i mean it means that i bought ten contracts of gme $800 calls with a 319 expiration and i paid $5 per share if i paid $5 per share how much did i spend on my contracts i spent $5000 $5share x 100 shares x 10 contracts now you try it a $700 call on gme that expires next week costs around seven bucks a share how would you explain to me that you bought two of them you would say that you bought 2 $7 gme $700c 319 now you can look like you know what youre talking about even though you still probably dont why do people buy call options this is confusing why do people even do this people buy call options because you can make a lot of money if you have the right to buy 100 shares of something for a fixed price then for every $1 the share price goes above your breakeven price you make $100 if you have a $400c with a break even of $402 and the price gets to $412 then you make $1000 profit thats $10 of profit $412$402 times 100 shares you can buy the shares and hold them or you can buy them and sell them immediately to realize that profit or you can sell the contract to someone else and just take the money it is usually better to sell the contract but thats not an important distinction because most of you cant afford to exercise anyway and will be selling contracts why are calls dangerous when you buy a stock at least you own the stock if you buy an option and it expires worthless then you have nothing if the guy who bought 90k worth of fds had bought 90k worth of gme and held then hed still have somewhere around 90k worth of gme 5 depending on when he bought on thursday instead he has nothing why does the value of my call keep changing so you bought a call option and every time you look at it its worth a different amount of money thats because there are actually two types of value in an option options have intrinsic value and extrinsic value intrinsic value is the exercisable value of the option if you own a $400c and the price is $412 then the intrinsic value of the option is $12share or $1200 because thats the value you would get if you exercised it right now as stock price goes up intrinsic value goes up pretty easy extrinsic value has a more complicated definition so were going to call extrinsic value the potential the option has and that potential is based on time and volatility for example if there is a long time before expiration then that means that there is more potential for the option to go itm because more time more chances for the price to rise therefore options further from expiration will be worth more than options close to expiration conversely less time to expiration less value which means that your option can constantly lose value as time goes on and the number of chances you have to go itm decreases this is called theta decay but you dont need to worry about that volatility is the second part of extrinsic value and options for stocks that are more volatile can be worth more than options for stocks that trade steadily because if a stock price swings wildly up and down theres a greater chance that one of those upswings will put you itm this is reflected in a measurement called iv or implied volatility like theta decay iv is a more advanced concept that you dont need to understand now as long as you get the basics due to the factors of time theta and volatility iv constantly changing the extrinsic value of your option will also change over time this is why the value of your option will constantly change is the stock calming down and starting to trade sideways low volatility your option value will decrease as iv drops is the stock starting to jump around your option value will increase as iv increases sometimes the stock price can be climbing slowly but the value of your option can be decreasing why do you think that is if the stock value is increasing slowly but youre way otm and running out of time because your option expires tomorrow the downward price pressure of theta decay can overcome the upward price pressure of volatility and stock price rise and your option value can decrease i bought a call and im itm howwhen do i sell my contracts you can sell your contracts at any time you dont have to wait until the expiration to sell your contracts this is good because if the price spikes you can dump your options for profit and move on there was a point yesterday when 90k fd guys 275 and 285 calls were itm when gme spiked to 290 if he had sold then he wouldnt have lost everything by waiting until expiration i bought a call and im itm howwhen do i exercise my contracts make sure that you have enough money to cover buying all the shares and click the exercise button they get your money and you get their shares this can take some time ok i get it but can you give me a tldr just in case i actually dont get it a call option is a contract to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price to buy the contract you pay a premium to the contract seller if the price of the stock goes above the price of your contract you can either buy the shares or sell the contract for profit the end so im an expert now and can go yolo everything on calls and make money no you have a basic understanding of how calls work and know just enough to be dangerous dont go crazy buy a call see how it works for real dont yolo your life savings on your

about $cpng coupang aka amazon of korea aka chef pang aka c piddy because yall need to put some respect on its name its one of the largest tech companies to ipo on the nyse ever $55b and the largest tech ipo in south korean history this isnt just some company its the company some of its notable backers are softbank blackrock bill ackman stanley druckenmiller and david frankel before trying to understand coupang you have to understand south korea as a country ape must read south korea is a firstworld country with the 11th largest economy ie gdp in the world that makes them bigger than russia spain australia mexico indonesia netherlands turkey saudi arabia switzerland poland taiwan sweden belgium thailand argentina nigeria iran you get the point httpsworldpopulationreviewcomcountriescountriesbygdphttpsworldpopulationreviewcomcountriescountriesbygdp they also have the 7th largest ecommerce market in the world httpswwwbusinesscomarticles10ofthelargestecommercemarketsintheworldbhttpswwwbusinesscomarticles10ofthelargestecommercemarketsintheworldb it is also the ultimate turnaround story up until the mid1900s they were a thirdworld japanese colony but in 2021 it is a first world country with one of the largest economies in the world and they did this in about 40 years with their focus on tech and

also just know how advanced they are technologically they have had rfid chips a decade before us theyve had 5g for years they have the best esports gamers in the world they are no stranger to the worldwide web a big reason why they are so successful is because they are 2nd in the world in how much of their national gdp they spend on rampd

getting back to coupang $cpng is only cash flow negative right now because they invested 100s of millions of dollars into their infrastructure allowing them to have 70 of south koreas population 36 million 51 million within 7 miles of their distribution centers they can only do this because 50 of south koreas population lives in the seoul metropolitan area yes 50 fucking percent 25 million people thats like 3 new york cities sidebyside httpsenwikipediaorgwikiseoulcapitalareahttpsenwikipediaorgwikiseoulcapitalarea south koreas annual online sales is $37 billion and ecommerce sales of total retail sales 98 httpswwwbusinesscomarticles10ofthelargestecommercemarketsintheworldbhttpswwwbusinesscomarticles10ofthelargestecommercemarketsintheworldb $cpng sales went from $6b in 2019 to $12b in 2020 92 growth httpswwwfoolcominvesting20210311koreanecommercegiantcoupangskyrocketsonipohttpswwwfoolcominvesting20210311koreanecommercegiantcoupangskyrocketsonipo they also increased their market

httpswwwcnbccom20210311coupangipostrategistsaysinvestorsshouldconsiderprofitoutlookhtmlhttpswwwcnbccom20210311coupangipostrategistsaysinvestorsshouldconsiderprofitoutlookhtml so if the south korean ecommerce market grows at a 224 it will be $142b by 2024 httpswwwcnbccom20210311coupangipostrategistsaysinvestorsshouldconsiderprofitoutlookhtmlhttpswwwcnbccom20210311coupangipostrategistsaysinvestorsshouldconsiderprofitoutlookhtml risks amp rebuttals they sell mostly their own products ok theyve got strong customer loyalty can they expand their business to incorporate more 3rd party sellers in the future potential is there low gross profit margin retail has always historically been a low profit margin business is it possible for them to introduce a new high margin product or service absolutely still cash flow negative did you see the revenue growth $6b to $12b in one year theyre a growth company in its early stages i also mentioned above how theyre investing 100s of millions into their infrastructure distribution centers within 7 miles of 70 of population they dont have aws its not a literal copy of amazon they are also growing their ecommerce business before focusing on anything else sales went from $6b to $12b in one year they need to saturate this market before focusing on anything else its highly likely they will introduce new high profit product or service in the coming years their founder is a harvard drop out they dominate only in south korea whats wrong with that even with the south korean ecommerce market alone $cpng can become a $500b company they are focused on dominating their immediate market im sure theyll create new services and create new sources of revenue once the korean market is saturated theyll figure out a way to expand these south koreans are smart and good at tech dont underestimate them valuation price target if in 2024 $cpng has a 40 market share they will have $57b in sales amazon has 37 market share of us in 2020 with a conservative ps of 4 that puts $cpng fair value at $133 per share $57b sales x 4 $228b valuation if they are doing well and they have hype with a ps of 6 baba has 6 cpang has 7 then $cpng should be $200 per share $57b x 6 $342b valuation and this is if they dont create any new products or services think about that no new products or services just purely their ecommerce business and its still going to be worth $150200 per share if they launch an awslike thing or maybe another service thats just waiting to be discovered theyre going to do an additional $10b easy with the market share they have so add another $50 to the price targets as one of the technologically most advanced countries in the world $cpng is not here to stay its here to takeover south korea conclusion my thesis is heavily dependent on them expanding their business with new high margin productsservices but this is a bet i am willing to make harvard drop out softbank blackrock bill ackman one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world etc i guarantee they will innovate oh and even if its not them developing something internally they can always acquire a company theyre going to do billions in profits soon that is a lot of money its under $50 today with an

mk4pod,pave,4.72%,an investment that will benefit from the infrastructure bill check out $pave etf,discussion,30,0.86,ralphsdiorama,40,if you are looking for an infrastructure investment look not further than $pave etf it’s holdings are well diversified across the physical digital and energy infrastructure found in the bill and options are still very cheap at the moment here is everything you need to know about the etf from seeking alpha the global x us infrastructure development etf pave is in an excellent position to directly benefit from president bidens american jobs plan that was announced on wednesday in pittsburgh pa the proposed plan targets over $14 trillion for direct investments into physical infrastructure including transportation schools hospitals and buildings as well as for energy water and digital infrastructure the pave etf holds many of the companies that will provide the materials tools services and components required for this infrastructure buildout and should handsomely benefit from it investment rationale president biden presented the american jobs plan part of his build back better initiative on wednesday in pittsburgh and the white house published a fact sheet on its website in a nutshell a broad summary of the infrastructure initiatives in the american jobs plan is shown below physical infrastructure transportation infrastructure 621b buildings schools and hospitals 250b infrastructure resilience 50b energy water and digital infrastructure cleantech clean energy and related infra 300b water utilities 111b digital infrastructure 100b in total the aggregate spending targeted directly at these infrastructure projects is over $14 trillion the investment thesis here is simple find an infrastructure fund that can benefit directly from those investment dollars lets take a look at the pave etf and see what its prospects are going forward top holdings the pave infrastructure development etfs top10 holdings can be found on global x etf website and equate to roughly 30 of what i would characterize as a moderately concentrated portfolio that holds a total of 101 companies pave has $23 billion in assets so even a 32 weight of 1 holding deere de results in a $805 million stake many investors would consider deere and odd choice for an infrastructure etf considering it is generally regarded as focused solely on agriculture however de operates in three segments one of which is its construction amp forestry segment this segment manufactures machines for earth moving road building graders excavators material handling crushers and screeners and asphalt pavers de is up 178 over the past year yet has an estimated forward pe of only 233x the 2 holding with a 30 weight is motion control systems specialist parkerhannifin corp ph which operates a diversified industrial segment that provides sealing shielding vibration and thermal solutions as well as filters noise abatement and contaminate removal systems for water air fuel oil and other liquids ph is also up 170 over the past year has a forward pe224x and yields 11 the eaton corp etn is the 3 holding and has 30 weight within the portfolio eaton pays a $304 annual dividend yields 22 and has a forward pe249x the company is heavily involved in the power management sector and likely will provide many of the electrical components and assemblies needed to build out the electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure detailed in the american jobs plans investments into clean tech and clean energy the 4 5 and 10 holdings are railroad companies norfolk southern nsc kansas city southern ksu and csx corp csx along with 12 holding union pacific unp these four holdings alone equate to 115 of the entire portfolio obviously this etf is betting that these rail freight providers will be hauling much of the gravel rock asphalt lumber steel and products and assemblies that will be needed to build out the infrastructure of roads bridges buildings and energy and water systems as detailed in the ajp these railroads will also benefit from opening up and a generally stronger economy some of that has been fueled by the excellent progress the biden administration and bigpharma when it comes to the vaccine rollout and as a result from general expectations that the us economy is opening up fast and will see very strong growth in the 2h of the year meantime canadian pacific cp recently offered to buy ksu for $25 billion which has added some merger mania to the sector surprisingly the fund does not hold caterpillar cat cat is generally thought to be one of the main beneficiaries of an infrastructure bill but considering that stock has doubled over the past year perhaps the management team feels it is overvalued but with a forward pe283x and a 18 yield cat seems to be an odd omission in my opinion looking through the rest of the portfolio see the full list of holdings here we find many of the companies that sell the raw materials steel aluminum copper lumber asphalt filters etc needed to for as the basic building blocks for transportation electrical utility and water infrastructure performance pave etf wins by a considerable margin over ifra on a nav basis and neither etf pays that much in the way of income 064 and 14 respectively pave is 9x the size of ifra which has $250 million in aum over a shorter timeframe that encompasses the yearofcovid19 and the period when discussions about an infrastructure bill to get americans back to work with goodpaying jobs got serious pave has also outperformed the ifra etf by a significant margin fund basics these metrics all come from the global x pave etf webpage expense ratio 047 aum $23 billion pe ratio 322x forward pe ratio 219x pricetobook 36x 30day secyield 064 roughly 87 of the fund is invested in the industrials and materials sectors risks considering the strong rally the pave etf has had over the past year in anticipation of the infrastructure bill much has already been built into the price that said note the fund is not overweight any highflying cleanenergy names and despite the growth of some of these stocks many still sell at very reasonable valuation levels see the forward pes of some of the top holding discussed earlier the biggest risk is getting a substantial the american jobs plan through congress it should get through the democratically controlled house in roughly the same shape as presented as we learned with the american rescue plan despite the objections of some of the more progressive members of the democratic party they have shown some level of pragmatism in that they know if the legislation doesnt get through the very narrowly controlled senate it wont matter what they pass in the house much is likely to depend on what senator joe manchin dwest virginia decides he will support as if history is any indication the ajp will get zero republicans votes so the democrats must get all 50votes so that vice president harris can break the tie i believe the democrats will push the legislation through because a recent poll by navigator recently found broad bipartisan support over 80 for an infrastructure bill by american voters tldr summary amp conclusion for those investors that dont typically invest in the infrastructure sector myself included but want to have some exposure to where their tax dollars are going in the american jobs plan the pave etf seems like an excellent choice the portfolio is full of solidly profitable companies that are reasonably valued and in an excellent position to benefit from the buildout of us infrastructure pave is a buy,2021-04-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mk4pod/an_investment_that_will_benefit_from_the/
mk5h3m,none,n/a,the us govt has a huge incentive to massively underreport inflation,discussion,171,0.93,natural_profession_8,823,tldr the us federal government has a massive incentive to underreport inflation a 1 underreporting of inflation saves the us govt between $500 billion and $1 trillion per year its likely that such a huge moral hazard has led the government to systematically underreport inflation over the past few decades for background the bureau of labor statistics bls calculates inflation it releases a measure known as the consumer price index or cpi the formula used to calculate cpi is rather complex and opaque and has been changed numerous times over the years the effect of these changes has been to lower the average reported inflation number 1httpswwwinvestopediacomarticles07consumerpriceindexasp many government revenues and expenditures are inflationlinked either directly or indirectly directly linked 1 social security payments social security payments are linked to a measure known as cpiw very similar to the cpi 2httpswwwssagovoactcolacolasummaryhtml every year the amount a social security recipient receives goes up in proportion to the amount of inflation it has been estimated that the social security program has total unfunded liabilities worth $37 trillion every 1 of underreported inflation decreases the real value of these unfunded liabilities by $370 billion 2 tax brackets tax brackets are adjusted upwards to account for inflation 3httpswwwinvestopediacomaskanswers111715aretaxbracketsadjustedinflationasp this means when the government underreports inflation more people move up into higher tax brackets its hard to calculate the exact effect of this on government revenues 3 treasury inflationprotected securities these are treasuries that increase the amount they pay back in both interest and principle according to inflation they are linked to the cpi these securities known as tips compromise 8 of the us federal debt 4httpswwwtreasurygovresourcecenterfinmktspagestipsaspx this is $224 trillion every 1 of underreported inflation decrease the real value of the principle of this debt by $22 billion there are also increases to the interest payments on this debt indirectly linked 1 debt interest payments investors will demand higher returns from treasuries in periods where they expect higher inflation the us government has $26 trillion in treasury debt the yearly cost of servicing this debt is 12 of that roughly $378 billion in 2020 if investors were to expect higher inflation this yearly cost would go up by $260 billion for every 1 increase in expected inflation there are likely many other government programs that benefit from underreporting inflation these are just the main ones i could find when we add up all these policies we see that underreporting inflation by just 1 can save the government between $500 billion and $1 trillion a year this is 30 of the entire tax revenue of the us government underreporting inflation by 34 a year would save the government more money than it brings in from taxes every year evidence of underreporting there has probably never been a time in history when such a massive moral hazard existed and was not exploited is there any evidence that the us government has in fact been understating inflation 1 changes to the cpi formula originally the cpi was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods in this case the cpi was a cost of goods index cogi however over time the us congress embraced the view that the cpi should reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living1﻿ consequently the cpi has evolved into a cost of living index coli over the years the methodology used to calculate the cpi has undergone numerous revisions according to the bls the changes removed biases that caused the cpi to overstate the inflation rate the new methodology takes into account changes in the quality of goods and substitution substitution the change in purchases by consumers in response to price changes changes the relative weighting of the goods in the basket﻿ the overall result tends to be a lower cpi however critics view the methodological changes and the switch from a cogi to a coli as a purposeful manipulation that allows the us government to report a lower cpi 5httpswwwinvestopediacomarticles07consumerpriceindexasp essentially the methodology used to calculate the cpi was changed to purposefully reduce the amount of inflation that is reported when a good is considered to be of increased quality its price increase is lowered to reflect this when the price of one good goes up its relative weighting in the cpi is reduced and another lowerpriced good is substituted for it 2 rent in 2005 the average us rent was $755 in 2019 it was $1164 6httpswwwdeptofnumberscomrentus this is an increase of 54 or an average yearly increase of 31 during the same time the cpi has gone from 1916 to 2524 7httpsfredstlouisfedorgseriescpiaucsl which is only a 31 increase or an average yearly increase of 19 if we use rent as the true measure of inflation cpi has underreported inflation by 11 per year keep in mind that during the period just mentioned the us experienced the most epic collapse in housing prices it had ever seen during the 20072008 crisis the housing bubble was already far along by 2005 8httpsfredstlouisfedorgseriescsushpisa nonetheless rent increases managed to outstrip the cpi what do you think is the us government massively

mkal7x,a,7.13%,the uranium bull thesis is playing out to perfection a $500bn market is emerging a multiyear run for the equities is inevitable,dd,29,0.84,booonclay,218,with so many exciting developments of late i wanted to share my 02 on the current state of the uranium market focusing a bit on swu which i am very fond of haha as always i look forward to any feedback as am sure all are aware we have seen a 15 jump in spot over last 2 weeks while the increase was in large part to nonproducing mines physical purchasing i noticed a number of discussions on reddit and various discord servers stocktwits also seeming to suggest that this uptick in spot u was indicative of where we are in the current fuel cycle experienced investors in this sector will tell you however that this couldn’t be further from the truth rather a more powerful indicator as to where we are in the cycle is by looking at the swu enrichment price based in large part on swu projections many expert investors are forecasting a $500bn market for perspective during the last cycle the market peaked at $150bn so what is swu for those very new to uranium investing a very quick overview might be helpful also for those more familiar than i am i appreciate the feedback swu short for separative work unit is a measure for the cost of enrichment generally speaking when swu prices are low utilities benefit by purchasing excess enrichment inventory at cheap prices using intermediaries ie carry trades conversely a rise in swu signifies that the demand for enrichment is growing as excess inventories are utilized by end users the utilities no longer aided by the secondary market instead turn to the uranium producers to purchase future contracts at much higher prices it follows logically that higher enrichment prices force the utilities to retreat back into the fuel cycle from conversion uf6 and even fabricated fuel purchasing to the beginning ie spot u308 which in turn drives those spot prices up additionally and perhaps most importantly higher swu prices on future contracts are essential in incentivizing the mines to come back online mcarthur and cigar lake for example need at least the $40s and for paladin likely in the $50s in order to justify their operational costs therefore swu is arguably the best indicator of where we are in the fuel cycle even when there are false startsspikes in the market which we’ve seen in the past couple years swu price is consistent what is the current swu price swu bottomed out at $34 in august 2018 after so much excess accumulated in the years following fukushima since hitting that low swu has been on a relative straight line upwards currently estimated at $54 this steady growth over the past 25 years is one of if not the most compelling reason investors are so confident of a long bull market to come in this sector so how the is swu forecasting a $500bn market of course there are a number of things we can look at that are driving this thing its becoming almost a daily occurrence now to see catalysts emerging ie breaking news this week on eu green energy qualifications the white house endorsing nuclear in as part of the clean energy standard however moreso than anything swu is at the core of the bull thesis which is that decarbonization of the electrical grid around the world is not possible without nuclear power duke energy corp just said the same yesterday as swu prices continue to rise it is inevitable that equity prices will follow denison is a fun example even now im still amazed at how many people claiming to have thousands of shares of certain uranium producers are surprised when they hear that denison isnt actually producing any uranium when utilities start executing term contracts with other producers at swu in the $60s $70s $80s and beyond those mines will turn the lights back on the fact that they just bought spot above market is a pretty powerful indication of where things are headed as far as volume on these long term contracts it wont be long before denison’s prices start to rise the same idea goes with cominak ranger etc moreover what happens when weve exhausted cigar lake and kazatomprom or mcarthur river it isnt just that we have a rising demand we need new projects coming into existence now in order to avoid a huge deficit in supply between 20252030 the investment opportunities on these projects are extremely exciting and why $500bn frankly i think $500bn is conservative though something in this vicinity i have seen as the consensus among many experts market cap for publicly traded uranium is at 125bn right now and this is only the very beginning ultimately there are new players in the game with a ton of liquidity ie hedge funds and they are looking for value taking $urnm as one example the aum just months ago when it ipod was a few million now aum is $175mm we also cannot ignore what is happening in china it is a huge growth story there there is also a spec frenzy but again looking at the big picture moreso than anything else i keep going back to swu for me it is the most powerful predictor of the multiyear bull run to come and while there will always be doubtful retail who to their credit have rightfully called false starts over the last couple years you cannot deny what 25 years of rising swu enrichment prices means for

leyrrr,gme,-16.49%,how 75 of gme shares are still shorted s3 is wrong,dd,9,0.8,nxb123,259,first off this is my opinion based on the facts available this is by no means financial advice i am not a financial advisor if you are not familiar with edgar it is the sec’s database for various types of company filings one of those filings is called the 13g “the securities and exchange commission sec schedule 13g form is an alternative filing for the schedule 13d form and is used to report a partys ownership of stock which exceeds 5 of a companys total stock issue schedule 13g is a shorter version of schedule 13d with fewer reporting requirements” when a company decides to dispose of beneficial ownership of stock and holds more then 5 of shares available they are required to amend the filing 13g making it the 13ga when these documents are submitted they are filed under both the beneficial owner and issuer of stock in edgar in the case of gamestop’s “short squeeze” and understanding the exchange of shares during that time period blackrock inc blk was the only institutional holder owning over 5 of shares that liquidated their position so far blackrock inc liquidated 9217335 shares of gamestop on 1262021 httpswwwsecgovedgarsearchreldaterangecustomampciks0001364742ampentitynameblackrock2520inc2520blk2520cik25200001364742ampstartdt20160126ampenddt20210127amppage5httpswwwsecgovedgarsearchreldaterangecustomampciks0001364742ampentitynameblackrock2520inc2520blk2520cik25200001364742ampstartdt20160126ampenddt20210127amppage5 controlf gamestop blackrock is the second largest institutional holder of gme behind fmr llc with 9534090 shares according to yahoo finance so… you are probably wondering “how many shares of gme do the top 10 institutions hold combined ” httpsfinanceyahoocomquotegmeholderspgmehttpsfinanceyahoocomquotegmeholderspgme let’s count fmr llc 9534090 blackrock inc 9217335 according to 13ga vanguard group inc 5288507 susquehanna international group llp 4444128 dimensional fund advisors lp 3948114 senvest management llc 3225740 state street corporation 2609487 morgan stanley 1995842 paradice investment management llc 1832526 norges bank investment management 1811792 total 25472891 shares of gme or 254734689 54 of float shares ampx200b on the same yahoo finance page where we found ‘top institutional holder’ data if you scroll down you can see ‘top mutual fund holders’ combined these funds hold 18754689 40 of float shares note that two of these mutual funds own over 5 of shares meaning they would need to file with the sec if they were to sell these two mutual funds hold 22 of float shares accounting for blackrock’s liquidation 54 of shares are held by the top 10 institutional holders at the moment lets say worst case scenario only the two biggest mutual funds are left holding shares making that 22 of float shares so far we have accounted for 76 of all shares the last data we have on short interest is 122 of float shares the media has reported numbers as low as 33 short interest post squeeze according to s3 partners mathematically this is impossible if short interest is truly 33 that means these institutional holders would have filed a 13ga… but they didn’t…meaning they did not sell this means that there is still at a minimum 76 of float shares shorted this is very high and could cause another squeeze tldr as you know lots of bagholders around the world are not selling it just so happens that we are not alone we have some of the biggest institutions bagholding with us minimum 76 of float shares in fact if you thought that we were the only greedy and vengeful mfs out there you are sorrily mistaken these institutions ie fidelity vanguard morgan stanley want to see this second squeeze just as much as you until then hold the line,2021-02-07,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leyrrr/how_75_of_gme_shares_are_still_shorted_s3_is_wrong/

lglrg5,gme,259.43%,naked shorting in gme and how the pieces suddenly fit together,dd,1912,0.96,rainforest11,1729,tldr hard to distill it into tldr but essentially a lot of pieces clicking together if you believe there was naked shorting in gme and there is strong evidence to support that theory i know ape cant read but i implore you to read the whole thing i was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of gme which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to gme i was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes this is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle i could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now one of the interesting things about gme and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by finra to be 226 and later in the range of 150 percent of total float another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of ftids httpswherearethesharescomhttpswherearethesharescom both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal in addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example httpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsle235tgmeinstitutionshold177offloatwhythehttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsle235tgmeinstitutionshold177offloatwhythe where do these shares come from one potential explanation is synthetic long shares created via a loophole described here httpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsleorksevidencepointstogmeshortsnothavingcoveredhttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsleorksevidencepointstogmeshortsnothavingcovered or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting i’m an entrepreneur not a finance expert so i started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject i started with this httpswwwsecgovinvestorpubsregshohtmhttpswwwsecgovinvestorpubsregshohtm “failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale there may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver for example human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than bookentry form thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal threeday settlement period a fail may also result from “naked” short selling” interesting we have a consistent and very high rate of ftids dating from 2020 and beyond an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time according to former chairman of the sec christopher cox “abusive naked short sales can be used as a tool to drive down a companys stock price to the detriment of all of its investors the commission is particularly concerned about persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the commissions regulation sho adopted just two years ago… selling short without having stock available for delivery and intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard threeday settlement period is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws… we are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities specifically these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership voting lending and dividends from issuers moreover they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling which could be used as a tool to drive down a companys stock price source httpswwwsecgovnewsspeech2006spch071206cc2htmhttpswwwsecgovnewsspeech2006spch071206cc2htm in a different speech mr cox reiterated that short selling helps prevent irrational exuberance and bubbles but when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it” mr cox also “referred to the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “a tool to drive down a companys stock price and that the sec is concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in regulation sho which reminds me of this piece i wrote httpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsleorksevidencepointstogmeshortsnothavingcoveredhttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsleorksevidencepointstogmeshortsnothavingcovered source for sec chairman’s words httpswwwsecgovnewsspeech2008spch071808cchtmhttpswwwsecgovnewsspeech2008spch071808cchtm as another datapoint robert j shapiro former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1000 companies into the ground source this was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted httpstimecomtimemagazinearticle091711126706300htmlhttpstimecomtimemagazinearticle091711126706300html but the statement still exists in record in an sec filing from 2008 httpswwwsecgovcommentss70808s70808170htmhttpswwwsecgovcommentss70808s70808170htm i also read ‘one complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a companys shares for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books this has been alleged to create phantom or counterfeit shares sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares and artificially depressing the share price’” shortly after i read that matt taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both bear sterns and lehman brothers taibbi said that the two firms got a push into extinction from a flatout counterfeiting scheme called naked shortselling source httpswwwrollingstonecompoliticsstory30481512wallstreetsnakedswindlehttpswwwrollingstonecompoliticsstory30481512wallstreetsnakedswindle all these sources above seem to support the theory that gme stock was wildly naked shorted which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed if investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage gme was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen potentially even an infinite short squeeze on 126 elon tweeted about gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of wsb the goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze on 128 thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pretrading started the stock shot up to 513 in pretrading and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day the momentum was suddenly shut down when robinhood where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on were shut off from the ability to buy gme stock and only allow selling followed by several other brokers many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying but funds were not when this happened people were upset at robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between robinhood and citadel which along with point72 invested a lifeline of 25 billion to melvin capital one of the short side funds and is also responsible for something like 40 of robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books but many also speculated collusion with dtcc itself now personally speaking its kind of crazy to think about dtcc being complicit in something like this however looking into the details of what happened a skeptical part of me became suspicious apparently what triggered the shut down on trading gme on that day was dtcc sending a letter at 4 am to robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars httpsfortunecom20210202robinhoodgamestoprestrictedtradingmemestocksgmeamcvladtenevnscchttpsfortunecom20210202robinhoodgamestoprestrictedtradingmemestocksgmeamcvladtenevnscc so it sounds like it was essentially this dtcc letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on gme and the short squeeze happening on that day there were theories thrown out that dtcc was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of gme and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow backscandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag worse dtcc would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing i imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least then i read something that caught my eye… dtcc has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts from an article dating back to 2007 “depository trust amp clearing corp is a littleknown institution in the nations stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job it is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers about 99 of the time trades are completed without incident but about 1 of the shares valued at about $25 billion on a given a day arent delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days for one reason or another these failures to deliver have put dtcc in the middle of a longrunning fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies share prices” source httpswwwwsjcomarticlessb118359867562957720httpswwwwsjcomarticlessb118359867562957720 apparently the dtcc has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time according to wall street journal “there is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens the fight is over how prevalent the problem is and the extent to which dtcc is responsible some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame dtcc as the keepers of the system where it happens dtcc and others say it isnt widespread enough to be a major concern” source httpswwwwsjcomarticlessb118359867562957720httpswwwwsjcomarticlessb118359867562957720 as a thought experiment lets say naked shorting is rampant in gme many many indicators point to this and lets say dtcc was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on gme wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces something to consider because had they not done what they did on 129 thursday many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day from the wall street journal “the securities and exchange commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice the latest move came last month when the sec further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale but some critics argue the sec still hasnt done enough… some delivery failures linger for weeks or months until that failure is resolved there are effectively additional shares of a companys stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyers account critics say this phantom stock can put downward pressure on a companys share price by increasing the supply… critics contend dtcc has turned a blind eye to the nakedshorting problem” source httpswwwwsjcomarticlessb118359867562957720httpswwwwsjcomarticlessb118359867562957720 from everything i’ve seen as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 126 many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented i personally hold the following hypothesis gme shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221 and 150 at various times and as late as 129 reported by s3 to be 122 httpstwittercomihors3status1355246955874701314httpstwittercomihors3status1355246955874701314 gme shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs httpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsleorksevidencepointstogmeshortsnothavingcoveredhttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsleorksevidencepointstogmeshortsnothavingcovered and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering which is illegal to cover using this particular method and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close as a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more gme shares then the actual float the counterfeit shares canhave been used in aggressive naked short attackshttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentslf4vn3yesladderingisrealshortladderattackisjust to further drive down the price of gme which may have led to the precipiotous price drop starting last monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shareshttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsleorksevidencepointstogmeshortsnothavingcovered due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to dtcc which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in gme there was potentially collusion on 129 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby dtcc may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed edit someone asked so what’s the current short position looks like they some how covered pasting my response below because id like people to see ive heard people say 78 thats still a high number but personally i made the decision not to care about this percentage from the short interest report released today correct me if im wrong that number is generated from data hedge funds submit and hedge funds in this context have every incentive to submit data that would favor their current position apparently the fine they get for submitting false is nothing more than a slap on the wrista small fine i also believe hedge funds may have covered some shorts illegally using a loophole to generate synthetic longs to cover with more on that on my post herehttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsleorksevidencepointstogmeshortsnothavingcovered in addition there seems to have been some fuckeryhttpswwwredditcomuserrubinoffbuttchug69commentslfdcv1fintelchangedtheirshortvolumedataaftermy i recommend you give this a read with short interest numbers lately so for those reason i dont

lgqk6s,gme,258.67%,gme sucks,dd,159,0.86,randomguyfromsweden2,384,fucking sike you thought i meant it retard nah i got diamond hands till the day i die and this is why gme short percentage of float is 117 crunching the short interest numbers gather round diamond handed apes and crayon eating retards there is a lot of confusion about what short interest from the short interest report today actually means here is how it breaks down todays reported short interest is 7846 short interest is the percentage of short shares of the outstanding shares outstanding shares means all the shares of the stock including restricted shares and shares held by insiders gme has 69750000 outstanding shares 7846 of those outstanding shares is 54725850 shares so as of the settlement date of 129 there were 54725850 shorted shares out there that need to be covered by comparison the number of shorted shares from the 115 report was 61780000 so since the 115 report to the 129 only 7054150 shorts were covered got it so far ok here is the good shit float is the number of shares that are available to trade float is the number of outstanding shares minus the restricted shares and the shares held by insiders gme float is 46890000 so the short float percentage is the number of shorted stocks 54735850 divided by the float 46890000 x 100 so the short percentage of float is 117 thats right the 129 report tells us that the short stocks are 117 of the available gme stock did you all hear me the next part is the really good shit lets take a a look at the 7054150 shorts that were covered between the 115 report and the 129 report the short interest report from 129 is from the settlement date not the trading date it takes two days for settlement so the short interest you see is actually from trading through 127 likewise the 115 report is from trading through 113 ok according to todays report 7054150 shorts were covered between 113 and 127 so what happened during that period on 113 gme opened at 2042 and closed at 3140 on january 27 gme closed at 34751 that is an increase of 32709 that is an increase of just over 1600 of course everyone knows what happened on the following day the price shot up to 450 the dtc increased margins and shut down retail buyers only 7054150 shares were covered during that 1600 increase in gme stonks some of that increase must have been due to people jumping on the bandwagon so the increase probably isnt completely due to the short squeeze that had started tldr the short interest report today shows us that on there was 112 more shares shorted than were actually available to purchase on 12721 between 113 and 127 on about 7 million shorts were covered the hedges are fucked they have been shorting like crazy since 127 because they were really bleeding by that point they had to keep the price down and try to reduce retail purchases and holdings by all the shit we have seen in the subs on twitter and tv nothing has changed the squeeze has not happened yet buy hold peace everything is written by ujoethejedi67 support him not me saw that his post got deleted and wanted to help edit tldr💎💎🙌🙌🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,2021-02-10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgqk6s/gme_sucks/

lh2ng0,kt,19.67%,the real deep fucking value – kt corporation,dd,272,0.83,clubba,975,apparently we’re all saying this now but i am not a financial advisor and you should do your own dd with that being said i present you with the following i’m a fan of dfv the man but i’m more interested in really really deep fucking value this will likely be a long post but i think you’ll find value in it if you can follow along see what i did there for those of you kids who can’t read good i’ll put the tldr right here at the top kt corp $kt is so undervalued it’s almost fucking embarrassing when i say undervalued i don’t mean by a little bit… i mean if this thing doubled it would still be a good value at the time of my writing this kt is trading at $1062 a realistic price target if the market were to properly value this company is $3000 i’ll go in depth as to why as we continue through this story but the long and short of it is the tangible book value of kt corporation is $1966share what does that mean it means if kt declared bankruptcy tomorrow was forced to sell off all of its tangible assets and pay back its debt the remaining money to be returned to shareholders would be $1966share this does not take into consideration intangible assets – which have real value in the $billions but are harder to assess again it’s trading at $1062 as of this writing a pricetangible book value of only 054 value investors typically look for stocks trading at lt30 pricetbv deep value would be lt10 kt is trading at 054 and a pricebook ratio of 042 shares are cheap options are cheap do what you will – hell sell it short if you want – but i like shares and calls kt corporate profile kt corporation formerly korea telecom is a south korean integrated telecom conglomerate which was founded in 1885 – but realistically in 1981 in a more noticeable form – with business operations sprinkled throughout asia africa usa amp poland kt is south korea’s first telecom company and dominates korean market share in many of the spaces in which they compete line of business of korean market share mobile services 314 fixedline local telephone amp voip 649 broadband internet access 409 pay tv services 316 as a conglomerate kt has their hands in a number of diversified pots products amp services of total revenue mobile services incl 5g 273 fixedline incl voip broadband data comm 195 media

httpsiimgurcomsyxirxyjpeg kt has 30 institutional ownership with blackrock being a large buyer in q4 2020 kt has also filed paperwork for a massive share repurchase program for what it’s worth in this day and age the short of shares outstanding is a measly 009 no one is going short on this thing at its current price you’d literally have to be insane to short it – it’d be like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller financial metrics amp peer comparisons kt’s balance sheet is rock solid while it may not have the booming high growth of clean tech or cannabis it is still growing and maybe more importantly doing so profitably i touched on the tangible book value in the tldr above but this cannot be understated if you were to liquidate the company entirely shareholders would receive $2030 per share after the debt had been repaid i have highlighted some comparison ratios in the images below to show the truly disgusting undervaluation of kt compared to usbased telecom services index peers httpsiimgurcomiome5mijpeg using a comp multiple for valuation based on these index comps gives the following implied value per share for kt ranging from $2633 $10988 unrealistic top end httpsiimgurcom0hyg7zyjpeg compared to industry peerscomps httpsiimgurcomlt8upvhjpeg the following comparison is really the tale of the tape when we look at tangible book value we see that all of the peers are trading above the tangible book value this is obvious given the share price should exceed the liquidation value but we see the opposite being true for kt again it is trading at half of its tangible book value you could theoretically buy up all of the existing shares liquidate the company and double your money this is what i mean by real deep fucking value httpsiimgurcomvgavp9bjpeg not that we put much weight in them around here but all of the analysts are bullish on kt as well with median upside of 33 httpsiimgurcombuhxpqqjpeg they just published their updated earnings presentation and have positive forecasts for growth as well httpscorpktcomengattachrecord2020kt20er20pt204q2020engfinpdf i am long shares and 071621 $15 calls everyone looks for the tldr at the bottom i put it at the top of the post but here it is massively undervalued $30share realistic price target its trading at half of its tangible book value meaning you could theoretically buy up all of the shares liquidate the companys tangible assets pay back the debt and be left with 2x your money and still have all of the intangible assets this is real

their system is called senhance essentially a robotic device pokes some holes in your tummy and without opening you up for good some little arms with tools cameras light are introduced in your poor

utilize conventional laparoscopic 5 and 10mm trocars stands out in comparison to the da vinci® robotic system which incorporates its own 8 and 12mm ports 27httpslinkspringercomarticle101007s11701019009809refcr27 since fully reusable instruments are used by this surgical robotic system an advantage regarding cost efficacy is expected when compared to the da vinci® system excluding the acquisition costs of the senhance™ surgical robotic system the robotspecific cost per case at our department was 800 euros covering the expenses for drapes instruments and maintenance according to a flat ratebased service contract this comes in contrast to costs as high as 1700 euros for drapes and instruments with da vinci® robotic system while excluding maintenance and acquisition costs and another paper httpslinkspringercomarticle1010072fs11701019010006httpslinkspringercomarticle1010072fs11701019010006 this paper is not accessible for free so let me just copy the conclusions for you autists to salivate gtour experience with diferent types of robotic surgeries allows us to state that the senhance® robotic system is feasible and safe for

tree am i right ampx200b cool cool so whatchu holdin homey tillllllray aw yiss aphria yeah she fine as hell cgc oh lawd dat ass is bangin acb aw man you like the classics thats dope ogi into the up and comers respect young blood sndl ampx200b sndl for real dude ampx200b hi all nrdrage here you might remember me from such hits as pegging $gme dead right multiple times during its bubble making everybody rich on $riot exposing the $plug infinite money glitch accidentally helping start the $bb craze never getting an $amd weekly call right and being in an abusive relationship with the vix or maybe the sec and you how you can just say no to having them shove a mister fister up your ass alright apes its been a great few days being able to throw a dart at a wall of weed stocks and no matter where it sticks you make money its been a great run but if youre going to expand the acreage of your jungle and the amount of lady gorillas you earn the right to mate with you gotta start thinking a bit and that means hear me out thinking of how the hell you plan on getting out of sndl alive and yes i realize im saying this right after it spiked almost a hundo percent in the last 24 hours look i was playing it too i grabbed some 219 3cs and a shit ton of 122 15cs on tuesday i also got out of both of those today though not as high up as i could have if you check my history youll see i even said i was goingt to eye a reentry then the market took a giant dump and gave me that entry but i passed on it because i had done some research by that point whatever profits profit ampx200b heres the tldr its basically a penny stock thats gotten pumped to hell but the smart ape realizes when something has gone too mainstream and gets out of the way before the bulldozers wipe out his trees ampx200b hey i love shoving a share price around a bit as much as the next guy i aint gonna talk shit about that but it seems like nobody has an exit strategy for this and im starting to see a lot of really stupid shit about holding to 4269 and all the other ridiculous bullshit from people who clearly dont even know what they fuck theyve invested in that the gme gibbons fell for ampx200b heres the reality of sndl ampx200b the company was on the verge of bankruptcy around thanksgiving they have no other markets other than canada which is ridiculously oversaturated with weed to the point that wholesale prices are less than a dollar a gram and they recently got forced to admit that their product fails to meet thc content requirements ampx200b in case youre wondering what that means it means they sell skunkweed that they cut with paper and sawdust to make it cheaper they sell garbage and everyone knows it their brand is associated with low quality crap ampx200b plus they actively solicited us to buy their stock to drive up the price then diluted it to fuck with a billion share offering now to their credit this not only enabled them to become debt free but also up their marketing budget and spend some time trying to create a brand dont get too excited fucking sams choice at walmart is a brand too doesnt mean you should stick a chub of their ground beef up your rectum by reason of them selling skunkweed their margins lag well behind that of their competitors ampx200b looking at their financials theyve got 615 million in cash laying around thats pretty good except theyre a company that burns 250 million a quarter which means theyre going to dilute the fuck out of everyone again next month theyve got no exposure to the us market but had no problem dropping rumors that they were going to break in to the us market through licensing deals which turned out to be 1 pot shop in bellingham washington they have no real expansion plan anywhere in the world for that matter ampx200b bbubububut nrdrage stonk go up look at it sndl to the moon 🚀 🚀 🚀 ampx200b yeah i know its fucking crazy to talk shit about a stock when its seemingly mid flight but here i am anyways not to talk you out of the weed party you should totally keep playing that for all its worth but rather to get people to see that theyve probably outgrown skunkweed now ampx200b look the reason this thing mooned is because it was like a dollar hell it was 13 cents not too far back with a stock worth a dollar its easy to get a lot of other apes to throw a couple of bananas at it for the lulz its easy to shove around a penny stock with an extra 10 bucks you have laying around from another trade somewhere but as the price goes up so too goes up the perceived cost of entering i can make a strong unassailable in fact argument that $apha at $25 is cheaper than sndl at 325 but people are conditioned to like smaller numbers unfortunately as the gme gibbons learned eventually you run out of buyers and then things go tits up real fast ampx200b as the prophet biggie smalls once said mo money equals mo problems we all know this equation to be true and here you are sitting on bags of bananas you didnt know you were gonna have a week ago thanks to some stonk you hadnt heard of before yesterday you dont think youve got a problem but you do because those bags of bananas arent edible until you turn them in to the bank for real cash if youre sitting on bananas from the gold standard of the weed world that would be $tlry youre resting pretty easy that no other ape is gonna come by and steal your bananas there are gonna be lots of bananas to go around and mostly were just taking bananas from fools who think their bananas will be less later but you dont have that with sndl all the bananas are currently sitting with people who think the bananas will go higher you cant all be right especially when there are billions of bananas and now your grandparents are starting to buy bananas because some boomer on cnbc told them it would make their dick bigger and their friends think they were cooler ampx200b again im not telling you to leave the party ampx200b but if you recall your dorm room years the best pizza you could afford was the tonys school lunchroom style shit for a dollar then you managed to hide a few bucks from the people who collect your student loans and you upgraded to dominos maybe by now youre ordering from a local joint that makes its own dough in house and the sauce is made with the love of an old italian grandma who accidentally dips her sagging tiddies into the pot 3 times while making it that just makes it taste better thats science but i digress ampx200b the point is you can get better weed now you dont have to smoke the skunk so before you get the rug pulled out from beneath you and are stuck investing in shitty penny stocks again maybe you should elevate your enterprise lets take a look at your options ampx200b canopy growth you could go with $cgc they not only sell higher quality weed but are an established brand and also sell oils and shit to those hippie fucks who still think burning man isnt just a brogrammer beatfest and go to an acupuncturist to enhance their luck theyve captured that all important 65 stoner demographic by marketing their shit as a cure for seizures cataracts and dry vag so theyve got a lot of revenue theyve also had a much more muted rise this week because they just havent been on everybodys lips which means theyve got a lot of room to run the downside here is they burn almost as much cash as sndl but theyve also got more bullets ampx200b aurora if you go with $acb youre going with a company thats already gone through its shady as fuck stage and has reemerged healthy from it youre also not only getting on weed but the diy urban chicken farmer types who want to grow their own weed they too have had a strong run but have a lot more runway than most because theyve actually got a really strong path to dominance in the us market once it opens up to them ampx200b organigram ampx200b look if your dick is still getting hard at the thought of playing a low dollar stonk or youve only got 28 dollars to invest you could do a lot worse theyve got strong branding large growth potential a management structure that doesnt seem to act shady and theyve run almost as well as the other new generation of meme stonks but lagged back enough because nobody can fucking rmeember their name to where they can rubber band a bit ampx200b tilray and aphria ampx200b im combining these because theyre inexorably joined at the hip or should be more on that later because the two of them are merging for those who dont know sometime in q2 every share of $apha you own will turn into 833 shares of $tlry even though apha is the one buying out tlry this is basically the gold standard of weed stonkery when you start investing in these you know youre a real investor ampx200b heres the interesting thing with these guys though even though aphia should be just slightly trailing behind tlry in terms of stock price its currently trading at less than half with tlry sitting at 73 a share as i write this apha should be at just over $60 but its at 29 now obviously this means that tlry has a lot more momentum and some of that is due to the fact that theres a mini dont flog me for using the word but its true short squeeze going on with that one which has turned it into such a strong momentum play but apha by virtue of actual math needs to be within about 17 of tlrys price which means apha either needs to moon dramatically or tlry needs to fall precipitously now either of those things could happen but the momentum of tlry is hard to stop which means its more likely that apha rubber bands to catch up to it in the coming months even if tlry does falter that means apha still has to come up a bit to meet it making apha kind of a cant go tits up situation tlry also has the benefit of having enough market cap to where fund bois will buy into it whereas sndl is too small to meet most of their requirements which can further propel tlry and thus drag apha with it ampx200b one of the interesting things thats been happening with this pair is that the order books even though they should mirror one another have completely inverted from one another numerous times in the last couple of days this of course was a bull flag for tlry every time it happened leaving apha to compensate to try and catch back up shortly thereafter its really easy money ampx200b fundamentally these guys have one huuuuuuuge advantage over the others they secured the uk distribution and now have the inside track to be the supplier for the rest of the europoors across the pond who need to smoke a bond to help forget all the things wrong with them and if you dont think they wont be able to leverage that to be the front runners out of the gate when the us opens for business then you definitely aint black ampx200b or you can just stay where you are and do the 💎👐 thing ampx200b ask the $gme gibbons how well that worked out for them the ones still holding that stonk are like that one dude sitting at the edge of the bar of the viper room still rocking his mullet and chain wallet just convinced that warrant and slaughter are going to ring in the glory days of hair metal once more and that queensryche is going to start selling out stadiums again its just sad youre flying right now but a rug is gonna get pulled out from under you and then youre gonna have your own daily thread where you reassure yourselves that its gonna be ok and that youre gonna ride it to a thousand one day lots of us myself included made a fuck ton of money on gme and weve made a fuck ton on sndl and the rest of the weedies this week but there are always people who melvin it and hang on to their position too long and get stuck thats gonna be a lot of you but you shouldnt let it be you ampx200b tldr smart apes should look at their much bigger pile of bananas from sndl while youre way ahead and upgrade them to plantains before the other apes plaintains equals breeding with better apes not low quality apes

lhb2z5,a,6.70%,a strong case for the tlry shorts dont be left holding a bag,dd,36,0.86,metrics_man,415,tldr are you really going to tell me that a merged tilray and aphria warrants tilray trading at 4x google’s revenue multiple and 2x tesla’s multiple when they don’t even have positive cash flows no ebitda don’t let yourselves get caught up in the hype brother monkeys tlry puts to the moon listen up y’all i know we hate contrarians here but hopefully some of you monkeys can put on your thinking hats for a second and gather ‘round remember true diamond hands don’t care if the stock goes up or down they observe the facts and make sound decisions based on them to amplify their own profits now let’s learn some basic corporate finance together we need to talk about tlry as you all know tlry spiked today…and the day before…etc…up to almost $70 per share some of you made money on calls and i’m proud of you but this pump is going to end and i’m here to explain why obviously everyone is going to point to the obvious to counter my short term bear view the merger with aphria i’m not going to waste your time telling you why this merger might not even happen no instead i’m going to humor you and assume it does in my simple analysis i’m going to use only numbers directly from tlry’s merger announcement presentation which you scrubs can find herehttpsirtilraycomstaticfiles42b99b9b5574499db266aabd0393103e let’s start with two basic facts tlry current share count 1583 million apha current share count 3167 million now the merger proposal says essentially this the two companies will become one company – nothing will happen to tlrys stock it will roll over into the new company but aphria’s stock will be converted into tlry shares at a ratio of 0891 this ratio is our first new term of the day the conversion ratio we can multiply the aphria share number by this ratio to get the number of shares it converts into pursuant to the merger the resultant number is about 282 million shares now we add this to the number of tlry shares that roll over and we have a total outstanding shares postmerger of 440 million this number is called the proforma shares outstanding now we take the proforma shares outstanding and multiply that by the share price everyone is saying this whole pump is shareprice merger arbitrage anyways to get the proforma market cap a whopping $31 billion us dollars now we need to take a second and look at this number the market cap is essentially a proxy for what the market thinks the company’s equity is worth after removing all of its debt the fact that this is what the market is saying the proforma company is worth is absolutely ridiculous given it doesn’t even make money but anyways carrying on with the valuation…we add the merged company’s debt to the market cap to get enterprise value im not worrying about cash for you hardos out there just trying to illustrate a point here – and we get an enterprise value of 31ish billion dollars this is essentially the value of the company as indicated by the market now we can start looking at multiples you may be asking yourself young monkey “why do multiples matter” well they essentially give us a way to value stocks relative to one another this type of valuation simply enough is known as relative valuation and is used every day by the top investment banks and hedge funds in the world one useful multiple in salesdriven businesses like this especially those with no positive cash flows is the enterprise value to revenues multiple generally companies trade in a range that the market considers fair google is trading about 7x for example tesla is at 20 something we can calculate this ratio for the merged company in question using the combined revenue figure provided in the merger documents and it comes out to…46x let me say that again 46x that’s saying this weed company that makes virtually no money on a net basis should be trading at higher multiples than even tesla one of the most historically high multiple stocks out there this is so so so overvalued a classic pump ampx200b httpspreviewreddit3lt39l3girg61pngwidth726ampformatpngampautowebpampse77602544f803e5ac58b150f3d60dd71f7bd6ea3 just for shits and gigs i did this same analysis just looking at tlry as a standalone company in the event there is no merger and at current prices the evltm revenue multiple is even higher at 60x 60 i just want to make sure you all don’t get shafted here you should not be paying this much for a company with no earnings notes these numbers are conservative im not even accounting for further dilution from insider options and convertible securities because you apes probably cant handle it and don’t tell me “it’s about the potential” potential isn’t realized through a press release and you know it furthermore legalization takes a long time to implement and these guys aren’t even us focused seriously – read their securities filings also keep in mind this merger was announced in december and nothing materially altering profitability has been announced since then why the

starting with the very basic stuff ill even avoid deeper analytics since i know you all would just breeze past em anyway recent earnings call amp guidance 2421 historically q4 is a down q for dgx because people arent running to the doctors and undergoing procedures during the holiday season granted i schedule all of my appointments during this time to avoid the inlaws but apparently im in the

repurchases for 2021 more importantly the csuite flat out stated they planned on being aggressive in repurchasing during the year after pulling back in 2020 during the call 1 in 2020 dgx only repurchased $325m httpsychartscomcompaniesdgxstockbuybackhttpsychartscomcompaniesdgxstockbuyback 2 as previously mentioned they are sitting on a boatload of cashespecially after more government ar converts 3 their ceo is a dinosaur he will be using almost all of this two billion authorization increased dividend by 10 great continued improvements in serology area note this company is notoriously conservative in their projections sandbagging pricks the one amp only concern the reason this stock constantly runs up into earnings and then ticks lower despite large beats is solely due to their base testing lagging behind typical performance due to covid the market is acting as if the covid faucet will just get shut off in the snap of a finger soon and then the base testing will take time to return does this sound right to you this line of thinking is laughably absurd and naïve reasons after a year of this shit there is a massive backlog of peopleprocedures that will be completed after more of the pop is vaccinated we havent even seen a dgx q performance with strong base testing and covid $$$ yet q1 of 2021 will be the first book it covid testing rampant testing isnt going anywhere anytime soon as of jan 26th all international flights require a covid test to return obviously dgx lh etc are facilitating much of this work then rumors swirled this week that negative tests could potentially become required to fly even domestically millions of students remain out of schoolreminder the current vaccines are mostly for age 16 so expect strict testing for students too during 2021 mandated by the crybaby teacher unions sport leagues as well as im sure not everyone will get the vaccine political climate stimulus im sure you all saw the cdc is now recommending double masking hell ive passed out four times writing this diatribe due to the 6 masks im wearing why does this matter for every bit a person feels the previous admin downplayed covid the new admin is going 100 the opposite direction considering the us is going to continue to pump trillions into the economy you can bet your ass all testing companies will benefit there will definitely be huge grantssubsidies for enhanced serology procedures and researchand of course in analyzing covid further these testing companies have so much covid data that will continue to be poured over as the pandemic lessens you can also bet there will be an increased $ focus on scanningchecking for new viruses in the near future $$$$$$$ do you think dgx is just going to light the enormous $$$ theyve made over the past 9 months and will continue to make for 2021 on fire because thats what the current stock pricegrowth reflects when in reality and in addition to the buybacks they will be targeting acquisitions in 2nd half 2021 and investing heavily in serology capabilitiesanalysis very quick chart breakdown most of you prob dont chart a ton but doesnt take dfv to see the long sustained consolidation this is begging to jump upwards and it will by next earnings even better outside of an overall market pullback there arent any potential catalysts for a downward swing worthless analyst commentary most recently citi

lohyug,none,n/a,interplay of relationships between goldman sachs robinhood melvin gee em ee and dtcc,dd,7,0.82,baturu,157,tldr goldman sachs morgan stanley and jp morgan are melvins main prime brokers all three firms privately own and sit on the board of the dtcc if naked shorting occurred in gme theres good reason to believe the three named prime brokers and the dtcc may have shut down 128 for nefarious reasons beyond the sudden and potentially arbitrary collateral requirements stated if you’ve read my last posthttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentslma1evillegaltacticsanddtccprimebrokercomplicity i hypothesize that if naked shorting is present in gme prime brokers and the dtcc which is privately owned by the prime brokers would need to be complicit in it which adds another dimension to whether the retail shutdown 128 to stop the squeeze was done for nefarious reasons on the question of whether dtcc was right to shut down trading on 128 based on collateral requirements im not an expert on this subject but ive seen many compelling arguments against it including how did they arrive at the 3 billion number for robinhood and why were they able to get negotiated from 3 billion to 700 million per following dtccs special requirements and why was cash customers restricted vs just margin and why was selling allowed but not buying why not shut off both another interest point is that the dtcc has often been implicated and accused of enabling naked short selling over the years and that the dtcc is privately owned by prime brokersbanks one question posed to me by a reporter was “who are the prime brokers involved” so i decided to do some digging and found this disclosure form httpsreportsadviserinfosecgovreportsadv173228pdf173228pdfhttpsreportsadviserinfosecgovreportsadv173228pdf173228pdf which shows that goldman sachs morgan stanley and jp morgan are melvin capital’s three largest prime brokers based on assets held under custodianship as a reminder if these prime brokers did allow naked shorting and the short squeeze had occurred pushing prices to thousands per share the hedge funds would likely not be able to pay that and prime brokers would be left holding the bag to cover which would also suggest they would be disincentivized to margin call all three firms own and sit on the board of dtcc httpswwwdtcccomaboutleadershipboardhttpswwwdtcccomaboutleadershipboard note that national financial services fidelity is also a prime broker they use but only 6 million in assets under custodianship as compared to a 116 billion each for goldman sach and morgan stanley and 265 million for jp morgan at the time of the disclosure snapshot 032020 i found this to be an interesting data point and wanted to share with the board note the same goldman sachs that has been repeatedly implicated in naked shorting cases source httpswwwsecgovnewspressrelease20169htmlhttpswwwsecgovnewspressrelease20169html and given nothing but slap on the wrists for enforcement also the same goldman that accidentally leaked it’s own emails while defending a naked shorting lawsuit that implicated itself and other banks in participating in naked shorting including quotes like “we are not borrowing negatives i have made that clear from the beginning why would we want to borrow them we want to fail them and “stock is trading at negative rebate with nonpaying customers” naked short in one email goldman sachs tells a client “we will let you fail” ftid trade a stock without locating it and an email from a goldman sachs hedge fund client who remarked that when wanting to “short an impossible name and fully expecting not to receive it” he would then be “shocked to learn that goldman’s representative could get it for us” source

another interesting datapoint is that goldman was chosen as the firm to take robinhood

so alongside with the robinhood citadel relationship as it relates to selling order flow and rh making making 40 of their total revenue from it there’s also a relationship between robinhood and goldman sachs who they would do well to have on their good side ahead of the ipo the thesis of whether there were more nefarious reasons to the 128 shut down which short squeeze was set to occur and when interactive brokers ceo projected price would’ve been in the thousands httpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentslmagzptodayinteractivebrokersceoadmitsthatwithouthttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentslmagzptodayinteractivebrokersceoadmitsthatwithout is tied to whether or not naked shorting occurred in gme because if it did then the prime brokers involved and dtcc would likely have been complicit they would likely be holding the bag if a short squeeze did occur as well as blow back for allowing naked shorting as long documented by counterfeitingstockcom “the short hedge funds the prime brokers and the depository trust clearing corp dtcc—make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small american investor continues unabated… the counterfeiting of shares is done by participating prime brokers or the dtc which is owned by the prime brokers a number of lawsuits that involve naked shorting have named about ten of the prime brokers as defendants including goldman sachs bear stearns citigroup merrill lynch ubs morgan stanley and others the dtcc has also been named in a number of lawsuits that allege stock counterfeiting… abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers with help from their friends at the dtc and major clearinghouses potential target companies are identified analyzed and prioritized the attack is planned to its most minute detail the plan consists of taking a large short position then crushing the stock price and if possible putting the company into bankruptcy source httpcounterfeitingstockcomcs20counterfeitingstockhtmlhttpcounterfeitingstockcomcs20counterfeitingstockhtml a former economist who worked in operations at the dtcc susanne trimbath even came out in this insightful articlehttpswwwthekomisarscoopcom202003howphantomsharesonwallstreetthreatenuscompaniesandinvestors and blew the whistle on naked shorting being allowed to happen within the dtcc i highly recommend you read the full article just to highlight one part of it timbath says “the securities and exchange act of 1933 specifically gave the clearing house the right to require that shares and securities be delivered for settlement it allows them to punish those who don‘t deliver by refusing to have them in the system… the dtcc has for years ignored that” source httpswwwthekomisarscoopcom202003howphantomsharesonwallstreetthreatenuscompaniesandinvestorshttpswwwthekomisarscoopcom202003howphantomsharesonwallstreetthreatenuscompaniesandinvestors in laying out the case of whether naked shorting exists in gamestop the nature of naked shorting means its not easy to prove and there have been hundreds of lawsuits for naked shorting that are often settled out of court because of that but if you’re an investor in the trade you’ve probably noticed that in the past three weeks gme has had a lot of strange things happen to the stock including seeing a precipitous drop in price starting 21 and onwards while short interest supposedly dropped these things all make sense if you consider naked shorting occurred in the case of gamestop there are several very strong signsindicators that naked shorting has occurred i will list some of the indicators that naked shorting occurred in gamestop below 1 one indicator is gmes extremely high number of fail to delivers wwwwherearethesharescomhttpwwwwherearethesharescom which are one of the top in the stock market over a sustained period of time the website wwwwherearethesharescomhttpwwwwherearethesharescom shows extraordinarily high ftids extending from 2020 to years back michael burry tweeted that in may 2020 when he lent out his gme it took weeks for his brokers to locate the shares httpswebarchiveorgweb20210130030954httpstwittercommichaeljburrylangenhttpswebarchiveorgweb20210130030954httpstwittercommichaeljburrylangen ftids can happen for a number of reasons but to have this high number of ftids over a sustained period of time is highly unusual and a stock with a high number of ftids is one potential indicator that counterfeit shares are in circulation and naked shorting occured 2 short interest in gme has been extremely high at numbers significantly over 100 of float as of january 15th short interest was 226 httpsimgurcomfn4fvqlhttpsimgurcomfn4fvql of the entire float while it is theoretically possible for short interest to be over 100 with brokers repeatedly leading to each other short interest this high at 226 of the total float is highly unusual and an indicator of naked shorting occured which is a far more feasible scenario because naked shorting enables short interest to rise quickly as you do not need to determine the shares exist before you short 3 institutions alone have held a staggering 177 of float as of 131 according to bloomberg terminal httpsiredditc44cmb67mtf61pnghttpsiredditc44cmb67mtf61png which is highly unusual and could be a strong sign that gme is rampant with counterfeit shares another interesting datapoint is fidelitys calculation of retail ownership is only 01 float httpsimgurcomaftsoicwhttpsimgurcomaftsoicw which is highly unusual and unlikely to be true any potential indications that counterfeit shares are in play because number of shares to ownership potentially cannot be conclusively determined on monday 21 there was a momentous price drop and that drop continued through the week given the continued high short interest and retail interest to force shorts into a short squeeze the price drop made little sense especially because short interest remained high and even if shorts had covered there shouldve been an upward price pressure what makes the most sense to me is that the price drop was facilitated by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares in a short down ladder described below short a will sell a counterfeit share at $10 short b will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position short b will then offer a short counterfeit share at $9 short a will hit that offer or short b will come down and hit short as $9 bid short a buys the share for $9 covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit by repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral if there happens to be significant long buying then the shorts draw from their reserve of “strategic failstodeliver” and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand source httpcounterfeitingstockcomcounterfeitingstockhtmlhttpcounterfeitingstockcomcounterfeitingstockhtml in an ordinary scenario with short interest dropping and shorts needing to buy back to cover the price is anticipated to go up as of 21 with gmes reported short interest declining with price also dropping there are signs pointing to shorts artificially covering or lowering their short interest via the generation of synthetic longs using options to cover which is in regulation of regsho and again this assertion is supported by the high numbers of ftids gme has consistently reported,2021-02-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lohyug/interplay_of_relationships_between_goldman_sachs/

lojn4x,a,4.02%,a bug in schwab caused my retirement account to go naked short gme,discussion,10,0.69,fragsworth,133,this is a story that involves gme but it is not about gme the events im describing here happened on january 28 in my cash retirement account in short i had some gme shares and used the interface to sell them immediately after i read that robinhood announced the disabling of their buy button a few minutes later it did not appear to work so i attempted to sell again subsequently my account showed that both sells went through then my account had the cash from both sales and a negative balance of shares that i was required to deliver in 3 days after seeing the stock price dramatically rise and my apparent liabilities increasing without limit i freaked out and covered the short position at a huge loss $180k if i was lucky and the price went down i could have been able to cover the short at a huge gain and could have kept my mouth shut not that i would have but instead im out a bunch of money in my retirement account that was a result of this bug and schwab owes me about $180k had i not covered this erroneous short position the shorts probably would have become what we know to be failures to deliver i have attached the record of what happened below which i sent to schwab soon after the event to try to get the situation undone i eventually was able to call their support team and they said i would have to wait 30 days to resolve the situation the guy on the phone said they were having lots of problems with this bug in other equities too i cant recall the complete conversation anyway i recently got a message in the system that i would have to wait another 30 days so i flipped my shit and now im posting about it here please dont comment about how retarded i am for investing my retirement in gme thats not the story i do what i want i like the stock and there is a serious problem here completely unrelated to how retarded i am and the general public absolutely needs to know what is going on i have no information about how many naked short positions were created other than it was more than just myself and in other equities as well i have no information about whether or not the bug still exists i did not test it it may very well be the case that the bug is still a problem as far as i know related i recently posted something that made me suspicious to rstocks httpswwwredditcomrstockscommentslnveroistronglysuspectthatschwabameritradedoesnothttpswwwredditcomrstockscommentslnveroistronglysuspectthatschwabameritradedoesnot i didnt realize this until today but i connected the dots between the details of this post and what happened to me in my schwab retirement account ie schwabtd are the same company and these two things could be related here is the message i sent to schwab for a record of what happened you might notice that its a 401k which most people might note does not usually allow individual stock trading but it is a selfmanaged fund and individual stocks are actually allowed start of message to whom it may concern my name is my account number is i attempted to call your 1800 number several times but i was unable to get through to your support here is a breakdown of what happened there is a bug in your system that caused my nonmargin account to briefly become short gme shares my account is a nonmargin 401k account in good faith i spent $430k to cover the position that my account should not have been allowed to get into two trades need to be undone at market open my position this morning was nnnn shares of gme at 1109 i attempted to place a market order to sell nnnn shares order aaaaaaaa the order did not show up for about 10 minutes my account balance still showed nnnn shares so i attempted to make a similar order again i placed a sell of limit or better to sell nnnn shares at $125 order bbbbbbbb about 10 minutes later i got confirmations for both orders and a notice that the account was due securities i do not have a margin account and it should not have gone short the system should have rejected one of the orders because the shares were not in my account once i realized what the system did i saw the short position which your system erroneously put me in and to protect from the potential infinite uncovered losses on my account i did a market buy at 1144am for nnnn shares using the buy to cover button which zeroed out my position in gme order cccccccc the erroneous trade needs to be undone and my buy to cover also needs to be undone as both of these are not legal trades for my 401k orders bbbbbbbb and cccccccc should not exist on my account bbbbbbbb is a result of a bug in your trading system and cccccccc was a good faith attempt for me to prevent the issue from becoming a much bigger problem im sending this in a timely manner so there is a record of what happened and i will refer to it when i call again when your call volume is reduced end of message disclosure my current positions in my 401k are as follows ignoring what schwab owes me gme 4500 shares cash amp money market $180k again please dont comment about the intelligence or stupidity of my investing

lpe4us,gme,273.20%,theory on recent gme options activity,discussion,15,0.86,fi_disciple,127,i am not a financial advisor i am definitely not your financial advisor i can barely be considered a functional adult if you base your actions off of anything other than your own research you’re an idiot so i wanted to chat about gme option activity and open some discussion around it someone else might have already opened a thread but if so i missed it been working all week and this weekend im so fucking tired there has been chatter about a high volume of weird $1 and $050 puts but i hadn’t really considered it important however i started to see what seems to be a pattern theory someone is using put options to engineer a reverse gamma squeeze my theory is based on option open interest information from yahoo finance when looking at the main upcoming expiration dates 319 416 716 all quantities listed are approximate in total from $0 $50 strike there are 700k put options representing 70m shares from $0 $100 there are only 714k call options of the 700k put options 471k of them are at or under a $10 strike in fact over 215k are at or under a $1 strike the rest are spread out pretty evenly across the range from $50 strike and down i have to ask myself what type of smooth brained idiot maybe someone here would think they could make money off of a $050 or a $1 strike put after thinking and looking at the other activity i started to wonder what if the plan is not to make money on those puts but utilize them to help drive the price down and make money off other puts lets assume the average $05$1 put was $0015 in premium the 215k options would have cost $3225k with only $3225k 215m shares are represented and i’m assuming the mm would need to sell shares short to hedge right the rest of the put activity looks spread out and seems to encourage a fairly consistent downward pressure on the stock when combining the three expiration dates put options are 23k$50 27k$40 23k$30 21k$25 45k$20 24k$15 75k$10 396k from $9$05 especially with the current relatively low daily volume any drop in price influences the mm to hedge which further reduces the price which causes further hedging feedback loop with 70m shares represented and low trading volume i would think the influence would not be small if the theory is true im not sure what to do to make money off it besides standing by with cash to buy as the price drops thoughts position 800 shares $50 dca sold some ccs with $60 strike showerthought rwallstreetbets would be a great place to recruit marines it is well known that crayons are a major portion of a marine’s diet a high proportion of marines wives have boyfriends what is a marine if not smooth brained much lt3 to my marine brothers and sisters d,2021-02-22,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpe4us/theory_on_recent_gme_options_activity/

lq9ldw,gme,311.17%,key upcoming market considerations gme bonds powell stimulus,discussion,78,0.88,sebastianpatel,61,1 we have been going through a minor correction the last few days due to rapid rising of bond yields and so there will be a lot of focus on powells hearing tomorrow and thursday my feeling is that powell will continue to be consistent in his message that his priority is to boost the economymarket and that inflation is not a concern at this moment and that there is no consideration of rising interest rates if this does happen i think we will go right back into heavy green the rest of the month there are a lot of ppl smarter than me on wsb so id love to hear contrary opinions or agreements or whatever you all think 2 do not expect hedge funds in any shape or form to get punished or held accountable by any government agency it is all a show we cannot count on any government incompetent and corrupt officials to do anything to make things fair if you need proof just go back and look at the bernie maddoff story the one greek financial analyst reported fraud ten times to the sec for like 8 years in a row in some ways he was kind of like the dfv before dfv another legend but a different situation regardless the sec did nothing each time maddoff was a hedge fund guy operating a huge 20b ponzi scheme and still the sec did nothing the only reason he was even actually caught was when the credit crunch caused the ponzi scheme to fall apart and maddoff turned himself in the sec is a bunch of pansies when it comes to going after the rich they are owned by the rich they only come after the smaller poorer people the other hedge funds new it was fraud too but the only reason they didnt complain was out of fear that their own fraud would be exposed by brining in regulators the vast majority of hedge funds are all bs and a house of cards there is no government agencies that will do shit against them ever we apesautistsretards are all we have and we must continue to do the work and fight we must beat them at their own game with better data and better research this is just a discussion board but its up to each of us individually to make the best decisions that make sense for each of your respective situations but pay attention to what those hedge funds do what public info they release what they are shorting etc beat them at their own game and bang their wives as you are doing it that is the goal 3 despite point 2 there is plenty of hope and i am optimistic about gme remember these hedge funds also shorted tesla all year long as admitted by hedge fund douche gabe last week surely they tried manipulation there too in order to artificially keep the price down but tesla was and is too strong they could not keep it down forever and then they eventually had to pay the price which initiated a whole bunch of short squeezes as tesla mooned to crazy highs im not saying gme is guaranteed to follow that path but with some good news from rc and with some solid strategic steps gme can break out it just needs some catalysts and then some momentum patience is key here for those who truly believe in gme as i do earnings is coming up in march and some good news could go a long way in sparking another gamma squeeze i will point out that even though melvin shorted tesla last year they still had a very solid year and made a lot of money i believe i read it was around $500m for 2020 so they will still find other ways to manipulate other things to cover themselves whether its using their media puppets their short reporting buddies like shitron short ladders etf underhanded shorting or whatever else they have a lot of shady dirty tools in their bag regardless when it comes to gme we can still win this battle if we believe in gme this is not financial advice and people should only be all in if they believe in gme and can afford to be in it 4 the stimulus looms large congress has estimated a stimulus delivered around march some say it is already priced in but i dont agree i think the combination of the stimulus combined with market reopening has the potential to really take this market to record new highs this however will not last for the whole year imho because inflation concerns will certainly creep up again once we get to the highs if my predictions come true and we do get record highs it will be time to consider the sell in may and go away philosophy i will admit this is prediction is just an estimated guess and i again invite those who are much smarter than me to weigh in on whether they agree with this prediction or things its completely off base 5 mining stocks like mara and riot are interesting and i am watching them ever since telsa announced its investment there has been wild speculation that apple could follow perhaps it is better to just buy the coin instead of the mining companies that i do not know i will say that i think it is absolutely a strong possibility that one day these coins will replace the us dollar as the global reserve currency maybe i am just retarded in thinking that but i think its possible that is all i got i again invite all those who are far smarter than me to rip apart any of these points or to agree with me or to just comment their expertise and most importantly of all by far i will end with one thingi like this

earnings im for sure disappointed but i still see the long term value in it quick things im looking for today powells speech quick thoughts companies that sell luxury goods that hold their value are hot right now people are scared of inflation and of the stock market this is old news at this point so theyre looking for other investments even if it doesnt go up in value it just needs to beat inflation anything that can make them get rid of their dollars theyre not too happy with gold for some reason i explain this in the next section theyre trying their hands with beatc01n but that can be a bit risky and too new for some people old people mostly so how about alternative investments watches wine pens whiskeys sneakers even pokémon cards anything for the love of god take my god damn money oh and when i say people im mostly talking about rich people or anybody with enough disposable income to worry about this stuff it happens a lot in the us and in europe but a place where it might happen much more than usual is china you see china has this terrible habit of devaluying their own currency this helps with exports and with reducing unemployment but lately they couldnt keep up with the us usa number one with the trillions poured into the economy so right now chinas yuan is pretty valuable in comparison with the dollar but this will not stay that way or at least the chinese government will do everyting in their power to not let that happen it needs a good economy low unemployment and overall satisfaction of their population or else their power are in danger and the devaluation of their currency is one of the sure very easy ways of doing so so if i was chinese im not im a martian hiding behind a rock because ive seen an alien coming out of its spaceship but if i was chinese i would buy a lot of watches or anything americans do i say if i was chinese but again its really if i had a lot of disposable income and want to diversify my assets to hedge against inflation and currency risks and chinese people are just a more extreme case of this so yeah anyway nice story to say that companies that sell luxury goods that hold their value are hot right now because people want to put their money somewhere really anywhere chinese people want to buy us luxury goods to hedge against the devaluation of their currency rich people want to buy stuff that hold their value without the risk of the stock market a lot of rich people made money during the pandemic and dont know where to put it a lot of people are bored and shopping for anything cool luxury goods being one of those things might want to short gold gold has been for decades the best hedge against inflation and stock market risks thats because its decorrelated from any currency dollar euro yen or the swedish krona if thats what youre into because theres a fixed supply of it by gold mining companies and because a lot of it is stored safely in central banks reserves the price of gold is not too volatile either so its the perfect hedge to diversify a bit any metal are viewed as an hedge but gold became the standard for it thats because a lot of currencies were using the gold standard not only that drove central banks to store a lot of gold and keep it even after they switched to the monetary system we know now money printer brrr and all that but that safety feeling that gold had back then stayed in the minds of a lot of people what kept that feeling alive even further was that its a tangible asset that had a real world use not just a piece of paper that holds value just because some big entity said so so all that to say gold is a good hedge against the market and inflation except right now investors dont want to touch it that much even when the risks are as high as ever so why well lets explore those reasons a bit before that i want to give a few disclaimers first not financial advice but also this is mostly speculations while we can have a good idea as to why the market behaves the way it does gold is mostly driven by the sentiment of a lot of very different investors with very different perspective strategies and personal risk tolerance the stock market and other commodities are like that too but fundamentals play a much bigger role for them gold on the other hand is mostly a speculative asset so thats for the warnings now lets see what those reasons are first gold went up a lot at the beginning of 2020 from $1500 in march to $2000 in august thats a nice 33 increase in an insane bull market people were eager to put their money in any asset mostly the stock market but gold was nice too but in august gold became overvalued and signs started to appear that this bullish sentiment was not sustainable add to that the fact that the armageddon that investors feared in march didnt actually happen investors wisely switched from gold to stonks and other assets but stonks are not the only asset that was down a lot during march oil too there was a mix of geopolitics and people staying at home so didnt need gas anyway when all that fear calmed down investors bought a lot of oil at those very cheap prices and oil became the commodity of choice for hedging purposes another asset was chosen beatc01n you know what i mean while it didnt have as much impact on gold as oil and stonks it still probably hurt it a little so you might say thats a nice writup buddy youre explaining the past here but you said we should short gold now so what gives well first thanks i put a lot of effort into those posts and its nice that its appreciated but also all of those reasons still apply today and theres more the rising bond yields make tbund much more attractive than gold much lower risk with a pretty nice roi and if institutions want bigger yields they are probably ok with buying high yield bonds since the fed and governement seem to do everything they can to keep businesses afloat also a lot of institutions invest in beatc01n making it a more attractive and legitimate investment that drives the price higher therefore making it more attractive and so on so if theres no catalyst that shifts this bearish sentiment this slow downtrend is set to continue the biggest catalyst that i can see for gold is that america and the rest of the world theres not just america reopens but if it does then that means the economy will be much better and investors will buy stonks even more instead of gold another small catalyst is that beatc01n becomes very risky again institutions will sell and write off those losses elon musk already said he would do that with his tesla investment they will probably buy gold again as a result so in my opinion the bear thesis boils down to stocks oil beatc01n and bonds and other assets being attractive while gold is being forgotten a bit and that might not change for a while while the bull thesis is that a catalyst might change that sentiment ok

lqmfa9,arry,-32.37%,array technologies inc nasd arry a solar pureplay,dd,40,0.88,smallstreetgains,19,company description array technologieshttpsibbcoc6nyvhy went public in october 2020 raising more than $1 billion at a valuation of $28 billion 1 the company manufactures tracking systems for utilityscale solar energy projects 2 array technologies has completed more than 900 of these projects in the past 30 years 3 array mainly operates in the united states generating 87 of their 2019 revenue in the country more than 30 of us utilityscale solar generation uses an array product its second largest market is australia at 8 of revenue 4 the company has installed its systems in 30 countries total 3 its headquarters are in albuquerque new mexico 4 products array’s primary product is the duratrack hz v3 tracking systemhttpsibbcovlcczpt the duratrack platform works with the company’s smartrack software to automatically adjust solar modules in response to unique site terrain and weather conditions smartrack is machine learning based allowing significant adaptability 4 note that array’s combined duratracksmartrack systems is currently its only product offering there are three main factors that influence demand for solar tracking systems 1 levelized cost of energy lcoe companies have no incentive to purchase tracking systems when the cost of the tracking system outweighs the value of the additional energy generation this means tracking systems are only viable in areas with high electricity costs expanding the areas of viability requires decreasing the cost of the tracking system array technologies accomplishes this in a few ways less than 1 motor is in use per mw 5 a single tracker block maneuvers 32 rows with 100 modules 5 uses few moving parts and the design is quite simple 5 smartrack requires no additional sensors or hardware 6 the above design choices allow array to provide trackers that generate the highest amount of energy possible without major tracking costs it is important to note that the most effective solar tracker on an energy basis is often not the most effective on a cost basis array seems to effectively balance between efficiency and product cost in fact the duratrack system is independently verified to achieve 67 lower lcoe than competitors 4 2 operation and maintenance oampm it is important that solar modules utilizing tracking systems have high uptimes so the cost of the tracking system is further recouped additionally repair costs for tracking systems can make their purchase unappealing array’s duratrack boasts a 99996 uptime thanks to its few moving parts 7 the duratrack system requires no scheduled maintenance 5 array provides several case studies proving the product’s durability including its operation in the highcorrosion environment of jordan 8 duratrack’s durable design also includes a fully mechanical windload mitigation system it is the only solar tracker to use such an automatic system without using sensors or electricity 4 3 installation labor and costs array technologies lowered installation cost through 3 singlebolt module clamp designs notably the company claims its rapidclamp design requires just 11 seconds per installation fast installation times greatly reduce the total cost of installing the duratrack system 7 leadership and ownership ron corio picturedhttpsibbcoc2sf7fg is the founder of array technologies and currently serves on the board after being ceo from 1989 to 2018 4 corio is considered a pioneer of solar tracking as he is among the first to develop such a system 20 corio holds 10 of the companys shares and is the second largest shareholder 10 mr james m fusaro is the ceo of array technologies serving in the role since corio’s mid2018 retirement 4 previously mr fusaro served as president of advanced materials at honeywell international inc nyse hon in this role fusaro oversaw the $3 billion honeywell performance materials amp technology business he has also held executive roles at avnet nasd avt and amkor technologies nasd amkr these positions all contribute to fusaro’s lengthy experience in electronics semiconductors and manufacturing he also has over a decade experience as an engineer 9 fusaro purchased 182772 shares of arry in october 2020 at $22 per share for a total cost of $4020984 11 in total fusaro owns around 1 of the company 10 institutions hold 78 of array technologies the largest holder is fidelity investments at 15 of shares other holders include alliancebernstein blackrock the bank of new york mellon and neuberger berman group at over 1 each 12 array’s stock fell in december 2020 after oaktree capital management sold a significant portion of its position in the company the selling of these shares is understandable as oaktree owned a significant percentage of array through its subsidiary ati intermediate holdings 13 outlook and strategy the outlook for the solar industry is very promising solar is the fastest growing form of electricity generation in the united states analysts project the solar industry to grow earnings 32 annually over the next five years 17 estimations indicate us installations of groundmounted solar generation capacity will reach a compound annual growth rate cagr of 16 array sees several tailwinds for the industry regulation of fossil fuels decreasing solar energy costs growing support for clean energy initiatives and accelerating deployment of utilityscale batteries 4 specific to array’s market us installations of trackers for 1 megawatt systems are growing at a cagr of 35 array’s products are now present on more than 1 in 4 solar modules installed in the us to date 5 over 50 of utilityscale solar projects use tracking systems in the united states 14 array technologies is positioning itself to achieve more of this market share array technologies is executing a three part growth strategy gain market share in the company’s core us business array’s order book increased by 31 yearoveryear from q3 2019 to q3 2020 15 expand internationally in the last nine months of 2020 the company increased its international footprint by over 50 15 perform bolton acquisitions as of their q3 2020 earnings call array is currently pursuing several acquisition targets 15 array’s existing revenues have protection through the company’s patents on its duratrack system and components the company’s linkedrow rotating gear drive system also has patent protection until 2030 the patent protects their singleaxis tracking system that uses just one electric motor to drive the rotation of multiple rows of solar modules using articulated driveline joints the patent also protects duratrack’s windmitigation stowing system the company believes its patents force competitors to use less efficient designs maintaining array’s competitive advantage 4 competitors nextracker inc is array’s main competitor and also the largest solar tracking company in the world nextracker is a subsidiary of flex ltd nasd flex after its acquisition in 2014 flex’s stock rose significantly after array’s ipo indicating nextracker being further priced into flex’s valuation flex does not report individual financial data for nextracker in its filings this makes it difficult to perform a fundamental comparison between the two however analyzing the difference in their products provides valuable insight nextracker’s solar trackers use one motor per row of solar panels compared with duratrack’s one motor for several rows nextracker’s use of more motors leads to increased cost and is one reason for array’s superior lcoe although nextracker’s systems are more advanced technically nextracker is unable to switch to a singlemotor system because of array’s patents iarray technologies is currently in litigation concerning an exemployee who allegedly shared trade secrets with nextracker in violation of a noncompete agreement 4 competitively array’s only real moat is its patents which expire in 2030 the company does have certain product advantages over nextracker because of duratrack’s lower cost simplicity lcoe and wind mitigation system array’s patents on these systems will eventually expire it

they are not ready to win bookstores are full of good books on dieting but the world is full of overweight people psychologically they are not ready to be skinny you may base your trades on fundamental or technical analysis you may trade because of hunches about economic and political trends use inside information or simply hope this does not matter only the aftermath when you closed out a trade did you feel elated or humiliated the feelings of thousands of traders merge into huge psychological tidesmemories sentiment that move the markets and sets resistancethe top price and supportthe bottom price the majority of losers spend most of their time looking for good trades once they enter they lose control and squirm from pain or grin from pleasure they miss the essential element of winning the management of their emotions their inability to manage themselves leads to poor money management of their accounts if you’re not in gear with the markets or if you ignore that your mind is not in gear with the markets or if you ignore changes in mass psychology of crowds then you have no chance of making money live with your eyes open to be a good traderrecognize real

reports of a tidal wave of fraudulent charges across different banks and payment networks 2 lets get to the bottom of this and buy the puts that will send us to valhalla currently there is no mainstream reporting of these fraud charges i have puts on bbva fis and fisv again check all of your debit cards and credit cards for unauthorized transactions some of the more common ones are coloadtest angela singleton spotify sumup wfxb and amzncom report the transactions as fraudulent so that your card gets locked instead of simply disputing the charge tidal wave of fraud charges in the links below you will find pages of people reporting small and large fraudulent transactions ive read 300 comments of affected people many of them note that customer service has told them that a lot of other people are disputing similar fraud charges moreover these charges are bizarre in their diversity of payment networks banks and workarounds that they use eg some fraudulent charges are on prepaid gift cards some fraudulent charges are on cards that were cancelled resent and fraudulently charged while still in the mail some fraudulent charges posted to cards that were closed possibly by manipulating a recurring charge mechanism below are links to some of the data points i broke the links because my previous submissions were autospammed sorry there is also a table below where i

uwisehope3654httpswwwredditcomuwisehope3654 made this spreadsheet for the reddit data points megadotnzfilebggqxarkhaadas8e1jtmmkufpzxwm6rghn7fr3id27ec4nrypg ampx200b to summarize the table almost all major credit card issuing banks and almost all major credit card payment networks have been hit mastercard has been maybe less affected some cards have only been used once one card was never used some cards were gift cards some cards were cancelled and then charged when a new card was sent but before it was received in the mail one of the most interesting leads is the commenter who said this data is being shared on the dark web and he got that from a source called idx i have no idea what that is inferences 1 this was probably not an attack on a retailers database because many cards were only used once 2 this was probably not an attack on issuing banks since so many were affected one possible exception is bbva since their cards were the victims of the earliest attacks and have been attacked in relatively large quantity 3 likewise amex and visa are more sus than other payment networks but still not high on the list of suspects 4 some agent that many banks and payment networks use is the most likely culprit this could be a software vendor it could be a faulty pipeline to a credit report company transunion equifax experian that is adding payment info 5 this breach is deep in the system if they are able to hit cards that are ostensibly locked and that are being sent in the mail after the first is cancelled 6 likewise this is probably not a stale breach from long ago since the fraudsters are able to update their card info to these newly mailed cards 7 many are reporting the same fraudulent charges eg coloadtest angela singleton cfxb and sumup so we know these are part of the same breach or set of breaches by the same hacker 8 the sumup charges are being sent to brazil thats a good place for international financial crimes since brazil does not extradite citizens suspicions i think the most likely source of the quantity and variety of breached cards is a deep attack on a acquirer processor an acquirer is the bank that handles the transaction for the merchant merchant acquirers are the banks that handle transaction risk acquirer processors actually process the transactions some banks do both for example chase jpm some banks do not for example wells fargo wfc hands off the processing to fiserv fisv a processor is the most likely to be able to generate the kind of data needed for this attack they would see data from across many banks and payment networks they would have the ability to collect new card data after reissues and data from cards that were never used in the 2011 hack of fis the hackers were able to get into prepaid debit card vanilla gift card data that hack led to a sustained 35 downturn in the fis stock price i suspect a similar breach will do the same krebsonsecuritydotcom201306fdic2011fisbreachworsethanreported i collected data below from people who only ever used their card at a very small number of retailers to get a sense of which acquirer processor is most likely to have been hacked the data is unfortunately not very conclusive httpspreviewreddit65ya90kc2aj61pngwidth2281ampformatpngampautowebpamps51aadd82f159f196b5ccc483901f4878abcec3b3 theres also a possibility that there were multiple breaches and these attacks are being mixed to obscure the origin im hoping some of you know more about the innards of the payment network system or legacy software that banks use to support it im hoping that we can put together a case for a most likely suspect company and make a killing with our early dd ampx200b positions i have a small quantity of otm puts in bbva fis and fisv im not ready to yolo the account until i have more confidence the right targets are selected edit 1 a be sure to check out the comments below on a potential bin attack b i got in contact with angela of the

lqutlp,amd,-9.12%,$amd stealing from market makers amd swing trade thesis,dd,322,0.95,fluxrevived,276,$amd stealing from market makers amd swing trade thesis introduction what’s poppin’ fellas ape gang professor flux here with another heater post you may know me from my atampt dd post which taught you how to follow unusual options flow to make some coin or from my hut 8 dd post which taught you how to make money using financial arbitrage ampnbsp today we’re going to be learning how to identify optimal entry and exit prices for our trades by analyzing simple charts and spotting trends this will be done using the chart for my favourite ticker amd to all you illiterate painthuffing apes who dropped outta highschool and don’t like learning i’ve attached a tldr at the end of the post which tells you which contracts to buy to get some free money let’s get to it ampnbsp building the foundation to begin let’s take a look at the amd one day charthttpswwwtradingviewcomxx5hkiw6s and see if we notice anything odd or unusual do you see anything in particular does anything jump out at you no what about nowhttpswwwtradingviewcomx1dzmpafe still nothing if you still dont notice anything that’s fine these patterns can be difficult to spot initially what about nowhttpswwwtradingviewcomxuhy32hcb as you can see from the final chart for the past year amd has traded within very tight specific ranges i have highlighted these areas on the chart using the pink boxes as we can tell ampnbsp box 1 starting from mid february to mid april amd traded within a 10$ range between $39 and $49 it started at 49$ went down to 39$ back up to 49$ down to 40$ before once again going back up to 49$ where it then smashed through the top of our current trading range creating a new range box 2 now starting from mid april going all the way until earnings in august amd traded within a 10$ range again between $49 and $59 this range was extremely tight and pronounced bouncing from the bottom of the channel up to the top of the channel seven times throughout its lifetime before smashing through the top of the channel again box 3 august through december $74 to 87$ channel this range was slightly messier but still pronounced nonetheless 6 clean bounces smash through the top into our new range box 4 this is where our most recent range lies with an $85 bottom and a 95$ top we haven’t surged out of this range in either direction so it is safe to assume we are still trading within this range how can we use this information to our advantage ampnbsp applying our knowledge to summarize our findings from above for the past year amd has consistently traded within a predefined range before surging higher and entering a newer higher range these ranges have held and contained 27 different bounces without breaking only one single trade has bounced lower than a given range but it recovered within hours twenty seven times this thesis has held true so why the fuck would it be different on the 28th ampnbsp at this point i assume most of you glue sniffers know how we can use this information to our advantage we know that amd trades within a tight range we know that we are currently within the $85$95 range we coincidentally also happen to be sitting right at 85$ as a result we know that it is extremely likely that a bounce off of $85 is going to take place ampnbsp since we know that $85 is likely a bottom and a bounce is likely going to take place we can enter a monthly position here and make some awesome money personally i picked up some 0319 90cs as well as some 0416 95cs and just like that we managed to catch the literal bottom of a trade and have the opportunity to make some free money we can also use our findings to know when to exit our trade ampnbsp extending our knowledge since we know we are trading in a channel we also know roughly when we can expect to exit our trades we know that the closer we get to $95 the more likely it is that we will bounce so we can plan accordingly personally with my 90c i will look to set a stop loss when amd is trading around 90$ and manually sell out of the position if amd manages to break $92$93 ampnbsp even though i’m a perma bull i also trade the flipside of the channel as well if i see amd trading at $95 i’ll enter a short position and play the trade on the way down in this case i set my stops a little tighter and keep a greater watch over the trade since we all know that stocks always go up furthermore since every single channel ended with a blow off top i don’t want to get caught in a random blowout and have my options expire worthless i would rather be conscientious beforehand and manage my risks accordingly ampnbsp conclusion as you can tell we can learn a lot about the price movement of a stock by simply looking at its chart although the amd example was painfully simple it’s also painfully effective the best part about all this is that there are dozens of opportunities like this within the market simply waiting to be discovered i hope you all learned something new today and had fun while doing so if you guys want to check out my other dds or follow me on my socials they can all be found on my profile discord saw this dd first i love you all and wish lots tendies upon each and every one of you ampnbsp tldr buy $amd 20210319 c $90 and $amd 20210416 c $95 ampnbsp 223 update amd held $8450 on this brutal red day and stayed within the channel wow shocker i am extremely confident this is the bottom feel free to scale your positions in and get some

lr1l80,pltr,-6.37%,$pltr extensive dd part 2 what makes it disruptivevaluation,dd,401,0.91,theeliteshitposter,244,yesterday i posted a lengthy dd on palantir technologies $pltr where i went indepth on my evaluation of the firms history its financials and why i believe the naysayers are wrong link included herehttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentslq8rw4ithinkpltrisinvinciblernandinthelongrunhttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentslq8rw4ithinkpltrisinvinciblernandinthelongrun i do recommend reading this first this post is meant to be a followupsupplement to my liking of this stock but i wanted to go more indepth into just why i find this company so special and unique as i mentioned in my dd last night i am just a 19yearold college student not an investment banker or hotshot market maker but i believe the information i have ascertained about palantir by just scouring the web distinguishes it from any company on the planet but well keep it strictly to the software industry in this dd what is truly unique about palantirs software gotham foundry apollo is how collaborative scalable and advanced it is let me break this down palantirs software is collaborative bc it meshes the companys clients data into a mega cloud for example the lapd bp jp morgan and top law firms all upload their data onto palantirs cloud where they can get insights into efficiency efficacy and receive suggestions from the advanced software on how to improve their venture these guys are all pltr clients btw and particularly useful for say defending an embassy or managing a supply chain now just to get it straight there is no datacloud that can come anywhere close to the insights and knowledge on what palantir has you might often hear from wall street research analystscnbc shills who complain that pltr has too many rich clients big companiesgovt but i think what boomers dont understand is that building your foundation amongst the biggest fish in the sea is quite the advantage not a weakness let me use an example from our beloved cathie wood and her firm ark invests large position in tesla extremely quickly i promise when asked about how she felt about teslas performance in the autonomous driving space compared to competitors like waymo owned by google she commented last year that having a vast collection of data would separate those who succeed from those who attempt as a reference tesla cars all transmit selfdriving data back to the firm which comes about through the many tesla owners who drive all over the world on the other hand waymo is committed to private testing stages only which is shallowminded bc it doesnt have access to trial data on say congested roads back to pltr the reason i bring up the waymoteslaark example is to highlight just how many clients pltrs revenue base represents and how impactful that is on a companys growth scalability and ultimately the success of their product but i mean when you think about it palantirs clientele is the entire global economysociety go to the financial times and try to find me an article that doesnt talk up palantirs greatness in the uk and their work helping nih eu members like greecefrance also use it for covid vaccine tracking palantir has contracts with the japanesesouth korean governments palantir has notably helped the us catch infamous cucks like osama bin laden to bernie madoff quite the diversity the reason for that entire bj to palantir right there is to illustrate just how extensive this scale is not only is all this data accessible right now to all these clients to collaborate on palantirs platform but is comprised of the single most dominant and sustainable institutionsenterprises in the world no matter how the political winds blow or how the globaldomestic economy winds up you can count on 3m the dod ferrari to name a few to continue seeking ways to scale grow expand and palantir certainly is the way this gets back to another central bulletproof thesis surrounding palantir who are its competitors who can do what palantir does lets start with snowflake all credit to their talented team warren buffett and their gang of bulge bracket banks who underwrote their ipo and cheerlead the stock on media outlets on the daily but for lack of a better word their software just isnt dope enough i mean the ui contrast speaks for itself but the intelligence is what matters here yes data warehousing is no joke and is certainly a scalable business but what kind of innovative insights can you draw from just essentially a digital warehouse that doesnt add any value all snowflake really is is salesforce dressed up in pretty bells and whistles really makes me question buffetts whole commitment to value c3aihttpsc3ai at least has me interested it seems like a real knockoff version of palantir based on what i can ascertain from their public materials but so what a bunch of washedup junkies from oracle think they can lead the transition to ai compared to a company that was seeded in 2003 specifically to work with the cia and other intelligence agencies after 911 pltr also called the gold standard by these agencies according to techcrunch why waste your time in c3aihttpsc3ai or snowflake dont even get make me started on splunk ibm who conceded they suck by signing on w pltr last week or msft and while were at it lets talk about valuations to drive the point home according to the financial times pltr is valued at a $48b market cap and is trading at 34x 2021 estimated sales to start yes that is very lofty even after accounting for the recent selloff due to earningslockup fears but ill pick on my prime targets snow and ai if we can even call them competitors well be nice snow has just under an $80b market cap but is trading at 80x 2021 estimated sales ai is trading at a $15b market cap and is trading at 705x 2020 estimated sales thats fucking crazy and buffett should sell snow immediately if he cares about value or he just doesnt understand technology since the whole speculation is going to be about earnings in the next few years lets talk about that as i mentioned in my dd yesterday pltr reported eps of $006share on a nongaap basis which is triple what the street predicted but thanks to a $100m stockholder compensation expense the gaap basis was a loss of $002share and wall st took the opportunity to ambush pltr if you understand how business development works these incentives are necessary in the early stages of a company how else do you expect to attract top talent to the company and incentivize existing brains to stay but as you grow into your valuations like pltr will why do you need to do it pltr has essentially promised 30 growth for 5 years and earnings are on the way this year thanks to their earnings report who does apple need to incentivize to stay wall st is simply trying to make something out of nothing i also mentioned pltr was a directlisting yesterday unlike any of these other names here if you dont know what that means basically pltr didnt have its ipo underwritten by banks or pay them massive fees in the process so equity research investment banking asset management and other areas of lucrative finance have no incentive to talk up pltr just jeffries it seems for now and this is what i mean again as i mentioned yesterday it happens with all megacap tech companies think about it as evolution facebook apple tesla google microsoft these guys werent oversubscribed by the money makers either nor were they cheaply valued either but by the time the robust top line translated into earnings these firms were worth hundreds of billions of $ with the snap of your fingers which is exactly what will happen with palantir we are already seeing this their institutional ownership nearly doubled from 12 in january to 21 right now this is what i want you all to think about as a disclosure i am very long pltr you can view my positions on yesterdays dd but irregardless of whether you will invest in it or not read about palantir technologies this is the company of the future able to tailor its cuttingedge technology to all the intricate challenges the 21st century projects climate change further space exploration geopoliticalnuclear tensions renewable energy adoption inequality police reform and so much more while providing a platform for all these parties to collaborate and improve given the world is an ever expanding place and the dominant players are already seated at the table i could not feel more relieved or excited than to have all my chips in the one waiter who will serve them all this is not financial advice i recommend you read up on pltr pour through its financials and hear more from its ceo alex karp and chairman peter thiel then make your own informed balanced intelligent rational decision without a doubt this will be the company being discussed in the decades to come and i just want to expedite the conversation now,2021-02-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr1l80/pltr_extensive_dd_part_2_what_makes_it/

dumbasses who lump rocket in with united wholesale mortgage company and loan depot look how loan depot and uwmc are doing – mortgage companies suck listen you simpletons rocket companies owns the entire housing ecosystem from the front end with their rocket homes business zillow redfin competitor to the origination of the loan via rocket mortgage whether direct to consumer or through their broker channel to their amrock title insurance business which orders the appraisals and title insurance to their nexsys solutions with tools that allow for remote online notarization enabling the mortgage process to be 100 digital and with their servicing business which allows them to think about their clients on a lifetime perspective rather than on just a transactional level as they continue to grow their entire housing ecosystem they are also leveraging their tech platform for other ancillary businesses such as rocket loans and rocket auto link to all of rocket’s companies below httpswwwrocketcompaniescomourcompanieshttpswwwrocketcompaniescomourcompanies let’s talk rocket auto investors mistakenly think that rocket auto hasn’t launched yet it’s true rocket auto hasn’t launched publicly but it doesn’t mean rocket auto hasn’t launched rocket auto currently handles all of vrooms sales marketing and customer service rocket even powers their ecommerce platform they literally run every part of vroom’s business except for the delivery of the vehicle if you look at vroom’s 10q you’ll see that rocket auto inked a 4year agreement with vrm the deal enables rkt to receive up to 8641914 shares of vroom common stock over the fouryear period in addition to a percentage of each car sold on rocket’s ecommerce platform that’s $430m worth of shares let’s not forget that gilbert was a very early investor in vroom 2015 so we don’t even know how much he already owns see section of vroom’s 10q below paragraph in vrm 10q “on may 15 2020 the company entered into an agreement with rocket auto llc and certain of its affiliates collectively “rocket” providing for the launch of an ecommerce platform under the “rocket auto” brand for the marketing and sale of vehicles directly to consumers the “ra agreement” the company will list its used vehicle inventory for sale on the rocket auto platform but all sales of the company’s inventory will be conducted through the company’s platform rocket auto is expected to launch publicly during the first quarter of the year ending december 31 2021 and during the term of the ra agreement rocket has agreed to ensure that not less than a minimum percentage of all used vehicles sold or leased through the platform on a monthly basis will be vroom inventory the company issued rocket 183870 shares of the company’s common stock upon execution of the ra agreement the company will pay rocket a combination of cash and stock for vehicle sales made through the platform rocket may earn up to 8641914 shares of common stock over a fouryear period based upon sales volume of vroom inventory through the rocket auto platform” as you can see above rocket auto is supposed to launch publicly this quarter…and what would be a better time to launch rocket auto than on thursday’s earnings report a public launch of rocket auto coupled with a large financial partnership announcement this we know will happen and maybe even an increase in their buy back can you imagine what would happen jay farner tried to warn the bears this is a stock you don’t want to be short in his warnings was much warranted i do think rocket will acquire vroom – why would they negotiate such a large stock deal why wouldn’t rocket apply their 35 years of selling mortgages to the next most complicated transaction auto sales regardless if they acquire vroom or not it’s clear rocket will be a big player in this arena which will fit their lead generation and sales model perfectly why is used car sales good for rocket because data data data rocket plans to own 25 of the mortgage market and they will probably pull credit on an additional 25 who either may not qualify or may choose to go to another lender rocket also pulls credit on clients who apply for personal loans via rocket loans rocket can very easily have access to half of america’s homeowners credit reports by 2030 – the jackpot of consumer data what does a credit report tell you it tells you if a client has an auto loan or lease and when that lease or loan will be paid off this is extremely vital information that will allow rocket to leverage their ai to cross sell across their platform look at the biggest ecommerce used car sales platform in america carvana their market cap is $50b carvana’s market cap is 30 higher than all of rocket’s 15 companies combined as i stated above rocket’s sales model can easily be applied to car sales if you read rkt dd part ii link above then you know why rocket would absolutely kill it in this arena given their strong culture centered around hard work and customer focus – to the point of obsession meanwhile their ai will analyze the millions of data points collected and will tell them where to focus their marketing who to contact when to follow up executing these tasks may sound insignificant but when you have access to 25 of the world’s credit reports this information will vastly improve their conversion rate rocket is obsessed with improving their conversion rate which is why they invested $500m in tech last year their ai makes 1 million decisions per day and tells their highly ambitious army of sales people where to sell and how to sell in order to increase their conversions not to mention online sales of vehicles accounts for just 42 percent of total car sales we know millennials and gen z have been conditioned to want things delivered to their doorstep – and they hate being sold can you think of a cheesier salesperson than a used car salesman at a dealership ecommerce sales of care is the future this sector that has not properly used technology and there is enough market share for rocket auto to be a dominate player regardless of carvana’s presence rocket homes why buy rkt when you can invest in a fintech company like zillow dear smooth brain please download “rocket homes” on your phone and tell me the difference between rocket homes and zillow i’ll admit rocket homes probably won’t be as big as zillow and is currently only available in 21 states but i guarantee it will grow faster than them because zillow has just zillow whereas rocket owns the entire housing ecosystem and uses it to leverage relationships with realtors insurance agents brokers and lenders all on one platform rocket homes has already been used for the sale and purchase of over 750000 homes i would love to see zillow try and copy rocket’s flagship business the same way rocket copied theirs do you think zillow could originate $250b in loan volume maybe if you gave them a 20year head start i also would like to see zillow try to get into used car sales start and grow one of the largest title insurance businesses in the nation amrock get into personal loans connect brokers lenders realtors and insurance agents on one app which can pull data from each streamlining the mortgage process nexsys hoi rocket tpo and expand internationally lendesk edison financial not going to happen yet zillow is valued at $45b – a whopping 12 percent higher than all of rocket’s 15 companies combined rocket’s expansion internationally rocket continues to show its unmatched ambition this time with its expansion into the canadian mortgage market which is valued at $800b we love our neighbors to the north but damnit is their technology lagging behind ours some of these hockeystick wielding canadian brokers are literally sifting through papercopied rate sheets in some areas of the country rocket noticed this opportunity and launched a platform called lendesk which ties the lender and borrower together in the archaic canadian mortgage and allows brokers to match clients with an ideal loan within seconds their market which is in a desperate need for an overhaul and this rocket’s lendesk fits the bill unfortunately these dumbass mods won’t let me post a youtube video showing lendesks technology in canada to view this video you can refer to this same dd that i posted in rteamrkthttpswwwredditcomrteamrkt link below httpswwwredditcomrteamrktcommentslr2slxrktddpartiiibutrktisjustamortgagecompanyhttpswwwredditcomrteamrktcommentslr2slxrktddpartiiibutrktisjustamortgagecompany this international expansion along with rocket’s other ancillary businesses highlights the initiative rocket is taking to further grow and diversify its businesses and they are just getting started short squeeze originally rkt planned to go public with priced around $22$23 per share with 150mm shares – but due to weak demand they cut the ipo price to $18 and the public float size to only 100m shares despite this smaller than expected float they still have short interest above 30 one of the highest shorted stocks on the market to combat this unnecessary shorting rocket announced a $1b buyback currently their float is $2b first off who even announces a buyback when they’ve only been public for 3 months this is unheard of rocket’s float is currently $2b so this buy back would cut their float in half so if rocket auto a new financial partner and an increased buy back is announced on thursday’s earnings call then how the hell are these shorts 35 of the float going to cover initially the short narrative was that the lockup expiration period would cause a $rkt sell off like we saw with $pltr and $fubo but that didn’t happen gilbert owns over 75 percent of the shares and even he didn’t sell in fact gilbert even bought over $13m of additional stock at ipo in august – that’s how much he believes in this company gilbert has a big ego – so much that he even publicly slammed lebron james after lebron left the cleveland cavs which gilbert owns gilbert also owns fat head the company that sells lifesized wall stickers of professional athletes after lebron left gilbert reduced the price of lebron’s fathead to benedict arnold’s birth year benedict arnold is known as america’s biggest trader see gilbertlebron link below

was petty of dan but it shows he has a big ego that he wants to protect just like lebron these short sellers are messing with his ego and i’m sure he’s salivating at the thought of vengeance on this thursdays call thursday 225 after market close fun fact – even though gilbert did this to lebron and wrote a public letter to season ticket holders slamming james’ departure he was still able to get lebron back on the cavs a few years later and win an nba championship… gilbert is a winner how else do you think he went from a pizza delivery boy to the fifteenth richest man in america see link

but why is rocket stock still falling if they announced a $1b buyback if they truly believe in this company then why aren’t they buying back shares at these these levels answer because they likely can’t buy back shares right now due to sec regulations allow me to explain according to the sec a company is not allowed to buyback shares if it is holding material information that has yet to be made available to the public if a company does do this then they may be charged with a form of insider trading what is material information material information is any information that hasn’t been disclosed publicly and may impact the stock price once released what is rockets nonpublic material information the announcement of rocket’s big new financial partner the public launch and plans of rocket auto this information is likely to be made public on thursday’s earnings call and may send shorts scrambling to cover with whatever little shares remain in the public float and to put fuel on the fire rocket may also simultaneously initiate a buy back that is if there are any shares left for purchase gilbert is the guy who publicly humiliated lebron james for leaving the cavs imagine what he will do shorts who are tainting the image of the company he poured his life into say it with me now rocket bears are fucked tdlr this doesn’t contain even a fraction of the information in this dd part three or dd part one and two but this dude does a good job summarizing rkt’s situation it’s from feb 4 but still relevant

lr4s0t,a,-2.89%,a treatise on the decline of western civilization and dollars why long bonds r fuk,dd,36,0.84,mattseg,118,tldr between inflation historically low rates a potentially overheating market ostensibly a bond bubble i believe long bonds r fuk and how to trade this for fun and profit inflation qe has been going on the better part of the last 12 years another round of stimmys are set to go out soon and there is an assload of money pouring into stocks bonds digital assets metals and other asset classes there is enough money flying around to jack these all up and i categorically think the 2 inflation number derived from cpi etc are total horse shit cpi is a lagging indicator and with half the dollars ever made being in the last like 2 years it’s all looking pretty inflationary when the rubber meets the road and the velocity of money actually starts in the real economy it’s gonna look far worse i also believe that qe is trickle down economics by another name but this isn’t a deadkennedysian punk rock manifesto that said inflation is a pressure on a number of asset classes one of which is bonds and their yields if the gov is selling bonds and the buyer believes the currency is being debased they are gonna want more yield rates rates r low as fuk they have been really low since 2008 and they got lower in the last year though they appear to be edging up yes this is to keep the economy going with cheap money and it’s mmt and japan and ecb did it but there has been a great deal of criticism of it and i don’t believe it’s sustainable and this mixed with inflationary pressure also puts the dollar in a precarious spot where it’s falling out of favor as being a primary international currency of choice at least there are rumors and likely pressures on jpow and yellen about this many people far smarter than i which isn’t saying much think that the market is on a melt up and one way to perhaps contain this fire is to raise rates to get a little money out of the market in a delicate way they have been doing this gingerly and so far successfully as the market hasn’t gone full panic despite what i believe to be a market in the final stages of a melt up due to the cheap money i think jpow et al realize that things are pretty fucking precarious and properly adjusting rates is playing with tnt bond bubble a bunch of smart people are saying there is bond bubble i agree but the point of this section is that i sorta doubt it’s an explosive pop i have yet to find any historical precedent that is well researched of a government bond bubble pop not finding much on the one in the 40’s of us treasuries but it may have happened so basically it exists but it’s not on it’s own seemingly likely to be a case where you wake up and things are fucking flying not like dot com 2008 beanie babies or grey market japanese used panties craze of 2005 then again maybe there aren’t as many speculators on bonds as there were in the other things bonds aren’t sexy maybe the money in bonds isn’t as stupid and doesn’t panic and blow shit up the way the others do the concerns for my thesis timing rates is over my pay grade i’m not a bond trader i never was a bond trader and aside from econ in college and some study materials for the series 7 i know fuck all about bonds in a practical sense if the equity bubble maybe there is one maybe not pops first there may be a flight to safety in gov back securities which causes them to be bid up and thus not plummet if there is sufficient demand the fed may go more ham with qe and buy more long dated stuff and also try to go full on yield curve control folks have said there was a bond bubble since at least 2017 so maybe i’m wrong maybe qe and modern monetary theory are right maybe there isn’t a bubble and rates can stay low forever and i really am as handsome as my mom says profit amp fun so if i’m right and please tell me if i’m not cause i appreciate input from the autists there are different ways to trade this the ways that are resonating with me are tlt puts and tbt tmv calls tbt and tmnt tmv have pretty low internal expense ratios and aren’t meant to degrade the same way more exotic stuff is so i don’t think it’s the same sort of retardation that comes with people looking backwards at a chart of vxx and thinking it’ll go to 2million a share plus with all 3 of these you can do options and as a degenerate gambler that’s appealing to me i’ve been in this trade for about 2 weeks now long dated puts and calls mostly leap calls on tbt at various strike prices under 30 and i have about 60k in it now so it’s pretty yoloesque for a poor like me so far it’s been pretty rad my contracts are up between 5 and 20 and have gone up during the last week of what’s been red for the bulk of my portfolio position is here sorry no charts cause i’m colorblind and i don’t want to field questions about why the uptrend is purple and the down line is burnt sienna and it’s not longer cause my adhd is kicking in and wellbutrin that im on isn’t as effective as adderall i realized i left out something important for those even less familiar with bonds than myself if rates go up value goes down so effectively the bet is to short bonds cause rates are gonna go up ampx200b not that i need footnotes but ive been reading pretty heavily from jeremey grantham michael burry cathie wood jeffrey

lrcllf,none,n/a,self sabotage and the chamber of secrets of why you dont make money,discussion,113,0.83,tonymontanaisnice,131,part 3 this basically explains why losers lose and winners win the moves that some of you make almost feels natural expected by wallstreet its as if they can predict your future moves but what if i told you you there was a solution to all of this stay tuned tomorrow for the sequel my part 4 the prisoner of askforaplan self sabotage trading is a very hard game a trader who wants to be successful in the long run has to be very serious about what he does he cannot afford to be naive or to trade because of some hidden psychological agenda the markets are unforgiving and emotional trading always results in losses freud believed that gambling was universally attractive because it was a substitute for masturbation we fail in our professional personal and business affairs not because of stupidity or incompetence but to fulfill an unconscious wish to fail it hurts to look within yourself for the cause of your failure we sabotage ourselves by acting like impulsive children rather than intelligent adults trading is the most dangerous human endeavor short of war buying at the high point of the day is like swinging your car door open into the traffic when your buy order reaches the floor traders rush to sell to you to rip your door off along with your arm most people go through life making the same mistakes at sixty that they made at twenty others structure their lives to succeed in one area while acting out internal conflicts in another very few people grow out of their problems you need to be aware of your tendency to sabotage yourself stop blaming your losses on bad luck or on others and take responsibility for the results start keeping a diary a record of all your trades with reasons for entering and exiting them look for repetitive patterns of success and failure those who do not learn from the past are condemned to repeat it you need a psychological safety net the way mountain climbers need their survival gear strict money management rules also provide a safety net your feelings have an immediate impact on your account equity you may have a brilliant trading system but if you feel frightened arrogant or upset your account is sure to suffer when you recognize that a gamblers high or fear is clouding your mind stop trading your success or failure as a trader depends on controlling your emotions markets evoke powerful greed for more gains and a great fear of losing what weve got those feelings cloud our perceptions of opportunities and dangers most amateurs feel like geniuses after a winning streak it is exciting to believe that you are so good you can bend your own rules and succeed thats when traders deviate from their rules and go into a selfdestruct mode profits make traders feel powerful and give them an emotional high they try to get high again put on reckless trades and give back their profits they die as traders after hitting rock bottom and wash out of the markets the few survivors realize that the main trouble is not with their methods the trouble is with their thinking they can change and become successful traders you needs to change how you thinks and feels how you relates to yourselves and others successful traders if they take several losses in a row they take that as a signal that something is wrong it is time to stop and rethink their analysismethods losers feel the urge to trade just as alcoholics feel the urge to drink they make impulsive trades go on trading binges and try to trade their way out of a hole like alcoholics washing glasses at a bar soon you will see them sucking dick behind a shell gas station most losers hide their losses from themselves and from everyone else they keep shuffling money keep poor records and throw away brokerage slips a loser is like an alcoholic who does not want to know how many ounces of liquor he drank a loser never knows why he loses if he knew he would have done something about it and become a winner he keeps trading in a fog you have to change how you think in order to stop losing and begin your recovery as a trader losers grow desperate and converts outright positions into spreads doubles up on losing positions reverses and trades in the opposite direction and so on he still loses we spend our lifetimes building up selfesteem most of us have a high opinion of ourselves it hurts a smart and successful person to hit rock bot tom your first impulse may be to hide but remember you are not alone almost every trader has been there brokerage records indicate that 90 out of 100 people trading today will probably be gone from the markets a year from now they will hit rock bottom crumble and leave they will try to

lrfr9n,none,n/a,why inflation hawk expectations are out to lunch,discussion,51,0.88,delavan1185,102,ive been heavily sighing at a lot of posts and news articles lately particularly at people crowing about burry and inflation heres a quick explanation of why they are wrong and why powell is right despite other central bankers worrying right now inflation is one of the most misunderstood things in economics also burry is out to lunch on this one inflation is not a problem and wont be for at least the rest of this year likely longer for starters asset prices and bond yields are only tangentially connected to inflation yields most directly because they tend to reflect expectations which in the current environment with yields rising from essentially zero just means not deflation as opposed to runaway inflation powells comments yesterday were 100 correct on that account the only reason other central banks are a little concerned is that a rebound in us yields will drive up em borrowing costs and a rebound in the global economy will drive up capital flows to nonus markets leading to inflation elsewhere we are a flight to safe haven relatively speaking even further us asset prices have relatively little to do with inflation these days largely because of the relatively open international economy stock prices right now in particular are purely due to there being relatively few places to park money despite a broadly deflationary global economy over the past 1218 months the retail trading spike is part of it too as is international money being parked in the us to hedge against currency risk again because we are the reserve currency and a flight to safety what we are witnessing is a slightly weird but fairly predictable rebalancing major investors are moving out of us tech sectors that are overvalued and heavily weighted in both qqq and spy they are moving into beatendown industrials eg alcoa oil stocks transports consumer discretionary eg restaurants beverages hotels actual casinos and emerging market stocks tldr its fine to expect some inflationary pressures in nonus markets moving forward but us markets are relatively insulated due to how the open economy functions given the us dollar is the reserve currency source i have extensive graduate training in economic policy these are super basic trends,2021-02-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrfr9n/why_inflation_hawk_expectations_are_out_to_lunch/

lrivnu,gm,18.18%,daily dd 1 gm is stupidly undervalued,dd,62,0.82,player89283517,113,welcome to daily dd ill be offering one piece of dd on a stock every day for the next few days on todays episode gm tldr at the bottom why itll  🚀this year and next year 1 biden wants to make the entire us fleet ev by the end of his term you really think hes going to buy $70000 cybertrucks for the fleet can you imagine the outrage if federal cars are using fancy teslas while the average american has to buy regular cars i think biden will be more likely to buy gms newer electric cars once they come out because theyll be much cheaper biden also drives gms cars adding to possible bias or favoritism there i dont think its a coincidence that gm announced going fully electric while biden pushed for a fully electric federal fleet either biden knew gm was going electric or gm knew biden would make this big purchase order 2 cap and trade have you heard of it no you should learn about it or else youll lose out on tendies cap and trade is complicated so im not gonna explain it here go google it point is companies who produce electric cars can receive a rebate because the car emits less co2 compared to a gas car in fact tesla wouldve lost money in 2020 if it wasnt for californias cap and trade program httpswwwcnncom20210131investingteslaprofitabilityindexhtmlhttpswwwcnncom20210131investingteslaprofitabilityindexhtml now that gm has access to this cap and trade market theyll be able to sell these to the remaining gas car companies this will also hurt tesla because the more companies sell credits the cheaper they become also you know whos likely to pass cap and trade the federal government obama tried to pass cap and trade in 2009 httpsenwikipediaorgwikiamericancleanenergyandsecurityacthttpsenwikipediaorgwikiamericancleanenergyandsecurityact but it was never brought to the senate with climate change being a more pressing issue and bidens talk about solving climate change and green energy jobs hes for sure going to try to expand and pass cap and trade on the national level hes also publicly supported cap and trade httpswwwwashingtonpostcomgraphicspoliticspolicy2020climatechangecarbontaxhttpswwwwashingtonpostcomgraphicspoliticspolicy2020climatechangecarbontax from his campaign website and he will demand that congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency that 1 establishes an enforcement mechanism to achieve the 2050 goal including a target no later than the end of his first term in 2025 to ensure we get to the finish line this seems to refer to cap and trade as its the only real enforcement mechanism to achieve a targeted climate change goal with democrats controlling everything cap and trade is likely to pass this time then again politicians lie all the time and biden isnt much different however even if the feds dont step in multiple states have already passed cap and trade with many more to come 3 gms cars are comparable to teslas cars the model 3 isnt actually that good the chevy bolt has a range of 259 miles about 22 miles longer than tesla both cars cost about the same amount the newer chevy bolts also have fast charging so teslas starting to lose its moat here guess elons plan to not patent anything really screwed him over 4 the pe on this is stupidly low come on 1213 its practically begging to be bought at this price compare this to teslas 1230 if gm and tesla both ev companies had the same valuation gm would be worth $5000 this is my price target lmao 5 the uk norway and other countries are planning to ban vehicles norway is the most aggressive at 2025 china is also considering it which would make ev companies like gm go absolutely parabolic gm has the chevy bolt meaning they already have a head start in terms of experience when it comes to producing evs ampx200b ampx200b why is the stock down there are a lot of things that make people scared of gm heres why i think theyre dumb 1 the chip shortage this is a concern for gm in the short run but they were still able to beat earnings compared to 2019 currently theyre projecting the earnings will be $1$2 billion lower next year due to the shortage i think thats a worst case scenario and the market is overreacting to the chip shortage the chip shortage is now getting the concern of congress and biden httpswwwwashingtonpostcomtechnology20210223bidensemiconductorshortagemeetinghttpswwwwashingtonpostcomtechnology20210223bidensemiconductorshortagemeeting given that biden always talks about manufacturing funding the semiconductor shortage via loans or grants and boosting domestic production of semiconductors could serve an easy win he can claim this is coronavirus stimulus money to build manufacturing jobs or whatever gm gets its chips from qualcomm which has a ton of facilities in the us and is based in san diego this can serve as an easy political win for biden 2 charging stations this isnt going to be a concern for much longer most people dont drive for long haul journeys so driving stations arent really needed think about it if you could fill up your car with gas at home would you ever go to a gas station very rarely this is the point of evs and its why i think theyll be the future also i hate to mention biden again but hes planning to put 500000 public charging stations in the us by 2030 this wont be a problem much longer httpswwwbloombergcomnewsarticles20201202joebidenplantofightclimatechangecouldsell25millionelectriccarshttpswwwbloombergcomnewsarticles20201202joebidenplantofightclimatechangecouldsell25millionelectriccars 3 bear market chill this shit happens every couple of months people panic and say the market is crashing its not even if it was gm would hardly be hit because its pe is so stupidly low imo the only company that should tank a ton is tesla people always bring up the buffet indicator because they think buffet is some kind of god hes not sometimes buffet is an idiot he doesnt understand the tech industry and i think the rise in stocks recently is tech related were entering a new era of american capitalism where tech companies dominate 7 stock market growth is the norm with gdp rising 2 per year you should expect to see a high divergence in the long run the buffet indicator only measures gdp too which isnt remotely the same as stock prices stocks get their values from earnings and also the assets the company owns gdp doesnt factor wealth into consideration at all one last point people think its a buy and hold for 10 years but its not i think gm will go to the moon $5000 quicker than you think stocks move faster than reality and price in future expectations there are a lot of catalysts incoming charging stations no new gas cars chip production and cap and trade if any one of these things are announced thats gm to $100 ampx200b tldr buy gm cap and trade ev ban and its undervalued price make it super attractive gm will hit $5000 buy or cry positions gm 12122 $60c i plan to roll

lrusia,none,n/a,dd the war of giants apple soon to open an ad delivery platform,dd,215,0.94,takeachancetoday,193,tldr apple will soon introduce a quality over quantity ad platform that will demolish all existing ad platforms what’s up retards back with a hot take on a nice little company this time apple last time i was here i called snap while it was at $15 adding targeting marketing so at least take some time and try and poke holes in this pipe dream table of contents ios14 apple doesn’t make dumb money decisions facebook plans feature to bypass new restrictions facebook files antitrust lawsuit the small business and ppc community is scared as fuck the last thing apple doesn’t control in their closed ecosystem mobile ads have become a meme and are the last detrimental image found on apple devices the largest market cap on the nyse recent yoy growth at trillion market cap 100 of the market share consistent growth since the ipo of apple with a longterm perspective what’s the upside $750b app store search ads backend platform already exists the war that’s brewing they aren’t afraid of murdering a company regardless the size antitrust httpswwwnbcnewscomtechtechnewsapplevfacebookafteryearstensionlegalbattleloomsn1256008 fundamental explanation of what blocking tracking actually means httpswwwtechrepubliccomarticlesafariforios14andmacos11howtopreventwebsitesfromtrackingyourmovesonline signs that desire for early adoption is high httpswwwmacrumorscomhowtopreventappsfromtrackingyouacrosssitesios apples selfclaimed results httpssearchadsapplecom ios14 is proclaimed to fuck small businesses marketers and ecommerce that is the single biggest zoomer and millennial workforce collective in america with this change businesses can no longer target any iphone user after they’ve visited their website while using the trigger of the ad that they visited the website ie you visit a red shoe page you forget about it tomorrow you see an ad for a red shoe or you look at concerts online in austin then you get distracted and don’t do anything and then you get an ad for a discount to a concert the next time you’re browsing no more ads like that with ios14 that is dangerous because 80 of the digital marketing budget is devoted to remarketing and retargeting efforts across the entire industry so that’s concerning to me because while we can convert customers that have visited the website of our company and that knows who we are we make 97x what we spend on ads but with raw new first time interaction we see a return of 43x this update will essentially fuck all the small businesses that have put in the time to build their marketing structure around facebook and even more so removes the ability for ecommerce to use this as their primary driving factor as ecommerce has an even worse initial introduction return but retargeting they make bank simply put all ads have to be written like you have no idea who exactly you’re talking to beyond a few details of their interests you lose all ability to check if they are interested or even know about your company based off nonfacebook interactions with this facebook interactions aren’t even valid anymore due to their far right audience consuming a 76 majority of their usage you result in clients that are legit fucked so you have to limit your buyer persona a ton and in turn your average ad cost will be raised significantly as it has for the last year as costs have eclipsed an all time high of being 400 higher than last year all in all you’d now spend $15000 for the same thing you would’ve paid $900 for previously unless you’re part of the 00001 of fb advertisers due to the increased costs of facebooks bottom line but also because of all these other factors combining to make it harder to even find the person you want much less be given the time needed to convince them while tracking isn’t the nail in the coffin the further downsides of facebook remove further value this isn’t about facebook though this is to show that apple is making an incredibly multiindustry impacting move with an attempt to bring facebook to a 0 market share of iphone users why the fuck would apple do this they would never hurt their brand they would never make a dumb money decision they are the biggest company on the nyse and that didn’t happen by making off the cuff decisions nor did that happen because of a “privacy play” apple has realistically taken as much of the market as they can while touting privacy as their primary benefit to buy an iphone with this facebook filed an antitrust lawsuit that is literally going to create a war between giants this very well may be the single largest business brawl ever seen the number one most valuable company in america that’s geared to fight the number four most valuable what does that mean well typically apple will stay hushhush since they aren’t making the move for publicity or branding that’s not what happened this time instead as soon as apple was asked for a comment they stated they’d be fighting it following this facebook sends out an email at 300am talking about the impacts this will have on all facebook advertisers they were burning the midnight oil and they decided fear was the best way to motivate the facebook advertisers fuck facebook for that tbh well facebook has a secret solution they can basically bundle an internet browser into facebook and just serve the ads through there suddenly they can track you again because suddenly you are never technically leaving facebook this is sketchy as fuck and is a simple oneline fix for apple to again remove this ability like a game of cat and mouse as apple plugs facebooks bullshit side skirt attempts additionally apple doesn’t historically allow skirts as you can see in the most recent time apple denied a product that competed with a market they are in httpswwwgooglecomampswwwthevergecomplatformamp202061821296180appleheyemailappbasecamprejectionresponsecontroversyantitrustregulation and this move was super controversial want another example maybe a high profile one well apple said fuck epic games and went for the jugular when they straight up removed fortnite and all epic games products from the app store they straight up murdered another billion dollar company and apple didn’t even get scratched literally said “fuck off you can come back when you will pay your bill” apple didn’t care they were going to get their money whether the company or retail investors cared apple is going to get paid when you’re on their platform but currently facebook pays apple $100 a year to list their app that’s it they don’t get a cut of ad share nothing so apple can monetize these small companies making millions but can’t take a cent from the fourth largest company in america that’s not something they’re gonna be chill about especially as facebook continues to damage their own reputation you’ve seen apple swing once with ios14 and you’ll soon see apple swing with punch two but before punch two could even happen facebook files an antitrust lawsuit and tries convincing their advertises with that 3am email to support the lawsuit uh oh must be hot in the walls of facebook so why would apple finally pull the trigger because for years they’ve been building a secret digital marketing ad delivery platform where’s it been tested in the app store and they are currently sitting at a 50 conversion rate on average that means one of two people that see an ad download the app from that ad that is fucking crazy numbers as homeer is currently sitting at 3 that’s a 16x difference that means we could theoretically pay 16x less due to the difference in their ad delivery model or potentially see 16x the amount of impressions what’s the difference that makes apple so different they don’t want to spend your whole budget unless they’ve found the perfect person with apple you can set a maximum budget of $10000 a month currently facebook currently has small ecommerce shops spending multimillions a month in the app store there is a ton of money left on the table currently but that’s not the juicy bit here the juicy bit is that for the last years they’ve been testing and building this platform while also updating all user experience with apple products finally apple has reached 100 control of the apps found and used on their phone but what they don’t control is the ads inside those apps the five obvious big plays here 👉 mobile game ads game ads have become a meme about how bad they are additionally they are essentially the very last item that can give apple a bad look while also largely deceiving the users of iphones you know how bad they are an additional upside to this is that not only does apple look better as a whole but this is before you consider that suddenly small businesses would have access to an even deeper level of targeting imagine now i know my perfect client is 34 has two kids and plays candy crush before she goes to bed well finally i can run ads under that scenario without having to go through some shady venue while also maintaining the trust aspect 👉 ads for kids finally parents can prevent their kids from seeing unregulated ads honestly i can’t give example of revenue benefits here but this does help early adoption and public support a fuck ton 👉 safe for work toggle finally we can have not safe for work ads for those that optin alternatively this would function as sfw only but this is again just another public perception possibility 👉 apple news now apple has been going hard after news apps for the last year why would they do this because they have apple news but it’s not monetized by apple currently again they have third party providers displaying ads that apple gets zero share of but oh don’t worry soon apple will finally monetize all of their software because they have ads running in every platform imaginable 👉 privacy another major benefit is that we can deliver high quality ads as business will get better ads as consumers all while maintaining the fine line of quality and privacy now ignoring all of that apple has seen a moving average growth of 50 yoy for the last four years they have a solid growth path with products and for the last two years they’ve built their cloud platform to not only consume massive amounts of data but also process that data just look at how they can now search through all of your photos instantly and show you them instantly without a single bit of that photo data being physically on your phone they are geared to the fucking tits on software innovation and no one even cares to put it in perspective apple introducing an ad delivery platform with 50 avg conversion rate would be like the day steve jobs announced the first iphone secretly for years they’ve worked towards this moment and they finally swung first in a fight even without ads i fully expect them to hit the target of $165 by the end of the year while reaching $220 safely at the end of 2023 realistically business adoption will take at least 8 months before apple sees enough profit to even recoup the cost of the lawsuit but this would be the single largest business pivot ever seen in the world so if apple goes from a product business to a software business what does that mean for their value let’s look at stripe since we have recent data and we know what they’re doing has the same kind of user lifechanging benefits stripe does $450 million in revenue they were just valued at $115 billion that’s a pe ratio of 255 currently the pe ratio of apple is 34 so not only do i expect them to land in the high middle range of the two i also additionally expect never before seen returns for an ad company not because they have the largest audience but because they can genuinely show your ad to the exact person you want from a business perspective digital marketing is entirely about quality over quantity when it comes to potential consumer eyes and this would be the very first ad platform to operate with this ideal finally apple is currently underperforming and is trading on rumor of a bullshit electric car and is sliding all while literally no one on the internet has considered the idea that they’re doing all this because they’re introducing an ad platform that will soon print billions of profit within months of releasing now finally we can cover the aspect that we don’t have to try and time them developing and releasing this they already tested it got crazy fucking results and no one bats an eye everyone is so consumed by facebook they totally missed the play apple just made there’s a major war brewing and it’s only begun but we’ve all watched the idea that all media is good media be proven true as robinhood received 35 billion in funding during the biggest retail investor controversy in modern day regardless initial interaction apple investors don’t get scared by that apple investors are apple investors because they know they will bring hell to earth before they accept not getting a cut of the money this company is down on the month incredibly and there has never been a better time to buy apple imo while being prepared to hold for about 8 months for potentially a massive massive payout this is not an option we will sell quickly this is a weather the storm and wait for the announcement to set into reality disclaimer that this is pure personal intuition and this idea came from nowhere but my ass and facebook sent the email literally monday so this is as hot off the press it can be all this to say people like targeted marketing both businesses and consumers but not when it’s in facebook hands what company in the entire market is most trusted to do right by the consumer while delivering an incredible cost at likely a higher cost to those paying while also maintaining 100 of their selfmade market apple i am jacked on 31723 190 for 1060 edit due to an awesome fucking user we now know they are hiring a massive amount of jobs for their ad platforms httpsjobsapplecomenussearchsearchclient20partner20manager20search20adsampampsortrelevanceampamplocationunitedstatesusa here’s the snippet ampgt “the ad platforms epm team is looking for a highlyfunctioning selfdriven and versatile leader who can manage a team of epms to drive our site reliability projects these projects are key to our overall operations and business growth you will own delivery responsibilities on projects that seek to build out scalable platforms and reliable infrastructure for core systems and applications across heterogeneous environments this will happen while

ls3ktz,u,-16.88%,unity for the crazy or for the tanks game developer pov $u,discussion,38,0.86,crazytanks,52,so here ill gonna bring my worthless pov on unity but first of all a 1 minute background unity is a game engine which is the most important infrastructure of game making before game engines appeared game developers had to calculate every stupid pixel on the screen by themselves then a lot of wrappers appeared opengl etc and after that the game engines the game engine allows the developer to connect the code graphics music physics and basically everything together most of the large companies develop and use their own game engines but as far as i concern the only public known large and practically adopted by developers are unity and unreal engine well back to that shortly ampx200b lets get back to unity as a game developer also mldl but who cares ive used many frameworks and game engines for more than 15 years hell i even used dark basic when i was young and i can say that unity is the only time i felt at home now i know you dont give a shit about my experience so lets talk business the good stuff unity solves one of the major problems of native growth in game making and thats a fully cross platform engine that means that i can develop once and my stupid stuff would work pc android ios xbox playstation virtual reality web you got the idea that work of being cross platform is insanely hard which means there is a huge leap to create a competing product even the best open source game engines have a very limited amount of devices they support which means that as a developer an open source game engine might be a risk for me in terms of growth and future support tldr 1 cross platform unity got a huge asset store which is a crazy source of revenues from stupid developers like me that means that even if im totally not profitable unity might have some revenue from me without investing a penny or a minute of support team the huge asset store makes it very easy for new developers to do their first steps in the platform and like maya vs 3dsmax or nikon vs canon the first one youve touched is gonna be the only one youll know tldr 2 easy step in huge asset store revenues even from nonprofitable games next the future game industry is growing and we all know it but what unity got that it would outperform the market glad youve asked they got everything unity supports machine learning infrastructures which can be connected easily to many application well thats too general right so let me put it like that 3 years to the future self driving cars are more and more popular and regulated when you regulate it you also have to test it digitally unity is one of 2 game engines that practically gonna be available for that task virtual reality is also a trend guess how most developers develop for it also it might enter the movie industry and stuff like that tldr 3 tons of room to grow vr algorithms and algorithms testing as ive mentioned unity got only one real competitor epic which got unreal engine that does basically the same epic are not public but hopefully will but currently unity is just the only exposure to this kind of product if i had to choose i would just put my happy hippos on both tldr 4 no publicly traded competitors lastly unity can grow without a single phone call there is no major difference for unity to support 1k users or 1m just like google or facebook if we compare it to companies like ttow nintendo and even xboxmicrosoft and oculus facebook they all had to invest ton of money for content creation and physical platform making tldr 5 unity have to spend almost 0$ for each new user ampx200b now for the bad stuff unity price was very high how much high at the pick unity passed ea in terms of market cap thats high its currently at 35 discount right now and it still might considered high but do notice its around 5060 more than ipo day pltr fore example is already multiplied i think they were out on the same day tldr 6 high price whatever that means another bad thing unity had relatively bad quarter their revenue went up but they earnings were still negative why is that well first of all theyve something like 750000 shares which is like 80m$ thats exactly the margin they needed to publish a profitable quarter you know what that means for the next one tldr 7 last quarter was good revenues but bad earnings mostly due to stupid reasons as ive mentioned large companies generally use their own game engines thats a lot of money the currently unity miss lastly epic might go public sooner or later it wont be a surprise if $u would go down some percents at the same day but for the long run etfs would buy both of the stocks like arkarkk did with unity and that would bring the price up tldr 8 their only real competitor might go public sooner or later thats it if you survived everything tell me what you think for me i think ill just buy the dip and hold forever since the growth is crazy and the world just getting more and more digital but please do your math since no one know whats gonna be disclaimers i know nothing about nothing im not an investment advisor and dont take any advice from me or in general dont just listen to a random stupid guy on the internet and all that read about it yourself im just a developer that enjoy and know to appreciate the platform and

recession nightmares so intuitively the plays which would make most sensewithstand all of these are undervalued stocksrare gems in an overvalued market i introduce to you ticker $f ford 🇺🇸 🦅 the all american car manufacturer which withstood every recession since 1920s the company which our government treats as a favorite child the car manufacturer which produced most american cars ever and finally the innovator which employs one of the greatest pr firms and rampd teams i know i know you may say wtf ford gtfoh boomer hear me out till the end and youd be surprised ford is storming the electrical vehicle market and they arent fucking around veni vidi vici yes you read the tittle right not only that but also they are targeting middle class value buyers high quality cheap ev cars to compete with tesla after years of development this year they came out with mache an ev car which has a starting price of $35395after federal tax credit which still applies to ford evs indicates great government connections and easily rivals a model y when it comes to value its way cheaper and has relatively comparable features as the verges sean o’kane perfectly said i dont think people should underestimate just how important the mustang mache could be the mustang branding makes it instantly familiar and the design is striking enough that it gets noticed right away without being so out there that its uncomfortable or weird or alien its the kind of car that in a couple of years if enough of them are on the road it can really make people take notice and think about buying an electric car in a way that the ipace or the audi etron or the chevy bolt never have or will i think ford is tapping into something only tesla really does well right now with the mache which is trying to mix that modern design with increasing ubiquity in a way that could make people feel like theyre missing out on something much like the effect a new iphone can have for more on mach e comparison to tesla cars link 1httpsseekingalphacominstablog23322283rdbarris5534036reviewsoffordmustangmacheshowteslanosecretsauce link 2 what about production constant need for innovative technology in evs and the need for other models productionkeep all of the following in mind because a tesla comparison is ahead ford produces around 556 million cars per year its the second biggest us car manufacturer they know the ins and outs of the car production market and have top tier international connections1 additionally and more importantly they have the government in their pocket ford has active production facilities in turkey china romania spain india canada germany south africa thailand russia taiwan argentina england venezuela mexico brazil and slovakia1arranged by size but im not here here today to talk about that ill be focusing on the ev car production ford has already produced 10000 maches and they delivered 5000 of them to dealers in addition they are planning to produce 50000 maches this year while this number may seem minuscule in comparison to the six figure production number of their gas vehicles its an impressive start in the ev market by comparison this year so far tesla has rolled out and sold just 14100 of its electric suvs the model x and back in 2017 the ev manufacturer was able to produce only 1764 of its popular model 3s in the first six months of production the following year however tesla delivered more than 140000 model 3s while tesla had a slow start it certainly has caught up in filling customer orders in 2019 it’s averaged sales of 12500 model 3s a month or about 150000 cars a year while ford won’t be able to match this years tesla sale numbers initially it looks as if it’s off to a strong start source motor biscuits another point to keep in mind other carmakers haven’t had as an impressive showing as tesla in ev production either jaguar sells a mere 200 ipaces a month the audi etron a plugin suv is averaging about 600 sales a month as for the chevrolet bolt its sales numbered about 13100 to date this year the chevy ev’s first year saw only 23000 producedmotor biscuits and please dont get me started on chinese ev bs bottom line is aside from tesla production numbers in the ev space ford is the next runnerup after tesla what about international production and sales ford to go all electric in europe by 2030 it intends to spend $1 billion to revamp a factory in cologne germany where it will produce evs using a volkswagen platformbiggest car manufacturer in europe this new strategy involves phasing out gasolinepowered vehicles in favor of electric power the automaker expects to have all commercial vehicles made by ford in europe be electric by 2024 two years later it expects to have converted its entire lineup into electric or plugin hybrids gasolinepowered commercial vehicles will still be offered for sale in europe after 2030 ford says however the automaker currently sees electric models accounting for twothirds of its european salessource tech crunch what about asia ford announced jan 27 that its mustang mache suv will be manufactured by changan ford for customers in china the mustang mache will start being produced there later this year as it looks to tap into chinas electric vehicle ev market remember that china is the worlds biggest car market with more than 20m vehicles sold each year bbc what about government support in production ford ceo calls on us government to support ev batteries chargingheadline on feb 24 reuters he outlined the automaker’s plan to develop electric platforms for its topselling trucks vans and suvs what happened after that biden ordered for a review of us supply chains for vital goods such as large capacity batteries and semiconductors in addition he signed an

lshq22,none,n/a,energy squeeze play oil price crash anniversary,dd,23,0.66,charterholder69,83,real dd from jp morgan quant on oil energy equities according to jpmorgan quant kolanovic the biggest short squeeze yet is set to begin next month as systematic funds momentum chasers trend followers and the cta community in general cover their legacy shorts in the energy sector and go long cta funds have been adding energy exposure the reason is that 12month momentum turned positive on oil and going forward signals will remain solidly positive however this is in the context of a huge systematic net short overhang in the energy sector in other words energy in all forms be it oil or energy stocks remains the most hated sector across all investors the catalyst that forces the squeeze is the anniversary of the collapse in oil prices at the start of the covid crisis at which point various vol metrics followed by volcontrol funds will reset and they will have no choice but to go long that and this is the punchline of kolanovics thesis    will change in midmarch when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive which is also a gentle hint from the jpm quant to all the redditors out there if you want to spark a truly historic short squeeze one which forces systematic shorts to not only cover but to go long do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks kolanovic was kind enough to even give you the timing you have about a month to do so because jpms model momentum factor will need to rebalance in march by closing 20 of its allocation to energy equity shorts and adding 2 to energy longs for a 22 net buying in energy what is the quantitative significance of these flows well the croatian quant calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about $1tr in equity longshort quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized the flows could be quite significant roughly $20$30bn it could be far far more as shown in the chart below the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other sampp 500 shares shorted closely followed the commodity supercycle and remarkably the most recent number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the sampp 500 average httpspreviewredditk8tmabq70pj61jpgwidth500ampformatpjpgampautowebpampsaa83fd4081396649eb5e4964124ce9f1c0e2aedf we then said that since volcontrol funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance it now appears that said frontrunning of the cta squeeze officially kicked off yesterday because according to goldman prime on monday feb 22 on the same day the bank saw the largest net selling in us macro products since jan 27 the biggest increase in etf shorts since november offset however by aggressive buying in single names it also observed

lsqshm,amc,59.04%,update on amc,dd,542,0.9,permawritersblock,349,hi everyone one of the many apes from amc stock here and i just wanted to spend a moment to tell you guys my unsolicited opinion about whats going on with amc stocks now the amc stock generally follows the same trend as gme but there are a number of factors that suggest that tomorrow 02262021 could be a fantastic time for others to join in on the stock if they have any interest now why would tomorrow be a good time to go in on amc 1 short interestgt so the hedge funds attacked this stock super heavily today 02252021 with shorts dropping it by just over 20 this has created a problem for the people gambling on amc stock to drop for two reasons the first is that they are left with only 75000 shares left total to play with tomorrow and secondly because they put amc under ssr protection for all of 2262021 which makes it increasingly difficult to continue to short the stock through tomorrow now this is just one apes oppinion but if the hedges arent able to drop this stock down tommorow and all retail investors are buying and holding than i cant see why the stock wont shoot back up tommorow i imagine most of the paper hands retail investors were scared off already by the huge dip we had today 2gamma squeeze potentialgt so by the end of market hours tommorow there are a number of significant options expiring with the heaviest numbers starting at 8 dollars for example if amc ends at over 8 dollars than 61263 options will activate equating to over 6 million shares being traded and gamma squeezing the price up by monday and that isnt even including all the options that activate lt8 at the moment the stock is sitting at about 750 and if my first point about the hedge funds is correct than 8 is a number that should be relatively easy to hit 3 long term valuegt so should the worst situation happen and the stock plummets again tomorrow negating the chance for a gamma squeeze than there is still value in keeping amc as a mid to long term stock we know that when amc diluted their shares they were able to refinance their debt with the money they gathered so bankruptcy for them is off the table through the rest of 2021 that means they have until roughly mid 2022 to start generating profits and we all know that covid vaccinations are already starting to roll out alongside the theatres which are starting to open up ampx200b and i just wanna end this by saying im not a financial advisor just a random ape that has done a little dd and wants to share what i personally believe could be a good opportunity for us all to get those tendies let me know what you guys thinkthanks sources for my info gt fintel yahoo finance tdameritrade ampx200b edit hey guys i really dont wanna spread misinformation so i just wanted to point out that the amc stock being worth 20$ pre covid was wrong looks like it was actually tanking through 2019 ending at around 8 when covid hits treys trades did me dirty on that fact hes always talking about amc price pre covid d still though im sorry apes i do still stand by my other points though for the short term and in future posts i will be more careful in what i post love u guys,2021-02-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsqshm/update_on_amc/

lst66i,none,n/a,“the real moon play” multifaceted infinite squeeze cycle,discussion,841,0.97,low-classroom7736,361,revised i think i get it now it’s not one or the other squeeze it’s all of them together driving each other congress just had them testify about round 1 but they don’t even know round two is gonna bigger they turned the issue into even more discussed worldwide news that may not be the “catalyst” but it is aerosolized fuel in an enclosed space ready for a spark the armageddon only statistically possible but completely unimaginable scenario we’re heading towards we all know the shorts exceed the number of available shares and the original short squeeze thesis but now we have the gamma squeeze taking part retail figured out how to counter synthetic shorts by forcing institutions to honor call options every call option that has been written and is in the money must purchase shares in the open market even though there are not enough shares in existence to do that and not just the shares in the market this would mean the entire share count held by hedges and clearing houses being transferred to retail and etf ownership through options being exercised retail countered the naked shorting in way that not only negates it but exponentially increases the squeeze process it’ll be like using a market order to cover a short squeeze gobbling up any share no matter the costremember the 5k snipe orders last time except at a market wide level the entire float plus forced shares bought for itm contracts how much can something cost when it doesn’t exist but has to be bought the ultimate lesson in supply and demand it’ll be like taking the strength of pliers and adding a hydraulic press we were all looking at it like round one over extended hedgie shorts vs retail holders forcing a cover but the dynamic has evolved to a multi faceted infinite squeeze cycle this is “the moon” play this makes that ai suggestion of 130k a share make sense i’m not saying the ai is right necessarily in terms of price i am saying it’s gonna take a deeper look at what happens when institutions owe more than they can’t deliver and resulting price movement further exacerbates the original step the machine takes information and extrapolates it went to 5k when it was retail using available shares to force shorts to cover how multiplied can it get when that happens again while institutions are forced to buy 100 share lots for contracts there won’t be enough open shares on the market they’ll have to sell their own to the option holders just to honor them they’ll have to buy more from other brokers and clearing houses having the same problem and all of this is compounded even further because the higher this drives the stock the more option contracts are itm more forced buying and giving their own shares more squeezes more contracts itm repeat repeat repeat repeat that’s the important part not just the squeezes the “cycle” because it’s self perpetuating past a certain point like a dying star reaching the critical mass it takes to become a black hole i saw someone even mention that once and i didn’t understand but they were right it would literally crash the stock market and effect all foreign markets involved an upwards crash that sucks all capital from the largest players i see people mentioning “rational thought” or “rational behavior” of the stock but it’s not rational holding something beyond its suggest value breaks with the notion of rational value systems it’s mass irrational behavior to cause extreme hyperbolic stock movement i feel like hyperbolic is the right word over parabolic you know how when you buy a call it technically has the potential for unlimited gain because the stock can theoretically go up infinitely this is exactly that situation being played out on a grand scale i think it’s kind of amazing because this is the defining characteristic of using the the stock market instead of gold it increases the amount of perceived wealth beyond the physical capabilities of the world there’s not enough gold or precious metals to equal the world economy it’s made up to represent something that can’t exist but is necessary to facilitate the notion of unlimited growth and now that very same principle may be inadvertently used to either destroy the system or force an evolution of financial theory the entire point of this idea is that the mechanics are being broken by players refusing to acknowledge parameters they learned to cheat the system back at us the first time shorts are creating shorts of shorts they don’t exist they’re making unlimited shares to maintain their position so buyers are gonna do the same thing but purposely do it in an arena that can’t be expanded indefinitely they can make up the shorts they borrow back and forth with each otherand through unknowing retail stocklending program participants but there are only so many real shares they are inarguably finite by definition could they force a reverse split or force dilution by issuing new shares against shareholders and the company’s will i don’t know all we have to do is hold hold on to your sense of wonder as the story plays out hold to your courage i’m not a financial advisor and don’t know what i’m talking about i just like this stock and stories about the end of the world i don’t even care about the money that much i just want to take control of my own life i can’t wait for us to read about this moment in history someday and each think about what small parts we played and how we remember it apes together

important update to what happened yesterday ampx200b first of all i made a prediction in my post yesterday the prediction wouldve become reality if hedgies didnt overshort with fake shares more about that in a second why do i tell you this i literally received death threats and insults when the market ended just a heads up those are predictions they can be faulty at times especially when hedgies do such unexpected things that no data can predict again more about that in a second so please for the love of god dont harass me insult me or send me death threats when something like that happens i understand your frustration but dont target me ampx200b now the juicy stuff what exactly happened yesterday here is a timeline ampx200b 935 am the market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a huge spike in volume hedgefunds shorted over 18363000 shares over the first 5 minutes the amount of shorting was so aggressive that trading got halted twice within the first minutes

the price down to $126 at that point in time between 5000000 and 7000000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye what stood out for me at that point in time is that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack between $100 and $125 that tells me it was really important to get the price down in that direction more in a few seconds

analysis where did they get so many shares to short gme and why was it not predictable so how could no one forsee this its simple hedgefunds didnt borrow shares to short they created them out of thin air when the market opened yesterday all available $gme shares to borrow were gone already see my second edit from yesterday edit2 10am 0 shorts available for $gme right now they borrowed over 2100000 shares to short for yesterday and today httpsfinteliossusgmehttpsfinteliossusgme httpsiborrowdeskcomreportgmehttpsiborrowdeskcomreportgme what does this mean well no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now because they are not using real shares to short gme they can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially what happens when we add up to shorts and price dips mentioned above now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious if we add up the three big short attacks 18363000 right at opening 5000000 to 7000000 at noon and about 10000000 right before close we get 33363000 shares sold short over the day why is this funny and obvious check the latest finra report it states that yesterday more than 33000000 were sold short thats almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips httpspreviewredditd3vuakyd2tj61pngwidth453ampformatpngampautowebpamps494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb why did they short gme so aggressively with fake shares because bears are fuk see when gme wouldve closed in between $115 and $150 over 44000 call options wouldve become itm if exercised that wouldve driven up the price ahpre or today in the high hundreds maybe even thousands why is that so bad the higher the price gets the more calls get exercised so called options chain the more people jump in because of fomo and we get closer to the magical $800 mark where the moass would become inevitable this or next week httpspreviewreddit3djwn1de2tj61pngwidth700ampformatpngampautowebpamps3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b what can we learn from this looking forward hedgies dont give a single fuck anymore even when all the data available states that there are no more shorts available to borrow for gme we found all of their etfs where they hid their shorts they keep shorting it to try and stop the moass you know what they say there is nothing more dangerous than an animal thats trapped in a corner ands got nothing to lose anymore thats what were seeing right now no one can give accurate predictions anymore that is based on data this has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions they dont care about the long term results of their illegal actions they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days in short be prepared for everything dont be scared of dips they are more than likely created artificially by highly illegal shorting with faked shares ampx200b tldr hedgies are so fucked that they just shorted gme with more than 33000000 nonexistent shares yesterday keeping the price down in order to stop the gamma squeeze from happening the price wouldve jumped up to a few hundred maybe even thousand dollars today if they didnt do it which wouldve started the real squeeze today they have nothing to lose anymore so be prepared for more highly illegal action and dont get scared by fake dips ampx200b edit1pm european time according to this site httpshortvolumescomtgmehttpshortvolumescomtgme the short sale volume was 61 percent yesterday with a short sale volume of 50959384 that doesnt mean that hedgies opened 51 million new short positions i am being really conservative and sticking to the 33000000 if its more than that even better

here is a great read httpcounterfeitingstockcomcounterfeitingstockhtmltextin20the20context20of20thisthe20company2c20is20considered20counterfeithttpcounterfeitingstockcomcounterfeitingstockhtmltextin20the20context20of20thisthe20company2c20is20considered20counterfeit quote naked short — this is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares in the context of this document a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company is considered counterfeit this is not a legal conclusion since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon todays rules the alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud returning to our example everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone elses account there is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the dtc without a borrowed share behind the short sale a naked short is really a counterfeit share ampx200b edit3930am the fee to borrow gme shares went up by 12 over night and is therefore in the double digits for the first time since 4 weeks httpsiborrowdeskcomreportgmehttpsiborrowdeskcomreportgme ampx200b edit4 how do i know that it was hedgies and not retail selling their shares it is possible that some retail traders sold but if you take a look at the short volume 61 yesterday with 51000000 shares being sold short and then take a look at the overall sell volume it doesnt add up if there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 short volume the price drop wouldve been much much bigger most retail held through therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting because no one was selling ampx200b edit5 i am preparing my next dd right now and holy shit yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and i can give a date for the squeeze to take place almost certain but i dont want to make false promises so please take it with a grain of salt because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date if i am able to finish it today ill link it here as well this actually feels like a conspiracy theory because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true ampx200b another edit to blueball you guys even more the crazy lastminute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight again connecting to that specific date but thats just a theory a gamestop theory just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is ampx200b update i have all the data you cant make up

battles if you know yourself but not the enemy for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat if you know neither the enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every battle” p6 tomorrow self psychology trading appears deceptively easy when a beginner wins he feels brilliant and invincible then he takes wild risks and loses everything trading is a fascinating intellectual pursuit chess poker and a crossword rolled all into one a trader keeps odd hours and puts his capital at risk many traders are loners who abandon the certainty of the present and take a leap into the unknown the goal of a good trader is not to make money his goal is to trade well if he trades right money follows successful traders keep honing their skill if you become half a percent smarter each year you’ll be a genius by the time you die focus on trading right and improving your skills so that money no longer influences your emotions the trouble with winning is that many people self destruct soon after accidentprone drivers keep destroying their cars and selfdestructive traders keep destroying their accounts traders who are not at peace with themselves often try to fulfill their contradictory wishes in the market if you do not know where you are going you will wind up somewhere you never want to be a successful trader is a realist he knows his abilities and limitations he sees what is happening in the markets and knows how to react to them analyzes the markets without cutting corners observe your own reactions and make realistic plans once an amateur takes a few hits and gets a few margin calls he becomes fearful instead of cocky losers buy sell or miss trades thanks to their fantastic ideas or fears they act like children who are afraid to look under their bed our fantasies influence our behavior even if we are not consciously aware of them a successful trader must identify his fantasies and get rid of them “i lost because i didnt know trading secrets “those ladder attacks” many losers have a fantasy that successful traders have some secret knowledge this is called the brain myth losers do not know that trading is intellectually fairly simple it is less demanding than taking out an appendix building a bridge or trying a case in court good traders are often shrewd but few of them are intellectual often after the amateur is sold out the market reverses and moves in the direction he expected losers take this reversal as a confirmation of their methods they earn save or borrow enough money to open another small account the story repeats the loser gets wiped out the markets reverse a loser is not undercapitalized his mind is underdeveloped he overtrades and his money management is sloppy he takes risks that are too big whatever the size of his account a trader who wants to survive and prosper must control his losses you do that that by risking only a tiny fraction of your equity on any single trade give yourself several years to learn how to trade do not start with an account bigger than $20000 and do not lose more than 2 percent of your equity on any single trade learn from cheap mistakes in a small account amateurs neither expect to lose nor are in any way prepared for it the notion of being undercapitalized is a copout that helps them avoid two painful truths their lack of trading discipline and their lack of a realistic money management plan most human activities call for an exercise of judgment machines and systems can help but not replace humans just look at accountants airlines pay high salaries to pilots despite having autopilots they do it because humans can handle unforeseen events traders who have the autopilot fantasy try to repeat what they felt as infants their mothers used to fulfill their needs for food warmth and comfort most people give lip service to their wish for freedom and independence but in reality they want to be relieved from the need to think for themselves some gums call important market turns others promote unique methods” new highways to riches still others have escaped criticism and invited cult following through the simple mechanism of departing this world the broad stock market has normally spent 25 or 3 years going up and 1 or 15 years going down a new market cycle gum emerges in almost every major stock market cycle once every 4 years a gums fame tends to last for 2 to 3 years the reigning period of each guru coincides with a major bull market in the united states when you see a hot new guru follow their advice because sheep are following him and you can ride the wave but get out while the sheep still follow everybody wants a dark model or a woman with a birthmark on her face a model does not change public tastes do institutional employees play it safe and never achieve spectacular results because each uses similar methods a guru is surrounded by a mob of admirers if you ever find yourself in such a crowd notice that a guru is seldom asked questions about his theory his admirers are content to drink in the sound of his voice they brag to their friends about having met him a guru remains famous for as long as the market behaves according to his theory usually for less than the duration of one 4year market cycle the market changes and marches to a different tune when you recognize that a successful new gum is emerging it is profitable to jump on his bandwagon it is even more important to recognize when a guru has reached his peak when the media takes notice time to inverse mass psychology being what it is new gums will certainly emerge an old cycle gum never fully comes back once he stumbles the adulation turns to derision and hatred an expensive vase once shattered can never be fully restored losers look for a strong leader they look for a parentlike omniscient provider they walk with their umbilical cords in hand looking for a place to plug them in” as an intelligent trader you must realize that in the long run no guru is going to make

seehttpspreviewredditsyvpt1m4tvj61pngwidth882ampformatpngampautowebpamps2e65377fc7cfcbd212a6ff8ca714ca330fedf02e so a speculation bubble occurred but why what caused it and what does that mean going forward especially with the recent activity yesterday and today firstly i am not a financial advisor and i dont give financial advice secondly to answer is pretty simple this was caused by millions of apes rushing to the stock market to buy gme duh news goes viral about the squeeze the apes buy paper hands sell ok but that sounds really bad right again not necessarily bubbles like this happen all the time on all just about anything that can be traded over time scales ranging from a few hours to a few months one of the things that makes gme such unique opportunity is that there is an incredibly tiny number of available shares relative to its market cap this important for the squeze but it also means the price is more susceptible to dramatic price fluctuations in fact it is this property that make a squeeze possible its the nitrous in your gas that turns it into rocket fuel imagine you and all your neighbors are on a life raft in the middle of the ocean and everyday you get 10 gallons of water to share between you that no big deal but what happens when 10 gallons turns to 9 then 8 then 7 and so on the less water available shares the more volatile you and your neighbors get until eventually everything goes mad max and you have all the water to yourself so the speculation boils down tois this the squeeze did it squouze am i too late so what does that mean for the apes that boarded at 200 250 400 well nothing the price is going to jump around a lot and every time it should settle a little bit higher than before all the while costing the shorts more and more interest until the squeeze goes off or the market value has reached your cost basis and youre wishing you bought more dip so you could have averaged down and made a profit by now additionally if you assume the price jump was in fact speculative bubble it means the shorts couldnt really have covered without guaranteeing rocket launch those arrogant entitled assholes would have had to look in the mirror admit they lost and launch the rocket themselves or they could lie to you and double down historically they double down because its not their personal money and the hate being wrong almost as much as they hate losing money personally i dont think the shorts will ever capitulate on their own i think that it will end in one of 3 ways 1 sec will turn up some smoking gun of some kind in an investigation that cant be swept away and a scapegoat will be offered to the public 2 their clearing house will call their the short positions in and theyll go belly up 3 the shorts are right and were either too dumb or too distracted to out last them just to be clear these are all short term endings the long term end is basically cohen and friends save gamestop and turn it into a digital platform powerhouse or they dont they got a pretty good track record though i mean chewy sells pet food and toys and its valued at nearly 6 times what gamestop is dont get me wrong i love my dogs but i spend way more on video games each year than i do on pet food and supplies and i dont think im the only one ok so that covers jan but what about today and yesterday well yeah short answer is im not sure but my best guess is that as a result of some options trading practices someone had to buy a bunch of shares to hedge those options and because the available supply is being restricted by all you apes the price reacted extra sensitively kicking off even more hype this would be a good sign as it means that the fuel mixture volatility is getting super powered and just waiting for the right ignition catalyst

availability and fees for shorts enjoy this light weekend reading 😉 part 1 finra i put together the finra daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days httpregshofinraorgregshoindexhtmlhttpregshofinraorgregshoindexhtml culturecrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion httpswwwfinraorgfinradatashortsalevolumedailyhttpswwwfinraorgfinradatashortsalevolumedaily note if you want to find this raw data use the link above and you will need to go into each days file updated at 6pm daily and search for gme then copy the raw numbers the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to this is not a userfriendly document there was an additional 22 million in short volume today on top of the 33m yesterday and 12m wednesday while this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio the short volume as of total daily volume as published by finra is at 57 which is the same levels that we saw on jan 2729 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price caveats this data does not include nyse which is why total volume for today is 38m but actual total vol is 90 million thanks to utrifireengineer for bringing this up he has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that once nyse data was included short volume went up from 568 to 576 i think this shows that while the finra data is just a sample its large enough to be considered representative of the full market daily data does not equate to of total shares that are shorted as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered shorting but is not what we would usually define the best data is the monthly finra data but that only comes out once a month and that doesnt sound very fun here are my data tables again all taken from the finra daily data assumptions used gme float stock 54490000 this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45m gme total shares 69750000

decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting gme the data available through iborrowdeskcom httpsiborrowdeskcomreportgmehttpsiborrowdeskcomreportgme for those wondering about the site check out the about page the site uses text files from interactive broker’s ftp site httpsiborrowdeskcomabouthttpsiborrowdeskcomabout note this data does not take into account

httpspreviewredditroplc5ly12k61pngwidth1198ampformatpngampautowebpampsf6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9 here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from 2 million at 11 borrow rate to only 450000 at 9 borrow rate the last time there were less than 500000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5 as seen through this site was on jan 27 when we saw some huge intraday price swings part 3 etfs this data of course doesnt take into account the shorted shares in etfs that have high stakes in gme for example ex ar tee is currently 175 shorted

they have even published an article singling out this etf because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved ie shorted gt“…we have detected an approximate $858 million dollar outflow thats a

shares the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows shrinks this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the etf tldr

i so choose go has just 375 locations in 6 states their most recent 10k was released in 2019 and stated they have a longterm potential of 4800 locations nationwide go is just getting started their longterm growth is projected as 147 as compared to industries 124 in 2019 they plan to expand their number of locations by at least 10 a year this alone gets my dong hard as stated in their 10k their management is not accustomed to operating a publicly owned business this sounds bad but is actually a good thing imo go is already an amazing business model imagine if an ackmanr cohen type character

the other company from taking losses the chain of freshness you may have heard that up to a third of all food produced by americans is thrown away httpswwwgooglecomampsamptheatlanticcomamparticle491513 the chain of freshness describes how this happens and how food moves 1 food is grown 2 food sent to be processed andor packagedbranded 3 it goes to warehousethis sometimes involves many layers of regional and local warehouses 4 it goes to a store 5you buy it anywhere during this chain product can get slowed down it wont be fresh enough to be accepted at the next checkpoint in the chain so it goes into a dumpster although the actual freshness of the product may be fresher than you would ever see at a store its not fresh enough to go to regional then local distributors before landing at the store not only fresh enough to consume but fresh enough to be able to sit on the shelf for however long is required by the stores business plan this would be a good time to state that im technically an industry insider as ive been dumpster diving for years ive seen warehouse dumpsters full to the top with product all packaged and nice fresher than you would ever see at a store you may have heard in the news recently about portland police guarding dumpsters full of food from citizens fred meyer said the food was spoiled but it was just unsellable due to liability issues and food quality laws perfectly edible food httpsapnewscomarticleportlandstormsoregon4eebd2cd2f1b9f798667994bc871a647 this is just the tip of the iceberg as warehouse dumpsters are usually behind fences and guarded with cameras so no one sees that waste except for me i fill my backpack with organic chocolate hipflasks of brandy and have personally recovered enough frozen marinated ribs to grill up and play meat jenga withwhich we actually did this waste is caused by logistics problems which could be alleviated by grocery outlet adding value to everyone involved now imagine this company if food waste laws are passed penalizing companies who waste food with images of cops chasing people away from a dumpster full of perfectly good food in the news the discussion is very likely to surface among other progressive talking points grocery outlet is uniquely positioned to profit from this trend if companies were all of a sudden compelled to reduce their waste it would be a huge growth opportunity just based on their current guidance go is a great bet but in this rapidly changing world a newly public company like go with an innovative business model can change its current guidance multiple times tldr a long standing glitch in the logistics of how we sell and move food around leads to dumpsters full of perfectly good food that makes up about a third of all the food americans produce go has a unique business plan that with the help of a bigdick activist investor hiring of corporate heavy hitters and the possibility of food waste laws could turn those dumpsters full of food into dumpsters full of money for everyone involved heres a link to an article that has the numbers i referenced

ltmxom,none,n/a,is shorting bonds the new infinite money glitch,dd,105,0.81,divysuresh,92,good morning my fellow degenerates hope you all are in good health and spirit tldr shorting bonds could be one hell of a play shorting emerging market foreign junk grade corporate bonds might be the fucking moonshot if im right today i want to talk about the most boomer investment there is fixed income securities or bonds so just some background information bonds are a debt based security meaning that you are loaning a company municipality or government money in exchange for regular interest payments but the underlying issue i see is when any significant inflation happensits when not if more on this later and the fed hikes rates most of the bonds issued now and in the past few years suffer from something called interest rate risk interest rates share an inverse relationship with bonds so when rates rise gt existing bonds fall this makes sense because why would you ever keep money in a bond paying x when the current going rate for bonds is much higher this kind of market pressure can quickly tank bond prices which is why i think shorting certain corporate bonds or etfs who hold corporate bonds is a good idea why inflation is going to spike this topic has been discussed to death here on wsb by the few 🌈🐻who havent yet been hunted to extinction by jpows money printer now im not going to waste your time and explain in detail every reason i believe relatively high inflation is just on the horizon that being said im going to recap the highlights of the core arguments m1money supply has increased drastically through quantitative easing but unlike 08 where they lowered rates through decreasing yields on treasuries theyve also started buying up other debt securities directly decreasing yields across the board they did this to help ease the burden on businesses and allow them to borrow money for much cheaper they also did this because the credit market froze and when the debt market freezes you know shit is about to go down but this time also unlike 08 the fed went full brrrrrr and well ampx200b does injecting this much money into the system seem sustainable to youhttpspreviewredditfqcibc65ezj61pngwidth960ampformatpngampautowebpamps4d0c2609a617f0bab6205f30d1b90c293dac884e ampx200b the graph really speaks for itself so much money has been injected into the economy through the debt markets that bonds yields are practically nothing the reason we havent seen that money actually inflate the economy is because the velocity of money has tanked for the retards in the back who fell asleep in econ 101 the velocity of money is the rate at which money changes hands to purchase a good or service within a given timeframe because economies all across the world are dampened at the moment with all the restrictions and shutdowns the average consumer is spending much less now than they would otherwise be expected to the velocity of money is going to skyrocket as the economies of the world open back uphttpspreviewredditlvzafh5zfzj61pngwidth728ampformatpngampautowebpamps735b0e7796514ed098450521303cb7bfcabf0867 as all this money which was previously locked up in households and businesses reenters the economy well likely see a sharp uptick in inflation now the people who run the federal reserve arent dumb they realize that this sharp rise in inflation is bad the fed doesnt want to see runaway inflation and so theyll do whatever they can to counteract the effects of printing this much money the most effective way of the fed counteracting all this printing is by creating a big negative liquidity shock this is known as quantitative tightening read raising interest rates which is going to absolutely decimate bond prices which is why credit where credit is due as a liquidity shock occurs the market usually does sell off so the 🌈🐻 converting to a cash position isnt actually the worst thing you could do but then again being cash gang means inflation gang is slowly eating your effective capital it also means you hold a position even more fucking boomer read boring as shit than investing in bonds congrats now that we established what interest rate risk is how it effects bonds and why were likely to see a substantial amount of it in the coming months years its time to narrow down the pool of bonds we could short governments across the world are printing money like theres no tomorrow and this is because the growth corrected interest rate is negative its not only negative in europe and japan but also much of the developing world which means governments there are much likelier to take on higher amounts of debt now mathematically speaking this is fine as long as compound growth outpaces or stays in line with compound interest this debt is manageable it becomes less and less of a burden with each subsequent year inflation the problem occurs when that growth is strained or when interest rates get hiked most rates are effectively negative accounting for growthhttpspreviewreddit7c49p6gckzj61pngwidth318ampformatpngampautowebpamps11be27b9e3264f759ebade62098727b026bb1e75 i think the prime target is emerging market foreign junk grade corporate bonds that are denominated in usd the reason i say this is in the event of qt by the fed there will be a liquidity shock creating a spike in demand for us dollars which is what the world relies on for most global trade this makes the dollar gain value in relation to other currencies quite quickly and probably unexpectedly unless the market prices this in which will see these bonds decrease in value anyway making your short position profitable bonds from companies that primarily do business in local currencies but hold debt denominated in dollars face exchange rate risk if the price of their local currency falls in relation to the us dollar they end up paying much more than expected in their local currency to keep up with their payments if this is not an investment grade bond it means rating agencies think the company has heightened default risk so this very well could be the straw that breaks the camels back and bankrupts some of these companies even if they stay solvent i think the increased risk would cause a decent sell off now because im not blind and i see the sentiment on this sub and their views on short selling unlike melvin and co i am not over shorting or illegally naked short selling a company and directly engineering the failure of these assets companies i am merely using the data available to me and making a bet on where bond prices will be in a few years time if i enter this trade and or make money off it i will donate a portion of the winnings to a charity that operates within the emerging markets i shorted why the fuck are you telling me this now if this isnt going to happen for a while because the sooner individual investors recognize the opportunity the sooner individual investors can pick the best targets furthermore all of this is for naught if rate hikes are priced in before individual investors enter their short position this is already priced in no the fuck it isnt why do you think theres usually a market selloff and downward pressure on debt markets directly following rate hike announcements unless the news is ridiculously old most of the time it isnt priced in i watched you retards claim disney was priced in for weeks and i still saw disneys stock spike on rollout day disclaimers disclaimer i am not as familiar with debt markets as i am with derivative and equity markets so i may have missed something obvious theres a reason i post this shit before i actually call my broker to initiate the short position i am also not a certified financial advisor investment in any security poses risk not all positions are suitable for all investors keep your goals needs and risk appetite in mind before you invest disclaimer 2 shorting debt instruments like bonds carries hidden interest payment risk youre liable for paying the interest payments until you close out of your short position bonds are also much less liquid than stocks so finding bonds to close out your position could be difficult shorting is also an unlimited risk strategy so idk maybe buy calls on the bonds to hedge let me know what you think am i the next dr michael mcflurry burry or the most retarded thing this sub has seen since robinhood box spreads i dont want to go full retard so i figured id let you glorious autists critique my position tell me if how im wrong

shares $105 httpsglobalfinancialdatacomeddiegilberttheboywonderofwallstreettexton20june20122c2019582c20theremaining20502520of20bruce20stock gilbert began buying up shares of bruce in february 1958 at 16875 to acquire majority ownership of the company as gilbert bought more and more shares bruce’s stock price rose and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like bruce wasn’t worth the price it was trading at in the process gilbert was acquiring all the float in bruce’s stock as the price of bruce stock rose further the shorts were forced to cover their positions on june 12 1958 the american stock exchange suspended trading in e l bruce stock when the stock soared to $77 a share shares were in short supply because the management of e l bruce owned 50 of the outstanding shares and gilbert had taken control over the remaining 50 of bruce stock the shares that were sold short represented the balance between bruce and gilbert typically in a situation like this the exchange would step in negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position and settle outstanding short contracts for cash but gilbert didn’t want to do this gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned e l bruce corp although the american stock exchange required that all shorts cover their positions the stock no longer traded on the ase and the shorts had to find shares overthecounter this led to a mad scramble among the shorts and the stock reportedly traded as high as $190 as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions short interest in the stock gradually declined from 16134 shares on may 15 to 6440 shares by august 15 and to 3500 shares by september 4 the remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no “fair market” in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established however in aronson v mccormick the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares httpsglobalfinancialdatacomthepigglycrisis saunders vs the shorts clarence saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the new york stock exchange in 1923 the corner became so prominent that the whole affair became known as the piggly crisis clarence saunders was generous determined stubborn and wellknown in memphis saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of wall street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in piggly wiggly stock the goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them when the stock declines in price the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price make a profit and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from in a bear raid several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline the bulls on the other hand can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss if the bulls can buy up the existing float the stock is cornered the shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand of course creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price little demand is left for the stock the price of the stock can collapse leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt the whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls piggly wiggly shares started trading overthecounter in july 1920 and listed on the new york stock exchange nyse in june 1922 in november 1922 several of the independentlyowned piggly wiggly stores in new york new jersey and connecticut failed and went into receivership although saunders’ corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable some wall street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on piggly wiggly stock the bear raiders began selling piggly wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape saunders took this challenge personally he had created piggly wiggly stores created the concept of selfshopping was spreading his stores across the country and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores saunders decided to “beat the wall street professionals at their own game” saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in memphis nashville new orleans chattanooga and st louis to buy up the existing float in the wall street of the 1920s bear raids came and went companies didn’t go bankrupt because of bear raids and if the fundamentals of the company were sound the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over nevertheless saunders refused to give in to the wall street city slickers saunders hired jesse l livermore the most famous bear on wall street to help him break the back of the bear raiders within a week livermore had bought 105000 shares of piggly wiggly over half the float of 200000 shares the bears had shorted piggly wiggly stock in the 40 range but by january saunders’ bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past 60 the shorts were losing money the shorts are cornered piggly shares were traded on both the chicago and new york stock exchanges in january the chicago exchange announced that the stock had been cornered though the nyse denied that a corner existed so saunders decided to try a new tack he announced that he would issue 50000 shares of piggly wiggly shares at $55 each saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors saunders pointed out that piggly wiggly stock paid a $1 per quarter dividend yielding 7 to investors since this occurred before the sec came into existence saunders could promise that this was a “once in a lifetime opportunity” and get away with it since piggly stock was then trading at $70 why would saunders offer shares at $55 leaving $15 on the table for each of the 50000 shares the reason is that saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered the demand for piggly stock would dry up saunders’ stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan put $25 down and pay $10 a month for three months since the new shareholders couldn’t sell their shares until they were paid for this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions on march 19 saunders let it be known that he controlled all but 1128 shares of piggly wiggly’s outstanding shares he had cornered the shorts on tuesday march 20 saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him by the rules of the exchange the shorts were required to produce the shares by 215 on march 21 the stock opened on the march 20 at 75½ moved up to 124 by noon but then dropped to 82 on the rumor that the exchange planned to suspend trading in piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts it was no rumor the nyse did suspend trading in the stock saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on thursday the 22nd by 3 pm at $150 per share thereafter his price would be $250 per share the exchange permanently halted trading in piggly and gave the shorts until 5 pm on monday the 26th to settle with saunders with this ruling the nyse saved the shorts this postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the 1128 outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to saunders was it right for the exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in northern pacific in 1901 or should the exchange have left the shorts to their fate the nyse justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market saunders wins a pyrrhic victory on friday the 23rd saunders offered to settle at $100 per share in the meantime the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in iowa or new mexico to cover their positions shareholders in sioux city who knew nothing of the piggly crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere $100 saunders now had complete control of piggly stock but he was also deeply in debt it is estimated that saunders made halfamillion dollars out of his corner but that proved insufficient to cover his costs after saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds he found that he was five million dollars short half of which was due on september 1 1923 and the balance on january 1 1924 since piggly shares could no longer trade on the nyse saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again offering piggly wiggly shares at $55 although the public was sympathetic toward saunders and his battle against the wall street bears the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if piggly wiggly were ruined it would “shame the whole south” memphis’s newspaper the commercial appeal lined themselves behind saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince memphians to buy piggly wiggly shares and save their local boy the newspaper planned a threeday campaign to sell 50000 shares to memphians at $55 a share this was to be an all or nothing proposition if they were unable to sell all 50000 shares none would be sold the campaign began on may 8 and soon 23698 shares had been subscribed despite this skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign saunders or the public they asked for a spot audit of piggly wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment saunders refused the audit but offered to step down and let a committee run the company skeptics also asked why saunders was still building his milliondollar pink palace when piggly wiggly was possibly in its last throes the pink palace was a huge house built using pink georgia marble the palace was to include a pipe organ roman atrium indoor swimming pool ballroom bowling alley its own golf course and other luxuries saunders promised to board up the pink palace and stop construction unfortunately the campaign was unable to sell even 25000 shares and the campaign soon fizzled saunders responded by selling piggly wiggly stores rather than stock to raise money despite selling stores in chicago denver kansas city and elsewhere saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the september 1 payment of $25 million saunders turned over his piggly wiggly stock the pink palace which was sold to the city of memphis for $150000 and opened as a museum in 1930 today it includes a replica of the first piggly wiggly store a planetarium a natural history museum and a museum of twentiethcentury memphis and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan by spring saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings if saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy pride went before the fall httpswwwamericanheritagecomjacobschiffandnorthernpacificcorner2 in 1901 james j hill who controlled the great northern railroad and was the largest stockholder in the northern pacific used the latter to seize control of the chicago burlington and quincy a smaller road that threatened the union pacific’s territory when hill refused to address harriman’s concerns harriman determined to get control of the burlington by seizing control of the northern pacific morgan was hill’s banker so an attack on hill was a direct attack on morgan before long schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock which had equal voting rights in northern pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority morgan and hill had been caught napping morgan was in europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy 150000 common shares of northern pacific at the opening of the market on monday morning may 6 1901 if hill could get a majority of the common he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control the cost at the very least would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars morgan cabled his immediate approval and the battle was joined between the titans those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves on monday morning harriman and morgan held between them 630000 of the 800000 shares of northern pacific common in existence by the close of the market on tuesday the morgan bank had purchased 124000 shares more that left only 46000 shares un accounted for but the volume of northern pacific for those two days totaled 539000 shares the vast majority of these of course had been sold “short” when too late the short sellers realized what was really happening panic swept the street suddenly the shorts were desperate to close out their positions and willing to pay whatever price was necessary as they liquidated their other assets to buy northern pacific stocks and bonds plunged morgan’s new us steel which had been at 54¾ only a few days earlier skidded from 40 to 26 on thursday morning while northern pacific ratcheted upward minute by minute one broker hired a special train just to bring a single certificate for 500 shares down from albany another incautiously admitting he had 10000 shares to sell was stripped virtually naked on the floor of the exchange itself as the shorts clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price that morning the firm of street and norton sold 300 shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share ten times what the price had been a week earlier by noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the street itself the morgan bank and kuhn loeb called a hasty truce they would buy no more northern pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at $150 a share calm began to return to wall street kuhhn loeb had fought the morgan bank to a standstill this allowed harriman to get what he really wanted which was not control of the northern pacific but attention to his interests from the northern pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary the chicago burlington and quincy railroad harriman was soon on the board the new york times likened the affair to so many “cowboys on a spree shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of the bystanders” it is ironic that morgan and schiff so instrumental in reforming the bad old ways of american business were among the principal antagonists in wall street’s last great railroad war so reminiscent of the wild and woolly days of the civil war era httpswwwftcomcontent0a58b63a42943e078390c3aabef39a26 httpswwwreuterscomarticleusvolkswagenidustre49r3i920081028 frankfurt reuters volkswagen vowgde briefly became the worlds biggest company by market value on tuesday as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by porsche pshgpde short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1005 euros a share during the session following sunday’s news that there was less than 6 percent of vw voting stock still floating in the market at that price volkswagens voting stock was worth 296 billion euros $370 billion or more than the $343 billion market capitalization of exxon mobil xomn vw shares later closed trading on tuesday up 82 percent at 945 euros the share price has rocketed since porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on sunday that it had effectively gained control of 74 percent of volkswagen’s voting shares in march when porsche was still sitting on a longheld 31 percent direct stake it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to 75 percent bearing in mind that the state of lower saxony holds a 20 percent stake in vw “the speculation of going to 75 percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of vw porsche said at the time “in view of the fact that lower saxony as second largest shareholder owns 20 percent of vw the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low” meanwhile on tuesday a spokesman for german market regulator bafin said it was looking into the vw share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation porsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect “we vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation” a spokesman for porsche said “the ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling volkswagen share price” porsche’s statement on sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 426 percent held a further 315 percent in cashsettled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world’s third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year it said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in vw were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets “without haste and without greater risk” around 128 percent of volkswagen’s entire market capitalization was on loan as of october 25 the most recent day for which data was available according to financial market data consultant dataexplorerscom this compared with an average 5 percent for all dax stocks the “mother of all short squeezes” as one analyst phrased it led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by porsche dealers said those traders who had sold borrowed vw shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of porsche’s holding “someone must have been very desperate to get a hold of the stock so there will be a big surprise at some point who will have all these losses because someone must have lost a lot of money” said christian schick head of portfolio management in germany for fortis investments shares in morgan stanley msn goldman sachs group inc gsn and frances societe generale sognpa all tumbled on tuesday with traders saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving volkswagen goldman declined to comment but people inside the company said it had no volkswagen losses while a morgan stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker socgen could not immediately be reached for comment but earlier on tuesday said it was sticking with its thirdquarter earnings forecast volkswagen dax weighting shares in vw were up 45 percent at 6899 euros by 1604 gmt after tripling at one point in the previous session this meant they were trading at around 63 times expected earnings for 2009 at a massive premium to rivals such as toyota motor corp 7203t and daimler daignde analysts and traders said the stampede was historic for german large caps but they could foresee vw shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels “the problem is from a fundamental point of view shares are really overvalued but when the short squeeze comes to an end there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down” said one frankfurtbased analyst despite the massive rise in vw shares and talk of little free float remaining the frankfurt stock exchange said it did not plan any changes in the german bluechip dax index but wolfgang gerke a member of the frankfurt stock exchange’s exchange council told manager magazin’s online portal that vw stock should be reweighted on the german dax bluechip index as soon as possible when asked about the current nearly 17 percent weighting that volkswagen’s stock has on the gauge gerke said “deutsche boerse needs to act now and reduce vw’s weighting on the basis of its considerably lowered freefloat” the finance ministry declined to comment on the rise in the volkswagen share price and the economy ministry did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment httpswwwmarketwatchcomstorysqueezeongoldmanputfalconeinpenaltybox20130821 philip falcone the billionaire hedgefund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement did something many people on wall street wish they could do he put a short squeeze on the vampire squid in 2006 goldman sachs gs 253 as the great cephalopod is officially known was shorting distressed highyield bonds from a bathroomfixtures manufacturer called maax holdings inc goldman one of the most powerful investment banks in the world was also encouraging its customers to do the same poor maax the company was just trying to make shower doors sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean poor falcone his harbinger capital owned a ton of these maax bonds and goldman was flushing them right down the drain it is an awful thing to learn goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it people often respond to such news in crazy ways you might remember a firm called lehman brothers back in 2008 blaming the entire financial crisis on shortsellers — including a shortselling cabal led by goldman lehman fired back by getting the securities and exchange commission to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks as for falcone well he responded in his own way he grew up playing hockey in a dying minnesota mining town not far from the canadian border he made it to the pros in sweden and now owns a piece of the nhl’s minnesota wild in hockey if another player smacks you against the wall you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face in hockey this is called sportsmanship falcone according to his confessional settlement with the sec sought revenge against his opponent falcone bought up every piece of the maax bond offering there was he even bought more than there was according to the sec he purchased 22 million more bonds than had ever been issued because on wall street you can always buy stuff that doesn’t actually exist this move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that goldman was trying to short and it put goldman right up against the wall goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position that’s when falcone said something like “hey squid you want some maax bonds i got your maax bonds right here” and then demanded that goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds now i am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault this call doesn’t happen very often though in an arena where such violations occur all the time the sec came down on falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid forcing not just an $18 million settlement and a fiveyear ban from the industry but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong “today’s charges read like the final exam in a graduateschool course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully” said robert khuzami in 2012 when he was then director of the sec’s enforcement division and announced the charges against falcone i very naively had no idea business schools taught such courses perhaps now that falcone has been banned from his industry he can go back to his alma mater harvard university and teach them “clients and market participants alike were victimized as falcone … manipulated the market for certain bonds … and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales” khuzami added httpsmoxreportscomkbioinfinitysqueeze removed to keep within character limit httpsnypostcom20171101ackmanhasbailedoutofhisshortpositiononherbalife after nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on wall street bill ackman has finally given up his $1 billion short bet against herbalife the embattled hedgefund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a “pyramid scheme” and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if herbalife’s stock falls but ackman also admitted wednesday that the big bold short bet his hedge fund pershing square capital made against herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer herbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company which vehemently denies ackman’s allegations that it practices a predatory business model the rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a “shortsqueeze” in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they’ve sold to make their bearish bets — a move that also drives up the price among those who have bet directly against ackman on herbalife is his nemesis billionaire carl icahn who now owns nearly a quarter of herbalife shares “there is no longer an opportunity to squeeze pershing square” ackman said in a wednesday interview with cnbc instead of shorting herbalife ackman is now shelling out cash for put options which will pay off if herbalife shares drop but which don’t pose the risk of a short squeeze unlike holding shares short where pershing square’s losses could be unlimited ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital — what he called “modest investment” nevertheless “they’re going to charge ackman a premium … for the privilege of him owning a put” ihor dusaniwsky head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm s3 partners told the post ackman’s dealer — who sold the put option — now holds the short position according to dusaniwksy “ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety” dusaniwsky said estimating that this year alone ackman has faced an estimated $455 million paper loss on herbalife pershing square declined to comment on its herbalife paper losses or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet or the terms on the new put options it has purchased but that didn’t stop ackman on wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company “we’ve been entirely right on our herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business we’ve been wrong on the share price” ackman told cnbc herbalife’s stock has more than doubled since ackman announced his short position an investigation by the federal trade commission that concluded last year tore into herbalife’s business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down pershing square is down 58 percent through the end of september reps from herbalife did not respond to requests to comment herbalife shares were down 24 percent at $7085 wednesday httpsmediumcomkeithakrevanderbiltandthegreatestcornernevertold12f1bffe4d1d the harlem and the hudson were both poorly run lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto manhattan island sensing an opportunity he started to accumulate shares in harlem at the same time vanderbilt was buying there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short that is they were borrowing shares and selling with the hope to buy them back at a lower price netting the difference this group of sellers bears in wall street parlance included members of the new york city council as well as members of the board of directors for harlem rail one of those board members was longtime vanderbilt rival daniel drew with all these inside interests betting on the price of harlem to go down there had to be something going on sure enough a franchise bill that authorized harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded the price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory — except that mr vanderbilt was still on the other side buying everything that was being sold not only did the stock stop going down but it started to rise quickly now for those that do not know shorting a stock can be a dangerous business when you buy a stock go long you only have your investment to lose if you pay $100 for a stock it can only go to $0 thereby wiping out your investment however if you borrow a stock and sell it short there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing if you borrow shares and sell them at $100 and the price goes to $200 you have lost your entire investment but if the price goes to $300 or $400 you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position now imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock if you sold it short at $100 and now you have to buy it back to cover your position what price does the owner set this is the danger of being caught short when someone has ‘cornered’ the market as john brooks explains in his classic “once in golconda “since a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price any finite one is a theoretically a bargain” this is what happened to the short sellers of harlem stock vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy in order to escape complete ruin the city council gave back harlem’s franchise which now vanderbilt owned outright already this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the commodore a ton of money in the process however this was just the beginning watching this epic battle unfold some wall street speculators decided to attack the neighboring hudson rail line this group thought that vanderbilt must be short of cash after all that buying and attention and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit what they did not know was that vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying hudson shares using futures this was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date the intermediaries vanderbilt used were actually part of the shortselling group who would gladly accept the options from the commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market little did the bears know they were selling this stock to allies of vanderbilt who far from being short on cash still had plenty of powder left when finally he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except vanderbilt himself mercifully instead of raising the price to infinity vanderbilt let the shortsellers off relatively easy they weren’t ruined merely badly burned within the span of a couple months cornelius vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process daniel drew still stung from his losses in the failed harlem short decided he wanted one more crack he convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of albany to revoke the franchise for harlem overriding the city council if they revoked the license and shorted harlem stock they could make a bit of money as well this turned out to be a fateful mistake from the great game “drew’s scheme was of course a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring one is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted ‘the statesmen at albany’ ec stedman a veteran of wall street in the 1860’s wrote at the turn of the century ‘in the spring of 1864 were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at new york had plunged themselves less than a year before by their bear campaign against this stock yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt as if vanderbilt has proved an easy victim’” interestingly the timing on this second attempt to ‘bear raid’ harlem stock was in favor of the shorts the price went from $140 down to $101 the greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here instead of covering at a net profit of almost $40 per share the shorts tried to press their advantage “they held on hoping to see it drop to $50” despite really not being very liquid this time around the commodore was still not easily defeated he rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock the price rose to $109 then to $125 and by the end of april was all the way to $224 feeling less charitable than the last time vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price “asked what to do he bellowed ‘put it to a thousand’” fortunately for the shorts and their brokerage houses who also would have been decimated at that price vanderbilt relented and settled at $285 “the second harlem corner was over and there would not be another indeed for a full generation on wall street the phrase ‘short of harlem’ meant much the same thing as ‘up the creek’”,2021-02-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltnc32/history_of_short_squeezes_and_corners/

repurchases this year 2httpswwwberkshirehathawaycom2020arlinksannual20html in addition buffett laid out his bullish case for brk as usual in his annual letter however more important than any of these things as significant as they are is what was missing from the letter this year as many of you rightfully complain buffett has failed to find elephant deals for many years hes complained himself about this every year and warned every year that brk will lag spy in the short term in the meantime hes fiddled with new ways to put the cash to use with sector bets on airlines banks japanese conglomerates etc with this backdrop remember that buffett is not a boomer hes from the silent generation so what he didnt say in the report is really important so what the fuck didnt he say he didnt complain at all about not knowing what to do with cash and didnt warn that brk might lag spy youre not grasping the significance yet let me explain the reason hes been fiddling with sector bets is because these are his replacement for the elephants in fact he explains in his letter linked above that theyre even better he no longer needs to pay a control premium to own them plus he can buy into better businesses that are too valued by their shareholders to be sold entirely to any one owner over the next year the market will transition from an easy money market to one where economic principles and free cash flows matter theres no one more adept at navigating such markets than warren and his colossal brk cash machine also heres some simple math for you sp500 pe ratio 388 brk pe ratio 135 yes i included unrealized capital gains in calculating brks pe thats because brks portfolio is actively managed and it is part of their business model and reported net income this means brks underperformace relative to spy lately was due to earnings multiple contraction in brk while spy experienced multiple expansion this is why buffett didnt warn that brk might underperform hes back in his mojo and

first time poster in wsb and thought it time to make my first contribution i know i know i didnt think my first contribution would be about a jim cramer boomer stock but yea it really is but just follow along with me here i first began the day planning out my next moves for when i start jumping off the tech train like right about now and begin embracing the market for post pandemic retaillife and once the cpi begins to bump the moves for making money in the market during inflation this led me to look at commodities and companies which deals with commodities enter costco i then pull up cost and wonder what the heck am i looking at why is there such a dip ampx200b httpspreviewredditfs582ukeerk61pngwidth501ampformatpngampautowebpampsbd299c206740f45dbfec2923e2483ee9e4fd46cd there must have been some terrible news right being an avid costco shopper to feed my family of 5 i begin researching what terrible thing happened to costco to cause such a rapid selloff but the more i looked the more i realized that this selloff is really just weirdand it could be an opportunity to get some tendiesor rotisserie chickenssee what i did there researching possible causes could it be massive shorting like we all see with other stocks no its only running 098 of shares shorted ampx200b

i come across an article about warren buffet which may explain some things warren buffet sells his shares of costco httpswww dot yahoo dot comlifestylewarrenbuffettdumpsallhiscostcostock3reasonswhythatisabigsurprise235600486html well considering that he sold it off prior to november 16th 2020 could it have been him doing that huge red candle on nov 910th shouldnt the stock have begun to drop from there it should have but it didnt so i looked some more and found that costco announced a special $10 dividend which is pretty highi mean rkt announced a $111 div and thought that was amazing my first thought was that damn costco made a lot of money to do a $10 dividend and second that this drop isnt justified if costco is making a ton of money httpsfinance dot yahoo dot comnewssupermarketchaincostcodeclaresspecial222312149html heres a chart with the dividend marked you can also see that big red candle right before it which could

begins a slow bleed until you see the final crazy selloff at the end and with that $10 dividend in the back of my head im already thinking that this sell off is all sentiment without any real reason so i do some due diligence and look at the financials earning calls etc i then mark them on the chart to see what kind of effect those things had on the price they seemed to help or negate the stock even during this time of speculative hype ampx200b httpspreviewredditk9hpvqcjerk61pngwidth998ampformatpngampautowebpamps830afac11cd00a1ba28c1822105e29a3b5ae78c3 each blue vertical line marks an earnings call where if you zoom in close enough you can easily see the market respond negatively or positively to the results in a pretty normal fashion within a week or so afterwards each call is followed by a swing of about 10 points up or 10 points down typical moves for a stock trading in the hundreds this confirms to me that without a trigger to drop the price of costco there really isnt any reason why the stock is dropping and that any positive earnings should push it back up and any negative earnings should drop it further or remain the same ampx200b httpspreviewredditztl2qhukerk61pngwidth898ampformatpngampautowebpampsa5c4a01bd3fa1ea890684719df463cccf602b57a as you can see the stock is just completely oversold trading outside the bollinger bands

looking through the financials costco has continuously beat its earnings gtthis warehouse club operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two

lwvezn,asx,2.90%,i think igo limited asxigo has an undervalued position as a lithium mining play for the inevitable ev revolution high level dd,dd,24,0.72,veniceking719,42,felt compelled to start a discussion given i can’t find any mainstream analysis regarding what i think has to be one of the stronger lithium plays to make everyone knows the big dogs in the lithium space albemarle alb sqm ganfeng etc and even the smaller speculative players however it seems there is one mining company that’s flown under the radar and quietly secured itself a piece of what i think will be one of the most important lithium mines in the world let me tell you about igo limited asxigo and the deal they made to cut into greenbushes greenbushes mine located in western australia is operated by talison lithium a joint venture by tianqi controlling share and albemarle tianqi bought some shares in sqm at the height of the last lithium boom but since then prices have fallen flat and tianqi is fucked with debt they needed a lifeline and in december 2020 igo was happy to help and secure a piece of the lithium powered future for about 13 billion they secured part of a very valuable asset let me explain below greenbushes mine utilizes the hard rock method of lithium mining and depending on who you ask is the largest such mine on earth raw spodumene is mined that is then processed to lithium carbonate from there it can be refined into lithium hydroxide the most sought after lithiumbased component for ev batteries that is one method of mining lithium the other way is via brining brining is the way they do it in the lithium triangle of south america which is where most of the mainstream attention on lithium mining is placed however i think that when the supply crunch comes brine mining will be be disfavored by ev and battery manufacturers let me explain below hard rock vs brine hard rock has a lower production cost but a lower output yield it is relatively immune from the effects of inclement weather it does not require massive amounts of water and it’s environmental costs are relatively pedestrian compared to brining brine mining has a higher production cost but a higher output however it is affected by inclement weather likely to become a problem over the next 10 years imo requires massive amounts of water and has some pretty steep environmental and political risks source httpswwwwiredcoukarticlelithiumbatteriesenvironmentimpact given the large amount of water required in the brining process and the political effect it has on local and indigenous peoples i don’t think it is viable in the green future ev and battery makers will feel pressure and may even face regulation that their supply chain is carbon neutral green etc when you consider why the ev revolution is happening it doesn’t make sense to buy lithium from a source that requires massive amounts of fresh water a resource that is sure to come under more scrutiny in the next 15 years there is a possibility that innovation could fix the environmental concerns with brining but personally i don’t know if that is likely to happen before the supply crunch that is expected by 2025 now the key $$$ fact is that when a hard rock mine’s lithium carbonate is processed into lithium hydroxide it is the highest margin product in the lithium trade can’t post the graphic but it’s in this source along with other great info sourcehttpspagesmarketintelligencespglobalcomlithiumbrinevshardrockdemoconfirmationmjadhtml brining can also yield lithium hydroxide but it requires an extra step and extra cost in the process to do so so now we know that a hard rock mine that produces lithium hydroxide provides the highest margin product available greenbushes mine has the benefit of a lithium hydroxide refinery vertically integrated into its production cycle the plant is called kwianna and was solely owned by tianqi until igo came in for 13 billion igo secured 2499 stake in greenbushes mine and 49 of kwianna lithium hydroxide plant what’s interesting is that ablemarle tried to buyout tianqi of its greenbushes share in the summer of 2020 from my pov this is indicative of how valuable greenbushes is thankfully the igotianqi deal was structured in a way that per abl spokesman didn’t trigger the right of first refusal clause speculation is that china was loathe to let an asset fall in complete control of a rival giant which makes me think that if tianqis financial troubles continue igo could be in a prime spot to secure an additional stake in greenbushes and kwianna tldr brine mining has credible downsides that i believe are being overlooked which could make hard rock miners more desirable by evbattery manufacturers as more attention is placed on their supply chains and the supply crunch comes to fruition greenbushes is the largest hard rock mine in the world and i believe one of the few that has a lithium hydroxide plant vertically integrated igo is in a unique position having bought into a mine with operations already up and running 25 of the mine and 50 of the refinery it is almost completely absent from all lithium mining discussion by mainstream outlets and i don’t understand why that is relatively new to investing and posting so if there is a reason that igo isn’t a worthwhile play please enlighten me position holding long 550 shares $541 usd and buying more

the uae market and in dirham the local currency there i tried my best to synthesize what little information i could find and come to some sort of conclusion on them first off shuaa is a united arab emiratesbased company engaged in the provision of financial and investment services the company is organized into five segments the asset management segment manages conventional equity debt and money market as well as shariah compliant portfolios and investment funds using both active and passive management styles the investment banking segment provides corporate finance advisory private placements public offerings of equity and debt securities among others the brokerage segment operates under the brand of shuaa securities and acts as principal and agent providing custody and clearing

automod doesnt freak over the penny stock mention ampx200b my moves so even though the acquisition isnt by catalysts big enough to singlehandedly cause a stir i am still very bullish simply due to the hold anghami has in that sector some westernized middle easterners may use spotify or other similar services but what you need to know is the biggest market to hit on is not the same demographic as a middle eastern reddit user to expand on this across various social circles in the middle east and surrounding countries the technology and platforms used also vary significantly more specifically for example a kid from egypt that went to a private school and talks english with his friends and mainly listens to rap and not egyptian music is not the demographic but he is also not the majority in these locales the majority is public schooled people who are not as westernized and mainly listen to egyptian for the sake of our example and similar music from the surrounding culture this exact market is what anghami has completely nailed none of the people who purely want to listen to their regional artists and music will go to any other platform than anghami as a person with a middle eastern background trust me this app is the one taking over in this field kind of similar to how jumia is also taking over the online ordering market by sculpting their services for the areas in which they are offered i would not be surprised if some lowgrade mobile companies team up and have it as a default app for phones sold in this region generally just lots of potential and the team behind the main app has been very good in stimulating growth anghami to merge with

lx6wl6,none,n/a,unfi dd,dd,49,0.81,reddit_eats_tidepods,43,tldr unfi 💎👐🚀🌕 ive been watching unfi for about 4 years now this post is going to be very basic as the last unfi dd post i read had lots of good information theres no point in repeating the same arguments i have a parttime job at a grocery store for insurance over the last four years ive been watching unfi increase their market share and product offerings while the stock price plummeted early on i noticed a large short interest currently its around 22 and has been for quite some time you have to ask yourself why would there be a large short interest throughout a pandemic for a dine at home stock one could certainly argue the mismanaged acquisition of svu greatly contributed to this however something that i have not heard mentioned in any due diligence report on unfi is the lawsuit against goldman sachs for the unfair terms of the loan it was around this period in time that i began to notice how large is the short interest was it is my guess and opinion because of this lawsuit unfi is being punished by way of short interest i have not heard anyone mention this as a potential reason for such a high short interest during the last four years i have seen unfi gobble up a significant amount of brands increasing their distribution to our store from about 10 of our product offering line to well over 50 dont take my word for it you can go into any grocery store and look at the tag on the shelf and it will tell you which distributor the product comes from if youve been paying attention to this and who would you would find a consistent increase in their market share in fact recently they acquired 62 qfc locations in my area this tells me more than any potential amazon contract i in fact dont care whether or not they get the amazon go stores because i think those will flop in the longterm that being said a lot of people are looking at the amazon contract as a sign of success and its my opinion that they will retain that contract but i couldnt care less let us know talk cerebrally about their shipping issues recently i saw three drivers unloading a unfi truck and i jokingly asked them if they were union drivers having three people control one truck they responded by saying no they were training new drivers from jb hunt to deliver their products in my area this replaces a complicated intricate system of independent owner operators consolidating their shipping costs into one account as opposed to hundreds of accounts is going to save them a lot of money my bottom line is that unfi continually increases their market share and the synergies will be realized from the svu acquisition in fairly short order this is my yolo play and im planning on holding it upwards of $100 a share my guess is that we could reach over $200 a share within two years as you can see in my previous post i hold 2600 shares if i could create a gif for this stock it would be a turtle with a rocket strapped to its back on a skateboard someone posted this exact gif on yahoo finance board and it is so accurate i feel very comfortable with this stock and although i check it multiple times a day its not something that i need to do i sleep like a baby at night one thing that i will caution yall about is the earnings reports never send the stock skyrocketing in fact last earnings report they crushed it and their stock did absolutely nothing over the week after earnings this is of absolutely no concern to me when you have a high short interest and low volume trading this sort of thing is to be expected a negative point about this company very important to include in an unbiased assessment is the general silence from the board about what theyre doing however im looking at this through the lens of theyre too busy expanding their business instead of making hyped up press releases and this just gives me more confidence in the stock for the mid and longterm this is the way,2021-03-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx6wl6/unfi_dd/

lx75uz,pep,6.43%,pepsico pep is the market undervaluing this dividend staple,discussion,11,0.65,liftasaurusrex,26,okay so here are my thoughts behind nestle pepsico is the biggest company in its sector by revenue it also follows coke stock fairly closely but what made the difference this last year was how these two comparable soda giants fared during covid 19 ko or coke performed extremely poorly and made less money yoy its payout ratio for its dividend was touching 94 meaning they only had 6 left over after paying out their shareholders thats not a lot of money to do much of anything with especially in an industry that needs to move towards new products with the decline in popularity of soda to compare with pepsico which even during the pandemic found a way to make more revenue in 2020 than in 2019 to give you specific numbers in 2018 was an increase in total revenue by 179 compared to 2017 in 2019 it increased 387 compared to 2018 and in 2020 increased a 478 which might i remind you that this increase happened during the pandemic now why did pepsico do well against their main rival coke to answer this in simple terms their portfolio was more diversified than cokes and they focused on releasing new and more popular products as well as packaged food which saw a huge boost in sales from toilet paper bandits or panic shoppers stocking up on bags of fritos lays cheetos and on the healthier side of things quaker oats and other products until recently most people thought coke stock was king between the two companies but i believe 2020 may have put pepsi on the podium as our clear winner of the cola wars pepsi has a dividend yield of 312 and a payout ratio of 7988 coke has a dividend yield of 335 and a payout ratio of 9385 with the payout ratios so high i am a little concerned for dividend increases for both but i would be shocked if coke raised it any more than they had to to keep their dividend status share price i see pepsico valued at $15436 a share trevis evaluation puts then at $15016 which i believe is low but close to a 20 dollar per share increase or more either way this is an upside of 1846 not including dividends and i calculated coke to be valued at $5272 a share trevis evaluation puts it at $5548 which is more than i calculated taking the higher of the two numbers this leave a share price upside of around 1100 there are many other reasons i believe pepsi is going to be the better long term pick like how they released the new cocktail mixers neon zebra which i would love to try to take some of the cocktail mixer marketshare which the mixer market tops 858 mm$ and an industry that grew 35 just last year cocktail culture is coming to north america and in the united states and canada we are heavily accepting these delicious mixers that are premade and easy to make what are your thoughts on these two companies or their sectors in general do you think pepsico is undervalued or do you think coke is still a better buy let me know in the comments disclaimer i am long pepsico and hold positions in the stock mentioned above,2021-03-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx75uz/pepsico_pep_is_the_market_undervaluing_this/

lx9d65,none,n/a,the elixir of inflation short term interest rates and why stonks will go up,dd,25,0.75,stylizedportfolio,32,yet another day tsla and tech stocks got crushed due to rise in yields i feel this is an over reaction because the 10yr bond yields are just at where they were precovid i outline below why there wont be any rise in the short term interest rates atleast till the end of 2023 and why stonks will go up unemployment claims and inflation unemployement rate in january was 63 and the feds natural rate of unemployement stands at around 4 the fed has cited that if we were to include millions of people who quit the labor force and other misclassifactions the rate could go up to 10 so even though we are reopening there is a very high rate of unemployement across the country in feb 2020 us had the lowest unemployement in its history at 35 and guess what the inflation number was less than 2 effect of stimmy and infrastructure package there is around $19 trillion stimulus package on the way and plan for a $2 trillion infrastructure package later if both of them were to get through i doubt the infrastrucure deal the expectation is that in the extreme case we might reach the 32 unmployement rate which is good sooner early 2022 than later with industries moving to automation on a large scale lower unemployement rates are hard to sustain but with the reopening there might be a spike in inflation but that will quickly subside due to the forces of globalization opening up supply chains cheap labor and goods this is a case for lower unemployement and lower inflation how will we pay back the federal debt the inflation elixir we dont need to worry about higher debt we only need to look at the level of public debt relative to gdp because the costs of any debt level are less important when the economy is larger the economy can be made larger in two ways 1 increase in real production 2 increase in the prices of the produced goods being a developed economy there is only so much the us can increase real gdp the elixir of inflation will solve the problem for us here is a simple example assume that inflation returns to feds target of 2 per year and the gdp growth rate is 15 then the nominal growth rate would be 35 guess how much uncle sam pays for borrowing 07 percent per year on its 10year borrowing and 01 percent per year on its 3month borrowing through 2021 at the end of 2019 155 percent and 192 percent  even without a primary budget surplus the net effect of interest payments and growth would be to shrink the debtgdp ratio at a rate of 20   35 – 15 percent per year when inflation rate is at 2 assume the reduction in debt when inflation rises to 3 or 4 this reduction would increase to 3 and 4 per year which is huge the same has happened after world war ii when debt to gdp ratio is at current levels and it got diluted over the years because of inflation and the only way we will be able achieve is through lower rates which is good for stonks overall i believe the fed will opt for a higher inflation target around 34 before finally moving to increase any short term rates tldr overvalued tech stocks might be taking a beating but the marker overall is poised to move up whether we see inflation or not interest rates are going to be low atleast for the next three years if not more else uncle sam cant pay his debt back positions long spy,2021-03-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx9d65/the_elixir_of_inflation_short_term_interest_rates/

rise or fall since each price represents crowd consensus at the moment of transaction trad ers are betting on the future opinion and mood of the crowd the crowd keeps swinging from hope to fear and

loyalty was essential for a prehistoric hunter’s survival joining a union can help even an incompetent performer keep his jobthe market is different joining a group tends to hurt you gtmany traders are puzzled why markets reverse immediately after they dump their losing positionthis happens because crowd members are gripped by the same fear— and everybody dumps at the same time once the selling fit has ended the market has nowhere to go but up optimism returns to the marketplace and the crowd forgets fear grows greedy and goes on a new buying binge gtthe crowd is bigger and stronger than you

sharpness of any rally depends on how traders feel if buyers feel just a little stronger than sellers the market rises slowly when they feel much stronger than sellers the market rises fast it is the job of a technical analyst to find when buyers are strong and when they start running out of steam gtshort sellers feel trapped by rising markets as their profits melt and turn into losseswhen short sellers rush to cover a rally can become parabolic fear is a much stronger emotion than greed2 rallies driven by short covering are especially sharp although they do not last very long gtmarkets fall because of fear among bulls and greed among bears normally bears prefer to sell short on rallies but if they expect to make a lot of money on a decline they don’t mind shorting on the way down fearful buyers agree to buy only below the market as long as short sellers are willing to meet those demands and sell at a bid the decline will continue gtas bulls’ profits melt and turn into losses they

for example indicators may give you buy signals in two markets should you buy the one that declined a lot before the buy signal or the one that declined a little compare this to what happens to a man

patterns reflect the sum of buying and selling greed and fear among investors and traders many charts in this book are daily with each bar representing one trad ing day but the rules for understanding weekly daily or intraday charts are remark ably similar gtremember this key principle “each price is a momentary consensus of value of all market participants expressed in action” based on it each price bar provides several important pieces of information about the tugofwar between bulls and bears figure 171 gtthe opening price of a daily bar tends to reflect the amateurs’ opinion of value they read morning papers find out what happened the day before perhaps ask for a wife’s approval to buy or sell and place their orders before driving to work ama teurs are especially active early in the day and early in the week gttraders who researched the relationship between opening and closing prices found that opening prices most often occur near the high or the low of the daily bar buying or selling by amateurs early in the day creates an emotional extreme from which prices tend to recoil later in the day gtin bull markets prices often make their low for the week on monday or tuesday when amateurs take profits from the previous week then rally to a new high on thursday or friday in bear markets the high for the week is often set on monday or tuesday with a new low toward the end of the week gtthe closing prices of daily and weekly bars tend to reflect the actions of profes sional tradersthey watch the markets throughout the day respond to changes and tend to dominate the last hour

total yesterday while everyone was crying about the market taking a shit and rkt crashing i was crying toohttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentslx7mlzrkt12k114k17k it was announced znga acquired a game studio echtra gameshttpsventurebeatcom20210303zyngaacquiresdiablococreatorsechtragamesinexpansiontopcandconsoles whose creator and his team played a pivital role in diablodiablo ii they were acquired with the goal to help zynga move into pccrossplatform game play i think this is a promising acquisition with lots of future potential and is just one of many planned for this yearhttpstechcrunchcom20210210zyngaq4earnings the ceo of zynga also spoke at a conference with morgan stanley today below are some excerpts he said during the call that i found interesting ampx200b well known established global ip data driven iteration proven game mechanics 🚀 gtwe like to learn from what weve done before and in the case of harry potter that was a big element of it one of the things that we learned was we needed an intellectual property in a world that was appealing to a much larger audience and a much more global audience so that a lot of the cool game play features that we had could reach a bigger audience so we combined a new ip with some proven mechanics that wed been messing around with and then we tested it for a very long period of time and test markets thats really the structural difference between mobile and console gt gtin mobile you can really test market something to remove a lot of the introduction risk and so with harry potter that was something that we did as we went into whether it was australia or canada we were testing very specific elements of what makes for a successful game does it retain does it engage whats the conversion rates does the ua scale against what the cost of acquisition is and so we thoroughly put harry potter through its test marketing phases and what were really excited about was first and foremost the reception from fans was phenomenal gt gtwe saw the ratings were very strong the harry potter fans were raving about it it went really viral we did some fun stuff with zayn malik and it really had really a lot of nice momentum out of the launch but then when it started to hit weeks 14 30 and beyond all the testing that we had done about what were the retention rates engagements we were exceeding them so it was actually really positive to see that the test marketing worked and that was a critical part of the success here the harry potter ip is a money machine if you can integrate the game mechanics that get people to continually make micro transactions or spend hours playing combined with a raving fan base of an established global ip imo this is going to print money for them the harry potter game was launched on sep23httpsinvestorzyngacomnewsreleasesnewsreleasedetailszyngalaunchesharrypotterpuzzlesspellsworldwide i think we could see a lift in revenue in the coming quarters from this game ampx200b 2 upcoming game releases in the first half theyre targeting 2 new game releases in the first half puzzle combat and farmville 3 on puzzle combat gtso as we think about releasing puzzle combat in the first half i wouldnt necessarily set the expectations that this is a theatrical movie model where its a marvel movie that comes out at summer and its got this huge spike thats not at all the model here right were in this for the longterm this is a marathon not a sprint and so were going to be releasing the game see how it settles in and then very methodically start acquiring based on what were seeing in the dynamics and the metrics on farmville gtand there are a lot of fans that have tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of people had played farmville over the years and when we think about all of those fans and what their expectations are and how to bring them into a new experience we’ve doing a lot of testing we’re also running a bunch of farmville games right now whether it’s country escape or tropic escape which has a very big fan base and they love the game gt gtand so it’s a little bit more complicated to navigate some of the preset expectations but what we’ve done is really build out a terrific new experience and experience that is unlike la it has things that are familiar to people that have played farmville in the past but it’s got a lot of unique new elements to it and a new look and feel that feels very modern and very cutting edge for what we believe mobile games really are these days puzzle combat is more of a long play and i like these types of strategies mixed in with shorter term plays zynga seems to have a healthy balance of this which i really like what i think zynga does well is tailoring their games to the fan base i think fv3 is going to be a fresh reboot of the beloved game by its fans with new elements to keep users engaged ampx200b expansion into crossplatform gaming as mentioned they acquired echtra to boost their expansion into crossplatform gaming unrelated to the acquisition one of the first crossplatform titles later this year will be star wars hunters ampx200b gtyeah i think if you take a step back and look at the industry overall some of the largest franchises in the world right now are crossplatform and they’re free to play in many cases with seasons passes and things like fortnite pub g engine impact a lot of people have been talking about how the console developers getting into mobiles the thing well i think that door swings both ways i think mobile developers can actually step into the crossplatform mega franchise part of the market because of a few reasons ampx200b regarding the team they acquired ampx200b gti think the last point i’d make on crossplatform is that we’re just getting started in this so the acquisition of echtra is really a key one for us because ultimately game quality is a function of game team talent and leadership and when you look at these guys they’ve worked on rpgs for up their whole careers they’ve worked on diablo they helped to create torchlight which is a fantastic ip and the action rpg category they’ve actually published games crossplatform it’s a team less than 50 in san francisco right near our shop i think if the launch of star wars hunters goes well in the second half of the year then i think its possible we see a nice upward movement on the price ampx200b becoming a first party ads platform cutting out third party platforms like googleapple ampx200b gtmidpoint the last year we started looking at the fact that we were one of the premier advertisers in gaming all of our games are enabled for iap and iaa but between the time that they saw an ad and they ended up in our game we had it was kind of opaque right we worked with other parties – other third particles or use other thirdparties like iron source or unity app and google facebook and the thirdparties were handling a lot of the information and a lot of the acquisition and then we looked at our first party data asset which is the data that we were generating around what a player was doing inside of our games gt gtand that was tremendously valuable but we were missing that piece of it and so when we looked at it we said wait a second if we do a couple of things here we can capture the 15 to 30 we’re paying partners right now just to manage the exchanges we would get more information about what’s hot and what’s not at the top of the funnel in terms of what’s appealing what’s not appealing what companies or products are doing better and why we would be able to creatively optimize our products better we ended in a post idfa world that would all become first party data the big issue with privacy is what is one party exchanging to another party about an individual right but if you enter one network and you have a good exchange of what your permissions are you carry through that whole process in a high fidelity way from a data standpoint gt gtand so when we looked at it from multiple directions were like wow we can margin expand we can pick up more efficiency in our ua dollars and in our advertising business we could grow our advertising business faster and we could generate potentially a competitive advantage and information superiority just knowing more about the players coming into our walled garden or into our platform than the next guy gt gtwe felt like this was something that we could go after we went through a very diligent process of breaking down what these look like and we found that some of these components we could build some of these components we need to partner on and in addition to that in ad tech theres a lot of theres really a lot of vibrant companies and opportunities out there to potentially partner as youve seen from recent development gt gtso when we think about where we were as a company we were a mobile pure play developer and publisher and we felt that that is a really valuable company but we thought that we could become an even more valuable company by building out our platform by starting to grow our total addressable market by getting into consoles and pcs and then leveraging this unique asset and hyper casual to really supercharge the platform as well as get us into a place where were seeing more information coming into the top of the funnel and then converting them into players and ultimately payers this really sticks out to me zynga was 1 step ahead from the new pivot by applegoogle on stronger ad tracking privacy theyre becoming the ads exchange where companies pay for displaying ads in games this also gives them an advantage on learning whats working for others and apply that to their business model heres a bite sizedhttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsljywiczngautmsourceshareamputmmediumiosappamputmnameiossmf dd ujojofroyo did disclaimer this is not financial advice i am not a financial advisor do your

anyway going back to pubmatic this little company ipod in december 2020 and basically for most of december didnt have much movement in their stock price unlike our little friends above who saw their stock prices skyrocket in the month of december then come january and february pubmatic started getting some traction as investors started realizing pubmatics potential in this space but the real

companies guide with some padding they are also gaap profitable most tech companies are nongaap profitable due to stockbased compensation which cuts into earnings but this little company is profitable already their net income margin for q4 was 335 which is incredible and for the year they finished with a 179 net income margin despite covid beating the crap out of this business in q2 this is a

httpswwwglassdoorcomreviewspubmaticreviewse256835htmhttpswwwglassdoorcomreviewspubmaticreviewse256835htm valuation when it comes to tech companies given their lack of gaap profitability they are often

i have no idea which source is correct all i know is this stock is incredibly volatile despite solid results perhaps its due to it being a new ipo or something but the stock skyrocketed to $76 before cratering down to $52 due to the recent market volatility and i wouldnt doubt that the high short float whatever it is is causing that to some degree regardless it does seem like a prime candidate for a potential short squeeze if $rkt could double with a short float of 38 or so and it being a $30 b company prior to the squeeze i would anticipate a company that is lt $3 b in market cap and doesnt have a ton of trading volume everyday could see some potential uptick wrapping up i think pubmatic is a great company they seem to be executing flawlessly and are guiding for continued strength and are in an industry with huge secular tailwinds i anticipate this company will do very well by its own but given how much short interest there is this could be an interesting play too disclosure long

articlehttpswwwinsidercomclassicchildrensbooksthathaventagedwell20195ifiranthezoobytheodorseussgeiselakadrseusshasbeencriticizedforcontainingnumerousoffensiveimages1 sort of called it almost two years ago—the first book on their list is if i ran the zoo in addition to the above mentioned insider article i looked through several lists of books that are being challenged for racial content my analysis leads me to believe that the indian in the cupboard by lynne reid banks currently being published by harper collins is a prime candidate for a discontinued book squeeze heres why 1 low search volume heres a google trends graph of how often the recalled dr seuss books were searched for on amazon httpspreviewredditd178buhtl2l61pngwidth2322ampformatpngampautowebpamps4ad443bc373d439abe34e87d8fbd8c8d04ffd32a notice how theres nobody trying to buy these books this makes sense no publisher in their right mind would discontinue a popular childrens book this is why books like the cat in the hat or peter pan which have also been criticized will never go out of print it would be a financial nightmare in contrast look at how indian in the cupboard stacks up against some other contenders ampx200b httpspreviewreddit1xe9dbpun2l61pngwidth2306ampformatpngampautowebpamps01e3995810de807ae599684cd690ba7efc2149b7 if you follow the red trendline you will see that searches for indian in the cupboard amazon are effectively 0 with some slight upticks every now and then this contrasts with amazon searches for titles like little house on the prairie which sees consistent search frequency discontinuing further printings of the indian in the cupboard will probably have little impact on harpercollins margins 2 broad readership base particularly among middleaged readers in addition to being discontinued a book will need to have excess demand before the price will surge this will happen only if the book has a broad readership base in dr seusss case so many adults have probably read at least one of the 6 discontinued books growing up hell i loved mulberry street when i was little which is why theyre actually buying up these books now that theyve become limited edition items it probably helps that dr seuss wrote his books to help children read and literally every elementary school still uses his writing to teach literacy skills similarly the indian in the cupboard was actually wellreceived in the 80s and was incorporated into school curriculums nationwide you can still find entire teaching guides built around the indian in the cupboard and i distinctly remember reading this book and filling out worksheets back in third grade 2009 yeah this book isnt as popular as it once was but im willing to bet that in the 40 years that its been out its been able to build a solid fanbase of readers who will buy a copy out of nostalgia once this book gets banned this also gives the indian in the cupboard an advantage over books like pippi longstocking which—despite being a childrens book with low search volume—is beloved in sweden but has a much smaller audience in america 3 history of contentious debate the controversy over dr seusss books didnt just happen overnight although it certainly felt that way his books have been banned in libraries for years and there are argumentshttpswwwnbcnewscomnewsnbcblkreckoningdrseussracistimageryhasbeenyearsmakingn1259330 going all the way back to the 90s about whether his books are racist this is the same situation that the indian in the cupboard finds itself in its been removed from numerous public libraries and the american library association leadership advised educators to avoid the book as far back as 1991 this is important because the decision to remove books is typically timesensitive given almost 30 years to consider whether or not to discontinue publishing harper collins likely has enough financial data and a good picture of consumer preferences especially under the current political climate to decide that they will stop further publications of the indian in the cupboard its important to keep in mind that there is significantly less liquidity with trading books than stocks however books are still less volatile and like art pieces tend to appreciate in value over time i think that the indian in the cupboard is a longterm hold which has the potential to increase ten fold when it inevitably gets pulled from

m4bb9v,dkng,4.86%,the dkng legislative gamble,dd,8,0.9,blaclaureate,30,for those in dkng there are potentially momentous events coming up in the next few months as state legislative sessions are coming to a close from now through about june this could explain why there is a lot of unusual option activity around august at the 90c the states in play and their progress on passing sports gambling either retail or mobile texas two lawmakers filed legislation this week that would legalize casinos and sports betting in texas hjr133 was filed in the house on tuesday and sjr49 filed in the senate the texas governor has also voiced support for the bill as well as the sports betting alliance which represents teams like the dallas mavericks the dallas cowboys and the rangers the sports betting alliance has showed favoritism towards online sports betting too this bill is supported between the two parties and the legislative session runs to the end of may florida legislative sessions are in progress and run to april 30th the key part of negotiations is the seminole tribe of florida they offer a heavy endorsement as they run all casinos in the state of florida if they’re brought to the table in support of this bill soon we could see some real pressure as the governor is open to legalizing sports betting too though as it stands it doesn’t seem likely in this session arizona session ends on may 28th bill passed the house but faces political scrutiny in the senate governor supports the legislation but its chance could end up grim if it gets stalled because of another bill trying to get horse racing on the ballot maryland session ends in earlymid april i think the 12th hogan is basically ready to sign this thing it includes online sports betting too this one practically a done deal south dakota march 29th marks the end of the session the bill in this state easily cleared both the senate and house governor is expected to sign off kansas session ends may 30th the bill passed the senate but its now in the house lawmakers in kansas largely support the bill but there appears to be disagreements for who gets the gambling licenses the senate bill included 11 or 12 online gambling licenses of which dkng is included of course dkng could have a great year if some of these go through and could have an explosive one if they all do the pandemic took a toll on these states and they need as much taxes as they can get sports betting is one way they can do that and it has bipartisan support across the aisle considering the dkng already rose their estimates for the year they could be thinking that their chances are looking good as well as with all things political buy the rumor and sell the news here’s to a maybe good year my kings and queens cheers 🍻,2021-03-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4bb9v/the_dkng_legislative_gamble/

discussion last week even ihor mentioned it despite you fucks not being able to read his replies to various feedback are below the data short volume today friday 12th 5793090 sv 5891 his si$ range 6908 10388 daily notes oddly slow day as fat call options expire as they were being boughten by the thousands minutes before market closed extremely low long volume retail just holding off market trades bull instituations still carried us possible sizeable shorts were place today ampx200b

be 80 of all offmarket and long volume trades to be under 100 i changed the formula for the cost of om volume to match the lowest price of the days as the off market is mainly darkpool trades new conclusions we can conclude that the of volume used for covering is far less than their average of 3075 since the 15th of january as a result of a big ol fomo rally from retail and a bull effort from institutions hogging up that volume therefore it is not crazy to derive that si is over 700 with a cost well over 5 billion $ to do so important notes what i found was a tendency for these short sellers to get cocky and not cover on weeks when you would have expected them to this means some weaks with low sv had huge net gains in shorts this never worked in reverse in the data ampx200b httpspreviewreddit1j1f094h6um61pngwidth1031ampformatpngampautowebpampsc000f8086573c128e653722ed86117985e43b4cb proof that finra data is impossible if you were to take the finra data from the 15th of january to the 24th of february you would find that they wouldve needed to cover using 3032 of all transfers for the entire month and a half proof 1 it would have been impossible for them to comprise that portion of the covering with the fomo wave and gamma squeeze that was hogging the data at the time this 3032 is notable there was a considerable boost in daily volume in that period so you are talking about a minimal cost of 3446 billion dollars using my formulas from my previous data that being the bare minimum amount just to lower it to the si they said it was at proof 2 we have not witnessed a loss of 2265 billion usd or more from institutions in that time that would have been a net loss btw no bankruptcies were seen either i said above that i noticed that short sellers did not cover when the data suggested they had the opportunity that this trend never reversed a high weekly sv yielded a net gain in short positions proof 3 sv has remained over 50 throughout the 15th to 24th period which provides evidence of a net gain in shorts not a complete dip of the si lastly if all this was the way they say it did then proof 4 the stock price would not have dropped during the period if they had covered the data heavily implies that shorts are used and held to stop upwards momentum ampx200b his reposnse to feedback ampx200b gtshort volume of total volume cant reliably tell you how many new shorts have entered or covered that day because belowa market maker selling you a share that they havent yet matched up with an actual seller but do a few seconds later will get counted as a short position momentarily this apparently can and does happen and gets counted in the short volume meaning exactly no new short positions were taken but the short volume went up anyway i believe this is actually explained on finras website httpswwwfinraorgrulesguidancenoticesinformationnotice051019httpswwwfinraorgrulesguidancenoticesinformationnotice051019 on the flip side it does tell you the absolute highest number of short positions that could have been taken that day so new short positions could be anywhere between 0 and the high short volume amount but due to the above as well as shorts entering and the covering in the same day means you cant really gleam anything from it reliably sorry 1 what you are describing would create a net neutral movement on the share price which was not seen more importantly the data i aquired clearly shows that there was a net gain of shorts when compared to the long volume which is where they could have covered day after day after day it is possible but the data says that they have been creating more shares than they can possibly cover even if they were 100 of the long volume everyday which as we know is 90 algos and day traders i look at things from a scientific lens all i aimed to do was to show that it is financially and numerically impossible for si to have lowered since the 15th of january it was the running assumption that everyone who believed in this had and i provided damning evidence for it being the case ampx200b gtthis is not how it works not saying that gme short interest is x or y but literally this is not how it works you really can’t use short volume to determine short interest interpreting daily finra short sale reports mods please don’t delete 📷 i’ve seen a lot of posts about finra daily short sale reports and what it means importantly it doesn’t mean what you think this isn’t fud it’s just how market making works tldr a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate buy orders and they immediately cover with the next trade high short volume in the finra report actually often reflects net buying this is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless that sounds crazy but that’s how market making works finra report is only for off exchange trades dark pools it’s a myth that dark pools are all institutional your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like citadel virtu etc1402a mm makes money on the spread between buying and selling obviously what happens is your order to buy 100 shares of gme at market gets sent to a dark pool the mm a computer shorts you those shares at $108793 and then buys those shares back at $108791 a short of 100 shares is recorded this also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50m float the mm isn’t “going short” gme they short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later so high short volume in the finra report which is only reflecting off exchange trades dark pools does not necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting it often reflects high levels of buying um like we just saw this week repeat that it does also does not reflect exchange trades you don’t have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here generally speaking the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true it’s just not for the reasons you think ampx200b i didnt assume you were fud but its a little sus when you open like that hahahahh same as my answer for the last one my data clearly shows that financially and data wise there are more shorts being taken on most days where the only way for them to even be below what they were on the 15th would be for them to litterally bankrupt themselves in the process what you describe there would have a net neutral effect on the share price share price plummetted as short volume exceeded long volume that is the fact the data disagrees with your rebuttal ampx200b gtno this post is misinformation you cannot gauge short interest from short volume because a majority of short volume is closed in seconds i keep telling people this you should really make a wiki or sidebar notice about short volume so much misinformation and misplaced hype because of short volume high short volume does not mean high short interest to be clear i believe short interest is super high for gme but not due to short volume there has been lots of legit dd done on this but focusing on short volume is straight misinformation propagated by people who dont know what theyre talking about ampx200b 3 same as the top two maybe try and actually take the time to read my the data i took hours transcribing and making palletable before waving it off and calling me fake news k in conclusion the data proves that si has gone up the only argument ive heard is the they cover instantly one which isnt whats shown in the data at all its litterally the entire point of me showing short volume overflow to show how many more shorts there are compared to longs daily if it were true wed have risen consistently as this theory would have 0 effect on the share price what actually happened is they shorted it to 40$ ampx200b personally as in umoonski s opinion the feedback from you all is excellent and whilst i am still sceptical of the high s and the total accuracy of the derived info i still think it is very valuable in at least showing that reported si is esesntially total horseshit all we really have is s3 amp finra delayed self reported data telling us si is constantly dropping yet price action does not suppport such a low liquidity stock being covered from over 200 si in january also very weirdly the data goblin himself ihor of s3 aka the ihorse hes ihors3 on twitter ffs tweeted yesterday that gme is a 1010 on his new squeeze score aka the squeezeometer how this is derived is a secret so its 1010 squeeze potential yet si is plumetting at a mere 15 according to himself mhm thus i am still totally convinced that si is gt100 and this data shows that there is no way it is what is being report by the likes of s3 or finra is accurate what we are doing here if not proving to you what the magical si number definitely is is showing that si is substantially higher than what reports are claiming i am also certain gme has a significant issue with synthetic shares due to the volume of trading being a significant of the total free float size of 50m more like 24m in reality amc a popular meme stock trades at 30 float and most non meme popular stocks trade far far far lower than this in terms of volume float interestingly i did come across this si was at 132 on feb 8th according to samppglobal you know the guys whos name is in the sampp500 in an article posted on feb 18 httpswwwspglobalcommarketintelligenceennewsinsightslatestnewsheadlinesshortinterestinusstocksdeclinesinaftermathofgamestopsagadatashows62699063httpswwwspglobalcommarketintelligenceennewsinsightslatestnewsheadlinesshortinterestinusstocksdeclinesinaftermathofgamestopsagadatashows62699063 they later claimed on march 2nd that si had dropped to 24 in mid february which makes absolutely no sense given price action 132 to 24 as the stock hoves around $40 ok then so yeah enjoy your saturday

taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization financial flexibility and create a public market for their stock net proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including working capital operating expenses and capital expenditures coupang is currently not planning to pay dividends and rather invest in themselves i really like this because they know exactly what and where their assets are and implies they will be heavily reinvesting into those assets in attempts to grow them amazon has and is using the same formula by not paying dividends not focusing on revenue but focusing on growing their brand recognition and customer base their largest asset amazons ttm use of cash graph below which i predict will mirror coupangs in the future again though i don’t know anything 📷 profitability on a gaap basis was not positive however from a cash flow basis they generated over 300m from operations and continue to generate cash flow in order to boost their operations and reinvest in themselves and grow their customer base which continues to be their strongest asset opportunity koreas gdp “gross

expanding into smart tvs and pcs coupang play has everything from hollywood movies like the spiderman series and “bombshell to popular korean movies and tv shows i’d name them but i don’t think any of us know what they are coupang play also has documentaries educational videos kids shows and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the only streaming service in korea where users are able to watch things like bryan cranstons show “your honor” and cnn 10 stephen kim the head of coupang play is also on record for saying “we are eager to bring content such as coupang play originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers” coupang eats has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in korea which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by coupang coupang eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for rocket delivery and rocket fresh making delivery as fast and efficient as possible coupangs customer centricity continues to be their most important asset as 70 of the population is 7 miles from a distribution center the company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to “pursue operational excellence and innovation” in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have customer base has also grown by an approximate 148 million from 2019 to 2020 up more than 25 part of coupangs business model states all of this and i would have reworded it but it truly is perfect and i don’t think i could have done a better job when i first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company not to mention again that this is very similar to how amazon approached their business in the early years the statement is as follows “we believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term our longterm investments in building a differentiated technologyorchestrated network and customerfacing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale we have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully such as with our ownedinventory selection rocket wow membership rocket fresh and coupang eats among others we will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers we will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our shortterm results” top risks coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth same strategy as amazon so in my eyes not a downside dilution the company has stated that there will be was immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing out of all the evidence from coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow i believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion i believe this dilution is why coupang had a red day on friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out this does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses however i think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding as well as just going public still though it lessens shareholders position and lowers pe which is a measure of profitability but again we know coupang is not focusing on this at the moment all this changes in my eyes is that i’m going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends i have tried looking around for other reasons why coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south korea but i have yet to find any info if anyone does a link would be greatly appreciated and i will edit with new info tdlr in my opinion based on everything i’ve read and compiled here i truly think coupang has unlimited potential the company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself its constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with coupang play and rocket fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets their management team looks very promising with backgrounds in amazon uber and a fuck load of computer engineering year after year revenue has been up customer base has been up and operating loss and net loss have been down this company looks very promising in my eyes and i definitely will be investing in coupang in years to come thanks to everyone who stuck through all this again its my first ever dd so hopefully its not too shit i put a lot of effort and research into this and i hope yall gain some insight to this awesome company please let me know if theres anything i should’ve included in this i am hoping to get a lot better at this whole “stonks” thing as you may have noticed i haven’t given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly simply because i’m waiting for my next paycheck so i can afford to buy some i currently don’t own shares in coupang but you can bet your ass i’m buying as much as i can the next time i have money to throw at the market wouldn’t you want to get into amazon in 2005

m4cclb,the,n/a,the week of the gme gamma,dd,20,0.83,bevans2810,16,first time poster lifetime retard 22 gme $175 be ive mulled over a couple of posts on gamma squeezes option chains and the moon landing date of 19 march 2021 so thought id throw some of my own numbers around and check were all staying extra retarded ive had a look at the call option chains for 12 march 21 19 march 21 and 26 march 21 and have ignored absolutely everything else ape logic my conclusion is that this week the markets will not close at the same price they opened undeniable at expiry 12 march 21 inthemoney itm call options totalled 33485 the sum of open interest at strikes below $26450 on the assumption these itm options are all exercised thats 335 million shares 62 of float 5417m being bought at gme market price of $26450 to fulfill the contracts totalling $8857m ok if gme stays flat at $26450 until expiry of the 19 march 21 calls the number of itm calls almost doubles to 59338 exercise would mean 593 million shares 11 of float bought to fulfill totalling $157 billion nice the gme open interest falls drastically with 26 march 21 calls with only 8867 itm calls at the same gme price of $26450 a relatively tiny 887k shares totalling $2345m boring in ape terms the above means i think were in for an exciting week if gme price stays flat and all calls expiring on 19 march 21 are exercised call writers must buy 11 of the float to fulfill the contracts this is a substantial figure especially when 100 of apes are not selling maths moreover the more shares that are bought to fulfill the exercised calls the greater the increase in price my extensive knowledge of economics allows me to define this as supply and demand therefore more calls become itm and the process is rinsedandrepeated the maya jama squeeze but wait theres more ive noted certain price points on the option chain that would lead to call writers being required to buy more than 05 of float theres probably a fancy name for this but remember im retarded ive indicated this by strike price of float below for the 12 march 21 calls price points included 200 08 250 05 300 17 350 06 400 11 500 12 600 05 and 800 67 the 17 at 300 could go some way to explaining the upward resistance we saw last week as holding 300 would have meant a total of 96 of float $14 billion would have been needed to be bought to fulfill all itm calls gme not holding above $300 saved call option writers a minimum of $230m however for the 19 march 21 calls there are more price points and at lower prices these include 39 06 60 05 95 08 100 08 150 06 200 05 300 11 350 08 400 10 500 17 600 07 and 800 57 gme holdingsurpassing these prices over the next week should lead to bananas for all gme holding the following prices by the end of next week would lead to the following shares being bought by call writers to fulfill itm options price shares of float cost $250 58m 108 $154b $300 68m 126 $180b $350 74m 138 $197b $400 82m 151 $217b $450 86m 159 $227b $500 96m 178 $255b to conclude i will be hodling please note i am retarded and this is not financial advice apes dont need advice i appreciate that solely analysing the call option chain is of very narrow scope with so many moving parts to consider but i am too retarded to consider much more if any fellow ape has comments improvements or corrections to make to the above then please do so happy to share my retarded spreadsheet used to calculate the above if requested,2021-03-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4cclb/the_week_of_the_gme_gamma/
m4cka9,gme,-6.49%,gme technicals dd short interest,dd,47,0.92,homedepothank69,221,this will be long apes so please bull with me this is going to be a breakdown of gmes chart from a technical perspective as well as my thoughts on the short interest and where this is all going i would just like to apologize in advance for all of the lines on my charts i am fucking retarded and my smooth brain needs lots of lines but ill try to make it easy to understand technical breakdown on the 20 day chart we can see that gme is going up in a stairstep pattern which is obviously extremely bullish a stairstep pattern is where it rises up consolidates lightly then uses the previous resistance as support for the next stairstep we are currently in a consolidation phase of that stairstep as you can see the red lines that i circled were previously resisstance but are now support this is bullish ampx200b httpspreviewredditsacw2jztcum61pngwidth2218ampformatpngampautowebpamps9ee1373bb21434559cf835cd9cc96e27d3151c9b next and probably one of my favorite things is the fact that on the day we went from 348 all the way down to 180 we had strong support at the 180 level which as i said above was the resistance from the first step which is now our support even better is the fact that our current consolidation is forming a pennant pattern from that support a pennant pattern usually indicates that a stock will continue its trend in this case up this is extremely bullish dare i say apeish the orange lines show the pennant pattern that im talking about and the two circles show the high and low of that pattern lmao also kinda looks like a torpedo cock and balls its important to note that although the chart makes it appear that it will be breaking that pattern soon the pennant could just extend so do not think that its going to break the pattern on monday because though it very well could it could also just continue consolidating ampx200b httpspreviewreddit5q6m693wcum61pngwidth2222ampformatpngampautowebpampsf323375e4cbe77a09f904504c074dadee2823c5a when it finally stops consolidating and breaks this pattern to continue rising the green line above should act as support for our next stair step which would put us at 350ish for support which is huge for the 90 day chart you can see that a few weeks ago we broke the giant triangle pattern which is how we got into the current bullish movement those lines are yellow ampx200b httpspreviewreddit7gwk7ocxcum61pngwidth1586ampformatpngampautowebpamps1955427bbbc72fb02af1766c5a04ec80403e2960 finally in the chart above i have marked the areas of crucial resistance these are the fat green yellow and red lines i made them those colors because each one that we break is more crucial than the previous one because of the last squeeze what to take away from the chart action we are currently in a consolidation period of a stairstep pattern that has happened because we broke the triangle pattern that we started after the price went down from the last squeeze this is very bullish apeish again i apologize for all the lines im a technical trader and i make a shit ton of support and resistance lines for my smooth brain volume everyone is talking about the squeeze shorts and price action and blah blah but the thing that everyone needs to be talking about is volume volume volume volume the only way that any type of squeeze can happen is volume i know that people dont like the vw comparison and im not comparing them here just using this as an example but the squeeze was only able to happen because of tremendous volume ampx200b httpspreviewredditiiet237zcum61pngwidth1280ampformatpngampautowebpamps82223652adfe00a84ee32197351b72cef79b9785 as far as gmes current volume we are not there but dont get down on it becuase we will be the only way for shorts to be squeezed is for a major influx of volume to drive the price up significantly forcing them to cover in the previous squeeze volume spiked tremendously and would have continued to increase if brokerages wouldnt have cut off buying the ceo of interactive brokers even said that the price would reach over 1k if they didnt shut of buying why volume so for gmes volume its plain and simple it needs to increase but i will not that the fact that the price is increasing so much without massive volume is even more bullish apeish but hank how does volume increase excellent question tard brain for gme and most stocks but especially gme catalysts are what drives volume up below is a picture of gmes volume since the january action ampx200b httpspreviewredditrcu25cl0dum61pngwidth1088ampformatpngampautowebpamps2d90f2c7ba53929f73b6dfbc02d2b9f23f84c7a2 the first spike in volume was in late november when ryan cohen announced his stake but the jump wasnt super significant the first big spike that you can see is on january 1113ish when they announced that ryan cohen was being added to the board in the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention the next jump in volume lots of red is when andrew left of shitron had his weeklong downsyndrome tantrum about gme and get his cheeks clapped by wsb this giant volume orgy is continued for the next few days when elon tweets gamestonk chamath buys a bunch of calls and other celebrities like mark cuban voice their support we then see volume teeter off because of the brokerage cucks ass ramming us the next spike in volume corresponds to when gme ousted their cfo many thought that ryan cohen led this we then see volume decrease a little volume the picks back up when gme announces that it has appointed cohen as the head of their committee on changing gme to a digital company volume has since gone down a little but the price has gone up erection what to take from this plain and simple volume is king volume is your wifes boyfriends wifes boyfriends bosss wifes boyfriend we cannot have another squeeze without volume but volume especially in gmes case is greatly correlated with catalysts volume catalysts here are some potential volume catalysts that could lead to the massive spike that we need gme appointing a new cfo gme appointing ryan cohen as ceo better than expected earnings an acquisition supportinvestment from big names ie cuban elon burry etc new committeesinitiativesanything relating to their digital transformation quadruple witching day march 19th still not sure how i feel about this and definitely dont think its the be all end all that many others do but it could certainly help overall it appears that the best catalysts are ones dealing with ryan cohen and digital transformation personally i think that if during their earnings call cohen announces hes gonna be ceo or announces some big digital move that will give us the volume we need its important to note that it appears that ryan cohen wants this to happen and why wouldnt he his net worth is tied to it as evident by the tweets that hes put out that though cryptic seem to be implying support of wsb and hatred of shorts roaring kitty has also been very cryptic lately and it appears that he thinks something big is coming too this is just speculation tho im tard ttm squeeze and macd two of my favorite indicators are macd and ttm squeeze i dont wanna explain them here because i only have so many chromosomes available to me each day but they essentially indicate momentum on my charts i combine the macd lines with the ttm squeeze because they move similarly and i think that ttm is superior to macds histogram as you can see on the 1year chart the macd is in a very bullish pattern right now what im more excited about is the ttm squeeze the colorful bars in a ttm squeeze indicator the light blue lines indicate that the price has extremely bullish momentum its in relation to bollinger bands and keltner channels when the bars turn dark blue there is still bullish momentum but its fading the red bars indicate bearish momentum and the yellow bars indicate fading bearish momentum as you can see are currently in some very strong light blue bars for a ttm squeeze there are usually 710 light blue bars in an extremely bullish pattern from the last squeeze you can see that there are like 5 really tiny light blue bars and then like 3 bigger ones this indicates that we are currently in the middle ofapproaching giant price action but also that the current price action is better than last time and is forming a more stable high arching uptrend if youre thinking oh man unlce hank weve already had 5 light blue bars the squeeze is almost over not so fast tard though i said that theres usually 710 of these bars in an uptrend thats not always the case and going to dark blue bars simply may mean that we are consolidating and will go back to light blue bars overall all this should show you is that yes we are in a bullish trend and things are looking perfect this is one of my favorite indicators and i believe that its giving us insanely good signs ampx200b httpspreviewreddit4jopywl2dum61pngwidth1318ampformatpngampautowebpamps3ac7c78bc7fcea8092f966f5a73c8fb5017f2ece a note about squeezes let me be clear if the brokerages wouldnt have cut off buying this would have gone up past $1000 ib ceo said this and hes a boomercuck because of this last time was not a short squeeze it was a gamma squeeze or a series of them a short squeeze would have resulted in a parabolic move to the upside accompanied by a parabolic jump in volume both the price and volume would look like very tall and skinny triangles see the volkswagen pattern for this a short squeeze does not happen over time it happens suddenly and very violently to the upside gamma squeezes on the other hand can happen over a period of time and can happen in small or big chunks its important to note that gamma squeezes can cause short squeezes and short squeezes can exacerbate game squeezes its a feedback loop which is why its so dangerous so currently i think that we are in the middle of a series of gamma squeezes that could lead to a short squeeze if there is a catalyst that creates volume shorts a lot of numbers have been floating around about short interest some say its 13 27 40 50 60 120 and well above 200 ive even seen 900 imo its impossible to know right now finras release said it was about 50 and thats the one that i believe to be the most likely definitely dont believe finras 27 assplay however its important to note that those 100 numbers very well could be correct the reason for this is because they cant take into consideration naked shorts if you dont know about this there are 100s of dds about it so imo there are 2 scenarios here 1 its literally just 50ish short interest on gme let me be clear this is still huge anything above 30 is huge so 50 is still amazing and has massive short squeeze potential for gme 2 its actually above 200 if the latter is true then the squeeze will 100 happen and will also probably crash the financial system because as we know from 2008 when institutions get into these shady unregulated derivative bets on volatile things it usually creates a collateral effect personally i have no clue which one is correct the latter obviously sounds like a conspiracy but could very well be true because we all know how shady these funds are however it begs the question why are they still doing this the answer to this is they are either retarded and not in a good way doing it out of anger and spite and we all know how well emotional trading goes or they are in a bind and cant get out of it personally i think that the conspiracy about naked shorts and everything is either extremely false or extremely true if its extremely true then hfs are just kicking the can down the road hoping that we lose interest and the price decreases if its false then we still have 50 short interest apes and daddy cohen tldr on this paragraph short numbers are conflicting and its impossible to know which is correct or if the naked short theory is true either way i like the stock closing thots the most important thing as i said is fucking volume this is not just gonna magically happen sure the price could very well keep increasing over the coming daysweeks on low volume and small gamma squeezes could happen but until we get a surge in volume through a catalyst we are not going to see the short squeeze remember the squeeze has not squoze until there is a parabolic move in price and volume over a very short period of time im talking trading getting halted 5 times in a single day on the upside do i think that these next few weeks are going to be very important yes especially next week and earnings week but do i think its over if not fuck no so with that being said please try to avoid talking about dates as a certainty because it could lead to some of the younger tards selling because theyre disappointed make sure to do what rensole does and say that it could happen that its a possibility not that its the endgame or a certainty finally continued talk about gme continued buying and holding and continued retardation are key this is not

overnight it always gives me the hangover of loss it always ends the same my account is in disarray i feel a sense of hopelessness and everything in my life id worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like stimulus checks set to arrive but this timethis time it really could be different the fomc is coming up this week starting march 16th for the unitiated this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on the fed gives their guidance in matters including—but not limited toquantitive easing interest rate speculation and bond yield curve controlhttpswwwgooglecomampsthinkingcomamparticleuswhattowatchatthemarchfedmeeting market volatility precedes it as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa pow might or might not say or do—if the man farted into the microphone and walked away vxx would probably climb 15the tension is palpable this one couldn’t come at a more precarious time as good news is now bad news as reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus people are beginning to stop taking jpow at his word he promises a steady hand he promises no interest rate increases he says bond yield curve control is always on the tableand yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll you see the problem with the fed right now is no matter what they say investors see the inevitable trend theyre betting there is only so long the fed can continue to artificially support the marketand only so long there will be reason to as indexes roar the actual economy improves and vaccine distribution is for the most part on track to return us to a world of pseudonormalcy by summer it doesnt help that the fed stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on yield curves definitively during speaking engagements and quietly ended the term repo m lending programhttpswwwbloombergcomnewsarticles20210127fedendingtermreposreflectsliquidityfeastfordealers my choice here is between treasurytickers and the vxx last time i was making this choice i went with vxx on the dd and that choice didnt pan out until the second week i said then reflecting on that week’s losers that i should have chosen treasuriesso why didn’t i this time with the opportunity right here vxx is just absurdly low right now trading under $14 im not saying the pop will happen tuesday or wednesday but it may and dollars to donuts if you hold a vxx 14 or 1450c 41 youll make some money at some point if you dont hold too long after it makes a run also if jerome breathes a word about yield control they will plummett this intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low—there is too much potential for chop sure i could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people’s accounts and that argument is fair as i see some of the new age commodities mooning to ath over the wekend but for the most part id rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks dont come back burning me but anyway you didn’t come here for my halfbaked philosophy on impending market volatility you came cuz you heard we got them baggers so lets talk whales shoutout to unusual whales who makes this possible through letting me share their pick info they’re great last week’s lovers dkng absolutely crushed it tier 2 on a sustained measurement over the week actually defeated tier 1 ocgn sq ebay all had magnificent moments in the sun aided by that crazy 4 nasdaq day midweek pivot the f call midweek was clutch on the 13c and now its sitting above that price to end the week also i know yall were feeling the heat on that t midweek pivot call but friday brought us the glory i was sweating though 😅 last week’s lesson ge and dis were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on monday then they hit us with that nasty curve news broke that ge was closing a huge deal on sunday which gave me continued optimism and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse splitif you say you saw that coming yous a damn lie dis got great news but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number is that ta i dont know man i think so and couldnt hold i think the key here is it’s okay to take a pause on the pick if it’s hot fresh out the gate the week of the rambo there will be more picks the other lesson here is that when the event is big enough it plays like an earnings rather than a pump dkng for example had pump written all

m4j5s5,none,n/a,how the united states government could benefit from meme stocks going to the moon,discussion,20,0.89,fortifier22,21,disclaimer none of this is financial advise or 100 based on facts this is simply educational and theoretical discussion tldr capital gains tax easing and even erasing debt financial stimulus to peoples all over the world a happier and more compliant population tax dodgers and those who screwed over the world in 2008 brought to justice in the only way that matters and a much needed stock market correction that could prevent a future disaster we all know that many meme stocks theoretically have the potential to explode through short and gamma squeezes and that will make many shareholders on the long side a lot of money however when looking at the bigger picture there is a lot that the government could gain from such events that can help them and the country in a long run lets take a look at the aftermath of meme stocks mooning 1 capital gains tax when people sell their meme stock shares after short squeezes occur governments will attain taxes off these investments considering that millions of shares will be traded frequently for large sums of money that will bring some much needed stimulus to the economy this is especially considering how 40 of americas money has been printed in the last year due to covid19 instead of raising taxes on the american people and having them pay more for their own money in the long run the capital gains taxes from these stocks can potentially make that unnecessary also with more money gained from stocks many will likely reinvest some or even most of their money back into the stock market leading to even more capital gains taxes being reaped 2 people being more willing and able to spend further stimulating the economy and creating a happier population its no surprise that when times are tougher economically people tend to spend less and save more yet because this leads to governments reaping less taxes and businesses not being as profitable this makes economic times rougher which in turn leads to a potentially endless economic recessiondepression weve seen this in japan in the late 1990s and early 2000s and they are currently at economic levels that are equal to their status in 1980 theyve gone backwards in terms of their financial progression with the general population in possession of large sums of money however this allows the economy to be stimulated which not only benefits many people from nearly all classes but also creates a happier population overall imagine it after a year of prolonged quarantine job loss future inflation and economic instability all while billionaires and institutions are playing the system and becoming even more rich for their own sakes suddenly get served justice then their money gets divided among those who took the most risks and played against them fought the fight to the end and helped make the world a better place this is practically the script to endgame heck most actionheroic movies and the american people get to be a part of it speaking of bad guys 3 the gains also wont be in the hands of large tax dodgers we all know that tax dodging is practiced by many especially those in large positions of power and wealth so is it truly wrong to reasonably assume that many big wall street players are dodging taxes for the us government this means that a lot of money that should and could be going towards erasing national debt fortifying infrastructure improving medical and educational institutions and many more benefits for americans overall is instead being kept away for the sake of keeping rich individuals bank accounts filled with zeros with the money in the hands of the average citizen however the vast majority will not be able to commit tax fraud if at all on a massive level of course they wont go out quietly when the squeezes happen yet that can still be a good thing because 4 the stock market needs a correction many have been speculating that the stock market is not accurately reflecting the american economy and that a correction is inevitable when the squeezes happen for meme stocks however after the new dtcc rule comes into effect that will force hedge funds to liquidate much of their assets to cover their positions theyll likely sell their other shares in massive volumes causing huge dips to occur in many stocks across the stock market yet once the dust settles people can finally reassess the markets and determine where everything should be stocks that deserve to be higher will be on huge discounts for many investors to get in on and allow them to go back up again while those that deserve to be down will likely stay down then the economy can become stabilized again and everything can continue as it should whether all of this is correct or not is beyond me and only based on the information i currently know theres far more that could and could not happen based on ifwhen meme stocks skyrocket and force many shorters and market makers to buy stocks at higher prices but most importantly i wanted to start a potential discussion on the aftermath of meme stocks going to the moon and allow others to also and and correct my statements as well as share this info with the overall community so what do you

people try to make a stupid persons guide to how options work and being really irresponsible about explaining theta i have a few points i want to make about theta then hopefully we can put this to rest im not going to talk about delta or iv thats a different conversation and motherfuckers need to read real quick not a pro not investment advice advice about how you need to actually learn shit if youre too retarded to understand basic math or youre too lazy to try to actually better yourself then click the back button now for the retards that stick around ill include pictures and a fun little story okay about 3 of you should be left so lets dive in theta the term theta refers to the rate of decline in the valuehttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsvvalueasp of an option due to the passage of time it can also be referred to as the time decayhttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsttimedecayasp of an option this means an option loses value as time moves closer to its maturityhttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsmmaturitydateasp as long as everything is held constant theta is generally expressed as a negative number and can be thought of as the amount by which an options value declines every day theta is an estimate of value decay its a rate thats continuously adjusted every second that passes makes your option worth less and less the biggest misconception is the one i want to focus on the most we talk about it it terms expressed in decay on a day i think for our simple brains but its not that simple just like days arent really exactly 24 hours and theres complex reasons why theta is not linear you dickheads remember ymxb from middle school thats linear heres theta on an option graphed for a 1yr contract ampx200b

option accelerates over time look at that last little sliver of the chart see how sharp it goes down thats fd range thats when all the value of the option evaporates nearly instantly like your wifes interest in you when she met her boyfriend ampx200b

c250 fd on gme that i had to close on a loss even though it was itm why because the rate of decay on the option was so fast that gme wasnt rising fast enough to increase the value of the option and make up the difference buying otm and going itm is good but its important to understand that even if you are itm it still wont save you from theta and sometimes its smarter to take profit rather than waiting you could even take the profit and buy the underlying retardape edition incase youre somehow still here you live in loserville and want to move to tendietown the distance is 1000 miles you have 1 work week to get there 5 days so first thing you realize is that you can travel 200 miles per day and youll get there on time great say you take monday off suddenly you need to travel 250 miles per day not impossible but okay thats not a fun speed to move at take note its a 25 increase lets say again on the second day theres no movement now you need to cover the same 1000 miles in 3 days okay now youre looking at 3333 miles thats a 3333 increase from the previous day holy shit now you need to fucking move and move fast but lets say for one reason or another you gary michael edward cant get out of bed on wednesday still have 1000 miles to travel now you need to cover that distance in 2 days with an average velocity toward your goal at 500 miles per day thats a 50 increase from the previous day and on the last day you need to do all 1000 which is a 100 increase from the previous day this is a gross over simplification but it at least gets point across do you guys get it now every day without progress makes the goal much more unlikely because the burden just shifts and grows exponentially to the remainder of time as the likelihood of the open hitting itm increases and time passes theta acts as a decaying agent on the price bringing it into balance please stop reading option tutorials from plumbers dog walkers high school teachers please read about these concepts on actual investing websites and not the worlds instagram of trading addiction or watch video from actual professional investors if someone tells you theyre not a pro are retarded think twice about letting them explain shit to you read a book motherfucker fds made this casino notorious because people who were here well before i was started posting crazy yolo fds who knew how acidic theta was and still bought and occasionally made disgusting returns good luck everyone i know all you are going to pump fds with your stimmy so i guess just have fun and please try to learn how to

m5w89m,apha,0.55%,cannabis dd why 💩trulieve💩 will suffer from marijuana reform apha 🚀🚀,dd,8,0.83,overwatchnweed,67,as a cannabis investor one of my favorite debates to jump in or read is the msos vs lps however those discussions are usually way too vague and should be comparing the top companies at the very least instead of a general us vs canada lets talk about trulieve and aphria mostly trulieve multi state operator mso us companies licensed producers lp canadian companies trulieves success is literally a house of cards and i personally will enjoy watching it fall florida is one of the most restricted and monopolized cannabis markets in the us over 80 of the market is controlled by 5 companies including trulieve this kind of market is exactly what our politicians pushing reform do not want this is not my opinion this is easily concluded with social justice and social equity being at the forefront of legalization it is the politicians intent to offer opportunities to minorities and communities hurt by marijuana prohibition and tax the fuck out of them on the back end i think its more likely these opportunities come on the retail side not the production side trulieve has over 70 stores across florida and they are all vertically integrated i know you already know what that means but just in case they sell their our products and only their own products its a great business model of course but its all going to come crashing down for them and msos like them lets think about what a legal market does to a company like trulieve as of a 2020 study florida had 11 dispensaries per 100k persons states like oregon with legal marijuana or oklahoma with a relaxed medical program each have over 15 dispensaries to every 100k persons considering florida is the 3rd most populated state i dont think its unreasonable to expect similar ratios for dispensaries per 100k if not higher this would mean 15x more competition at least literally even 30 less dispensaries per 100k than an average open market would be 10 to 1 or 10x more competition whats the bull thesis for trulieve holding 50 market share in an open market like they do now in a monopolized market lol also as ive said before they are currently vertically integrated and sell their own products exclusively this will not last for many different reasons so they will see massive amounts of new stores opening around them as well as having to stock their shelves for the first time with other brands they will be losing daily customers in droves and even the customers they do get in the door will be buying other products not made by trulieve which is going to hurt their margins and the bottom line hard then they will start to see an excess of marijuana as they struggle to distribute their over 1m sqft of grow space if they lose even just 30 of their shelf space to competition low estimate they would lose 30 of shelf space across ever location they own thats going to add up and stockpile quickly this is where a genius thinks they will just sell their product into other stores okay youre right there but only to a certain degree first off i dont see companies who maintained a monopoly being welcomed warmly into a legal market its pretty easy to conclude more people will approach trulieve with a grudge rather than a chubbie also how many trulievers will there be when hundreds of new brands are introduced meanwhile apha is already selling weed beer to 23 states and all delta airlines flights hosts the largest 420 festival in atlanta and busy tackling a global cannabis market while they wait for the us to open literally building a monopoly in the eu obviously the us is the crown jewel but even curaleafs ceo sees more opportunities in europe than the us in the coming years so while trulieve spends millions on stores in a single state apha is spending millions building a global cannabis conglomerate these two stocks are not built the same by the way to be clear i think lps like aphatlry cron cgc and even ogi are in a better position than msos like tru high tide and any other retail heavy or monopoly focused companies its the msos ready for the next green wave lt who have 2 year supply agreements with the largest brands in cannabis cookies in the largest markets california and msos with proven success as cpg businesses in crowded markets ffnt who should be getting more attention not companies who suffer from legalization like tru and sspk weedmaps is just a complicated google search lol stores will operate their own online websites with online menus and not pay a commission to weedmaps 🤷 im not an expert or anything but i feel like people are saying they are investing in upcoming change but make decisions based on the market now the market youre investing for and the market that exists have very little in common generally tldr apha 🚀🚀 tru💩💩,2021-03-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5w89m/cannabis_dd_why_trulieve_will_suffer_from/
m5wamk,tlt,-5.56%,whats actually going on with treasuries potential tlt play,dd,5,1.0,greendildosurprise,11,so why have treasuries actually tank recently is the wave of hyperinflation finally coming probably not the recent drop in treasuries was likely just the result of some boring banking regulation exemptions expiring this month back in march 2020 bank deposits and us treasuries were exempt from what is known as the supplementary leverage ratio since this is really hard to explain accurately and briefly and most of you cant read anyway the nutshell version is that slr tells banks they must have a certain amount of capital relative to various assets on their books investments deposits etc in order to ensure a bank can withstand a market downturn why do you care well the slr exemption expires this month which means that both ust and customer deposits will now factor back into this equation at the same time the banks are about to take in a shitload of stimulus money as deposits also the fomc meets tomorrow and will likely be deciding on whether they will extend the slr last time around a lot of democrats were very against these slr exemptions and there is a good chance the slr rule wont be extended due to political factors regardless of economicfinancial factors likely banks having been dumping ust to come into compliance with regulations after this exemption expires additionally whether the fed will implement some type of yield curve control will likely be decided at this meeting well be hearing about that on 317 which means theres likely to be heavy volatility in treasuries this week if the slr exemption is extended or the fed announces some type of ycc we might see treasuries eaten up at the end of the week if they announce neither we might see another dump i honestly have no idea which way it will go but the volatility on tlt is low enough that i dont see any reason you cant play both sides ps because the mods have decided to put filters in i can post but cant reply to your comments until i whore myself for more comment karma so ill try to pm you if you leave a decent question positions 319 1355p138c,2021-03-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5wamk/whats_actually_going_on_with_treasuries_potential/
m5wglc,gme,-28.92%,gme trading strategy to catalyze the squeeze,dd,21,0.96,ajdillonsmiddleleg,290,i made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on gme and several people asked that i turn that comment into a post so here it is obviously im going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze first the comment as it was ive seen lots of bullish ta on gme keep in mind all ta requires volume to play out how it should we havent had any volume on gme in over a week holding shares simply isnt enough needs constant all day every single day buying of shares and in the money options if you buy options that are 2030 in the money they literally cant price pin because they cant get and keep the price 2030 below current market so you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge and virtually eliminate their means of counterattack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain price at which most contracts expire worthless if you are intending to help push the squeeze buy shares throughout the day every day if you are playing options mostly buy calls in the money if youre buying otm calls buy as close to current price as you can afford the more imbalanced otm calls are the more theyre just going to price pin at maximum pain they literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new itm call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge essentially we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with gamestop there are two major reasons 1 manipulation we cannot do anything about this really aside from buy and hold technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels the shorts while stuck in a stupid position arent stupid they know when the ta is indicating a bullish setup and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup 2 volume all technical setups require volume to play out if volume doesnt follow the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable except in this case it goes down because its being shorted at every chance so what do we need to do hold yes but that cant be it if we are doing nothing but holding this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient they can literally hold us in a stalemate for monthsyears if volume never shows up to move the price yes they pay more interest the longer they have to wait theyll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the sec steps in to stop market manipulation volume without volume there is no endgame look at every day weve had spikes look at the volume now look at the past week or two we arent making progress because nobody is buying shares aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks believe it or not the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze the whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time if it catches on they can follow it up but if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail this thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days if you look at any day there are surges in buy volume but theyre short thats likely a whale testing the market if they see confirmationfollowup from the market its less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure so it will be something like whale buy retail confirmation buys whale buy runaway effect gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze all of those things have to happen consecutively fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack now this is going to sound counterintuitive but in order to catalyze the squeeze we have to stop just buying the dip when volume picks up and the price is spiking thats the most important time to buy thats the point when additional buying pressure is most important and until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes we are going to keep bouncing back and forth options the other side of the coin is options purchases stop devoting the majority of your capital to far otm lotto tickets this helps the short positions because it forces the market makers to help the shorts market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk when you buy an $800c it does two things 1 they dont have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral 2 in incentivizes the market makers to pin the price you can do some additional reading on max pain price in options but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless when you buy otm call options youre increasing the maximum pain price which makes it easier for market makers and shorts to pin the price there if however youre buying a ton of itm call options youre doing two things 1 deep itm calls have a delta of essentially 100 this means that in order to remain risk neutral the market makers essentially has to buy 100 shares immediately upon selling you the contract 2 it lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most oi this means in order to pin the price at max pain they would need to drop it from its current price not only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately meaning they dont care where the price goes you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price if you must buy otm calls buy ones that are at least closer to being itm the further otm you buy calls the more likely the price will go sideways you can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases once it achieves a runaway squeeze which will be easy to identify you can start buying your lotto tickets tldr in my opinion if you want to help catalyze the squeeze you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least 1020 in the money 💎🙌🚀🌖,2021-03-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5wglc/gme_trading_strategy_to_catalyze_the_squeeze/

$enph and after the success of that investment sub $2 share price in 2018 now trading above $150 a share i was looking to invest in a company with a similarly checkered past with a catalyst to turn the corner quickly as with $enph the company needed to have invaluable technology with the potential for huge nearterm gains to compensate for the risk i couldn’t have been more elated discovering $amrs which checked all the boxes $amrs has performed well this year so far but we are lightyears away from the company’s potential both over the short and long term $amrs business this business is complicated but i’ll do my best to summarize some key points founded by a group of berkley scientists $amrs is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers manufactures and sells sustainably created ingredients and products into several markets including health amp wellness clean beauty and flavor amp fragrance within health amp wellness $amrs focuses on alternative sweeteners vitamins and food ingredients in flavor amp fragrance $amrs produces natural oils and aroma chemicals for a range of applications in clean beauty $amrs focuses on clean skincare and cosmetic ingredients for all you tree huggers their production and products are totally sustainable and by creating otherwise naturally occurring molecules in the lab $amrs saves the destruction of animals and other natural resources as an example they produce a skincare molecule called squalene that otherwise requires killing sharks to get it $amrs generates revenue from a combination of a partnership model and a whollyowned direct model in the partnership model $amrs creates a moleculeingredient in the lab and scales it on a commercial level on behalf of a partner who then uses the moleculeingredient in one of its products which the partner markets and sells to its own customers $amrs captures revenues from producing and selling the moleculeingredient to the partner $amrs receives royalties from the partner’s product sales that contain the ingredient created by $amrs $amrs has many commercial industrial level partners including firmenich givaudan dsm yifan the us department of energy and darpa on

volume of just 49 million shares and just 23 million shares traded last friday 326 i suspect that when the company delivers on its upcoming transactions this week trading volumes will increase from

began discussing a series of three upcoming strategic transactions that have truly changed the game for the company each transaction is different but effectively involve the monetization of a moleculeingredient whereby a partner pays $amrs a significant upfront cash payment as well as licensing fees royalties over a multiyear period the significance of these transactions cannot be understated as they provide cash to the business while creating recurring revenue streams in effect these deals allow $amrs to selffund its business without diluting existing investors from new equity offerings or extremely expensive debt this is what the market has been craving the first of the three closed last december with a transaction value of just $50 millionhttpsinvestorsamyriscom20201221amyriscloses50millionstrategictransaction and the stock has flying ever since gaining over 200 so far this year the remaining two transactions are set to close

company has almost no intuitional coverage and is paid very little attention relative to more established biotechnology companies said differently the institutions that really set valuation and move the stock dont care enough yet to pay attention but they will $amrss investor base only continues to expand as more people wake up to its incredible potential second prior to the recent turnaround the company overpromised a few times just as companies that later mooned like $enph did it happens particularly with early stage companies so even in the efficient market fantasy world the companys public disclosures would have a credibility discount leaving substantial upside for investors today when the company inevitably delivers conclusion these strategic transactions will announce by no later than
