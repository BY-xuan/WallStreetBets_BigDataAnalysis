mk4pod,PAVE,-0.39%,An investment that will benefit from the infrastructure bill Check out PAVE ETF,Discussion,30,0.86,ralphsdiorama,25,If you are looking for an infrastructure investment look not further than PAVE ETF It‚Äôs holdings are well diversified across the physical digital and energy infrastructure found in the bill And options are still very cheap at the moment  Here is everything you need to know about the etf from seeking alpha  The Global X US Infrastructure Development ETF PAVE is in an excellent position to directly benefit from President Bidens American Jobs Plan that was announced on Wednesday in Pittsburgh PA The proposed plan targets over 14 trillion for direct investments into physical infrastructure including transportation schools hospitals and buildings as well as for energy water and digital infrastructure The PAVE ETF holds many of the companies that will provide the materials tools services and components required for this infrastructure buildout and should handsomely benefit from it  INVESTMENT RATIONALE  President Biden presented the American Jobs Plan part of his build back better initiative on Wednesday in Pittsburgh and the White House published a FACT SHEET on its website In a nutshell a broad summary of the infrastructure initiatives in the American Jobs Plan is shown below  PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE   Transportation infrastructure 621B  Buildings schools and hospitals 250B  Infrastructure resilience 50B  ENERGY WATER AND DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE   Cleantech clean energy and related infra 300B  Water Utilities 111B  Digital infrastructure 100b  In total the aggregate spending targeted directly at these infrastructure projects is over 14 trillion The investment thesis here is simple find an infrastructure fund that can benefit directly from those investment dollars  Lets take a look at the PAVE ETF and see what its prospects are going forward  TOP HOLDINGS  The PAVE Infrastructure Development ETFs Top10 holdings can be found on Global X ETF website and equate to roughly 30 of what I would characterize as a moderately concentrated portfolio that holds a total of 101 companies  PAVE has 23 billion in assets so even a 32 weight of 1 holding Deere DE results in a 805 million stake Many investors would consider Deere and odd choice for an infrastructure ETF considering it is generally regarded as focused solely on agriculture However DE operates in three segments  one of which is its Construction amp Forestry Segment This segment manufactures machines for earth moving road building graders excavators material handling crushers and screeners and asphalt pavers DE is up 178 over the past year yet has an estimated forward PE of only 233x  The 2 holding with a 30 weight is motion control systems specialist ParkerHannifin Corp PH which operates a Diversified Industrial segment that provides sealing shielding vibration and thermal solutions as well as filters noise abatement and contaminate removal systems for water air fuel oil and other liquids PH is also up 170 over the past year has a forward PE224x and yields 11  The Eaton Corp ETN is the 3 holding and has 30 weight within the portfolio Eaton pays a 304 annual dividend yields 22 and has a forward PE249x The company is heavily involved in the power management sector and likely will provide many of the electrical components and assemblies needed to build out the electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure detailed in the American Jobs Plans investments into Clean Tech and Clean Energy  The 4 5 and 10 holdings are railroad companies Norfolk Southern NSC Kansas City Southern KSU and CSX Corp CSX Along with 12 holding Union Pacific UNP these four holdings alone equate to 115 of the entire portfolio Obviously this ETF is betting that these rail freight providers will be hauling much of the gravel rock asphalt lumber steel and products and assemblies that will be needed to build out the infrastructure of roads bridges buildings and energy and water systems as detailed in the AJP These railroads will also benefit from opening up and a generally stronger economy  Some of that has been fueled by the excellent progress the Biden administration and bigpharma when it comes to the vaccine rollout and as a result from general expectations that the US economy is opening up fast and will see very strong growth in the 2H of the year Meantime Canadian Pacific CP recently offered to buy KSU for 25 billion which has added some merger mania to the sector  Surprisingly the fund does not hold Caterpillar CAT CAT is generally thought to be one of the main beneficiaries of an infrastructure bill But considering that stock has doubled over the past year perhaps the management team feels it is overvalued But with a forward PE283x and a 18 yield CAT seems to be an odd omission in my opinion  Looking through the rest of the portfolio see the full list of holdings here we find many of the companies that sell the raw materials steel aluminum copper lumber asphalt filters etc needed to for as the basic building blocks for transportation electrical utility and water infrastructure  PERFORMANCE  PAVE ETF wins by a considerable margin over IFRA on a NAV basis and neither ETF pays that much in the way of income 064 and 14 respectively PAVE is 9x the size of IFRA which has 250 million in AUM  Over a shorter timeframe that encompasses the yearofcovid19 and the period when discussions about an infrastructure bill to get Americans back to work with goodpaying jobs got serious PAVE has also outperformed the IFRA ETF by a significant margin  FUND BASICS  These metrics all come from the Global X PAVE ETF Webpage  Expense Ratio 047 AUM 23 billion PE Ratio 322x Forward PE Ratio 219x PricetoBook 36x 30day SECyield 064 Roughly 87 of the fund is invested in the Industrials and Materials sectors  RISKS  Considering the strong rally the PAVE ETF has had over the past year in anticipation of the infrastructure bill much has already been built into the price That said note the fund is not overweight any highflying cleanenergy names and despite the growth of some of these stocks many still sell at very reasonable valuation levels  see the forward PEs of some of the top holding discussed earlier  The biggest risk is getting a substantial the American Jobs Plan through Congress It should get through the Democratically controlled House in roughly the same shape as presented As we learned with the American Rescue Plan despite the objections of some of the more progressive members of the Democratic Party they have shown some level of pragmatism in that they know if the legislation doesnt get through the very narrowly controlled Senate it wont matter what they pass in the House Much is likely to depend on what Senator Joe Manchin DWest Virginia decides he will support as if history is any indication the AJP will get zero Republicans votes so the Democrats must get all 50votes so that Vice President Harris can break the tie  I believe the Democrats will push the legislation through because a recent poll by Navigator recently found broad bipartisan support over 80 for an infrastructure bill by American voters  TLDR Summary amp Conclusion  For those investors that dont typically invest in the infrastructure sector myself included but want to have some exposure to where their tax dollars are going in the American Jobs Plan the PAVE ETF seems like an excellent choice The portfolio is full of solidly profitable companies that are reasonably valued and in an excellent position to benefit from the buildout of US infrastructure PAVE is a BUY,2021-04-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mk4pod/an_investment_that_will_benefit_from_the/
mk5h3m,None,N/A,The US Govt has a huge incentive to massively underreport inflation,Discussion,171,0.93,Natural_Profession_8,198,TLDR The US federal government has a massive incentive to underreport inflation A 1 underreporting of inflation saves the US govt between 500 billion and 1 trillion per year Its likely that such a huge moral hazard has led the government to systematically underreport inflation over the past few decades  For background the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS calculates inflation It releases a measure known as the Consumer Price Index or CPI The formula used to calculate CPI is rather complex and opaque and has been changed numerous times over the years The effect of these changes has been to lower the average reported inflation number 1httpswwwinvestopediacomarticles07consumerpriceindexasp  Many government revenues and expenditures are inflationlinked either directly or indirectly  Directly linked  1 Social security payments  Social security payments are linked to a measure known as CPIW very similar to the CPI 2httpswwwssagovoactCOLAcolasummaryhtml Every year the amount a social security recipient receives goes up in proportion to the amount of inflation It has been estimated that the social security program has total unfunded liabilities worth 37 trillion Every 1 of underreported inflation decreases the real value of these unfunded liabilities by 370 billion  2 Tax brackets  Tax brackets are adjusted upwards to account for inflation 3httpswwwinvestopediacomaskanswers111715aretaxbracketsadjustedinflationasp This means when the government underreports inflation more people move up into higher tax brackets Its hard to calculate the exact effect of this on government revenues  3 Treasury InflationProtected Securities  These are treasuries that increase the amount they pay back in both interest and principle according to inflation They are linked to the CPI These securities known as TIPS compromise 8 of the US federal debt 4httpswwwtreasurygovresourcecenterfinmktsPagestipsaspx This is 224 trillion Every 1 of underreported inflation decrease the real value of the principle of this debt by 22 billion There are also increases to the interest payments on this debt  Indirectly linked  1 Debt interest payments  Investors will demand higher returns from Treasuries in periods where they expect higher inflation The US government has 26 trillion in Treasury debt The yearly cost of servicing this debt is 12 of that roughly 378 billion in 2020 If investors were to expect higher inflation this yearly cost would go up by 260 billion for every 1 increase in expected inflation  There are likely many other government programs that benefit from underreporting inflation these are just the main ones I could find When we add up all these policies we see that underreporting inflation by just 1 can save the government between 500 billion and 1 trillion a year This is 30 of the entire tax revenue of the US government Underreporting inflation by 34 a year would save the government more money than it brings in from taxes every year  Evidence of underreporting  There has probably never been a time in history when such a massive moral hazard existed and was not exploited Is there any evidence that the US government has in fact been understating inflation  1 Changes to the CPI formula  Originally the CPI was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods In this case the CPI was a cost of goods index COGI However over time the US Congress embraced the view that the CPI should reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living1Ôªø Consequently the CPI has evolved into a cost of living index COLI  Over the years the methodology used to calculate the CPI has undergone numerous revisions According to the¬†BLS the changes removed biases that caused the CPI to overstate the inflation rate The new methodology takes into account changes in the quality of goods and substitution Substitution the change in purchases by consumers in response to price changes changes the relative weighting of the goods in the basketÔªø The overall result tends to be a lower CPI However critics view the methodological changes and the switch from a¬†COGI¬†to a COLI as a purposeful manipulation that allows the¬†US¬†government to report a lower CPI 5httpswwwinvestopediacomarticles07consumerpriceindexasp  Essentially the methodology used to calculate the CPI was changed to purposefully reduce the amount of inflation that is reported When a good is considered to be of increased quality its price increase is lowered to reflect this When the price of one good goes up its relative weighting in the CPI is reduced and another lowerpriced good is substituted for it  2 Rent  In 2005 the average US rent was 755 In 2019 it was 1164 6httpswwwdeptofnumberscomrentus This is an increase of 54 or an average yearly increase of 31 During the same time the CPI has gone from 1916 to 2524 7httpsfredstlouisfedorgseriesCPIAUCSL which is only a 31 increase or an average yearly increase of 19 If we use rent as the true measure of inflation CPI has underreported inflation by 11 per year Keep in mind that during the period just mentioned the US experienced the most epic collapse in housing prices it had ever seen during the 20072008 crisis The housing bubble was already far along by 2005 8httpsfredstlouisfedorgseriesCSUSHPISA Nonetheless rent increases managed to outstrip the CPI  What do you think Is the US government massively underreporting

mk65ap,ASO,25.18%,ASO is a powder keg amp will blow soon,DD,42,0.82,Velociraptorsss,81,ASO is Academy sports and outdoors They are a sports equipment store and a hunting store that sells guns amp ammo I would describe them similar to Dicks but more focused on their core selling points they arent spending money making their stores look like a extravegent mall I have been too ASO many times and overall enjoy their store amp from my personal experience they have been consistently busy this past year and the days ammo arrives there is always a line around the building at 7 am of people trying to get some before they sell out   ASO IPOd in October of 2020 ASO is a fundamentally undervalued stock Last week they absolutely smashed earnings by doubling EPS Estimated was 46 and actual was 109 Their revenue increased as well Their net sales increased 18 over last year They have a market cap of 263 B and trade at a PE of 766 as compared to Dicks which trades at a PE of 1385  As you can see this stock is criminally undervalued as compareded to its peers IPO lockup period ended on 331 which caused a negative dip on open that day but the stock finished postive on the day as there was not a mass sell off as shorters of the stock had hoped for    The stock has been shorted from the start because I believe it was just lumped into the typical brick amp mortar category and will just assumed would bleed out due to online shopping This was a grave miscalculation as ASO provides a niche varitey of products that the online space is not fulfiilling adequetly amp their top compeitor Dicks has been backing out of like guns and ammo They have a current short interest of 39 with a public float of 31 M The stock currently is at a all time high of 29 that means every single instution that shorted this stock is negative now and they have 9 days to cover their positions With some more volume and upward pressure in this stock and we could see a squeeze similair to the one that happened with RKT I dont see this stock tripling or anything of the scale that GME had but I do see a substaintial price increase soon if the right factors materialize   Open interest for 416 30 strike calls are huge and if the volume comes in and pushes the stock up we could be looking at quite the squeeze for this bad boy   TLDR ASO is a fundamentally undervalued stock that is currently trading at a ATH with high short interest which makes it prime for a squeeze   Positions 9 416 30 strike amp  2 416 25 strike calls   ampx200B  This is not financial advice spend your money however you choose,2021-04-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mk65ap/aso_is_a_powder_keg_will_blow_soon/
