m2h3yu,None,N/A,This is why the squeeze hasnt even started to begin and that was NOWHERE near the peak,DD,7,0.89,Gum6789,31,I am smooth brained but here is my logic for why the hedges havent covered the squeeze hasnt begun and I am more bullish than ever 1 Even by conservative estimations of how fucked they are 325 peak wouldnt be anywhere close to them being able to cover all their shorts 2 If the price rise was from them covering who the fuck was erecting sell walls Seems very counterintuitive to cuck your own plan if that were the case 3 The CEO of interactive brokers let slip live on air that GME was running into the thousands before buying was halted in January Since then the hedge funds have dug themselves into a much much deeper hole 4 figures is now a very conservative amount per share 4 This is speculation but youd imagine there would be dialogue between the DTCC and Shitadel If they had it under control either they had a convincing means to stop the squeeze or eat the peak then I doubt the DTCC would have been concerned enough to try push through the new rules Shitadel and co Could eat up a 325 peak and not go bankrupt 5 The fuckery and data shows they are petrified of us passing 350400 I think we could be nearing a price where they could be margin called be north of those numbers 6 Why are they still weaponising the media to convince us GME is dead They are DESPERATE for us to know it is over If they had it under control they would just short it down without much fuss to the price they can close their positions at 7 The HFs arent stupid and wouldnt have shorted it so much to get us on the SSR there are definitely big players on our side who know what they are doing 8 I think we were ahead of a lot of peoples price estimates and we still have so many catalysts to come quad witching stimmies Cohen becoming CEO all of these will spike interest and the price Yes the bear trap seemed to come out of nowhere after such a steady rise but diamond hands are formed under pressure and it was never going to be a smooth journey I believe the German market will boost us back up to 280s for a fresh run at 300 today There is plenty of other more technical DD out there and some of mine may be speculative but thought might be worth sharing,2021-03-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2h3yu/this_is_why_the_squeeze_hasnt_even_started_to/
m2h4zy,GME,41.47%,Why the price of GME shares could reach anywhere from 12k to 28k,Discussion,11,0.79,zilliput,124,While reading through comments on WSB this week Ive seen a fair amount of skepticism regarding some popular price targets for GME This post is an attempt to bring some context to some of these price targets Consider the fact that even if GameStops market capitalization briefly reaches 2T it still will not be the most valuable company in the world that title will remain with Apple At a market cap of 2T shares of GME will be worth 28680 At a share price of 10k GameStops market capitalization will be 700B less than those of companies such as Alibaba Tencent Facebook Alphabet Amazon Microsoft and Apple Now from the perspective of fundamentals it doesnt make sense to compare GameStops market cap to those of the companies just mentioned However in the context of a short squeeze it seems like a reasonable comparison especially in light of any evidence supporting the possibility that GameStop will briefly become the most valuable company in the world And that possibility is quite plausible Remember that Volkswagen became the most valuable company in the world when the price of its shares spiked in the midst of a short squeeze in 2008 You might say Well maybe market caps were more uniformly distributed in 2008 so the bar for VW was lower Ok fair point But at the peak of the VW short squeeze VW attained a market cap of 420B According to The World Bank see httpsdataworldbankorgindicatorCMMKTLCAPCDhttpsdataworldbankorgindicatorCMMKTLCAPCD the total market cap of all listed domestic companies worldwide was 3227T in 2008 and 6865T in 2018 So at the peak of the VW short squeeze VW accounted for roughly 0423227 13 of total market cap In 2018 13 of total market cap was 00136865T 893B At a market cap of 893B GME shares will be worth 12806 And this is a conservative estimate since the current total market cap is considerably larger than it was in 2018 TLDR The price of GME shares could reach anywhere from 12k to 28k Obligatory üöÄüöÄüöÄ,2021-03-11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2h4zy/why_the_price_of_gme_shares_could_reach_anywhere/

m3i8kc,None,N/A,How to Keep Your Newly Minted Title of Millionaire,Discussion,8,0.9,Goaliescottie,1027,So you did it You did your due diligence you did the math you summoned your courage to press that Buy button and now those stocks and options have granted you a title you only dreamed of having Millionaire Congratulations You beat the odds that so many before you have failed to overcome You played the game and came out on top Now its time to buy that house you always dreamed of or that car you always wanted to drive right Sure if you want to lose your title of millionaire However if you d like to stay a millionaire there are some things you may like to consider This is not financial advice but rather 3 pieces of life suggestions A survival guide so to speak of the next 6 months and how to protect your new title ampx200B First protect it from everyone else DONT TELL ANYBODY If there is one thing you take away from this let it be this So let me repeat that DONT TELL ANYONE This is going to be your most well kept secret in your life You will probably feel the urge to tell your friends and your family but doing this WILL ruin your life Why Well everyone is gonna want a cut Theyre gonna say they need that new device or they need that new car or they need this or that Theyll bring up how far you go back Suddenly youll see the very people who have been your friends turn on you like vultures They may think they have your best interests in mind and they may not the harm theyre causing but theyll smell money and theyre gonna come asking In that case youve gotta be the bad guy Youve gotta be the one to say no And friendships are going to quickly fall apart as you deny them Or youre gonna bleed your money helping everyone while they take advantage of you and indulge their overspending habits To put it differently this isnt a question of who do you tell because word spreads Rather this is a question of social survival Do you want to maintain your relationship with your friends and family Yes Then keep it to yourself Money talks but wealth whispers ampx200B Second protect it from expenses If you want this money to last more than 5 years youre gonna want to treat it as if it wasnt there Wait what Then why do I have this money if Im not gonna use it You will use it Just not as a sum of cash If you have 18 million you are not going to go out and buy a 1 million dollar house and a 200000 Lamborghini Youll only have 600000 left Instead you might want to turn to FIRE or Financial Independence Retire Early There you are going to use your newfound money as a source of income An easy equation for this is 4 Thats it Thats the equation 4 of your net worth can be used yearly while your money still sits in investments and accrues roughly 7 interest annually This way you beat inflation and you cover your expenses So to use our 18 million under the 4 rule thats 72000 you can spend annually and in theory you will never run out of funds while never working another day in your life Or if you enjoy what youre doing you can add that to the equation as well How you break it up is up to you but you can very easily spend north of 100000 a year and still be in the green if you hold down a job Meanwhile lets check in on our 600000 Thats 24000 a year you can spend for the rest of your life if you wanted to retire today Thats uncomfortably close to poverty You dont deserve that ampx200B Third protect it from yourself Yes Yourself As quickly as you made your money you can easily lose it in the best 2 weeks of your life So right now emotions are probably high Youre beyond excited you are itching to do something crazy with your money and probably want to buy something since you cant tell anyone per part 1Dont buy anything right now Yes you read that right Dont buy anything If you need any proof on that look up what happens to lottery winners roughly 35 of which go bankrupt Rather set the money aside for a while You can determine this amount of time but a good rule of thumb is 6 months In those 6 months it gives you plenty of time to calm yourself collect your thoughts and figure out an actual plan on how to wisely use that money How you want to invest it how much you want to use per year and how much you owe in taxes Yes The dreaded tword Taxes Youve gotta pay up And during that planning process youll have to come to terms with what this money is going to do for your life ampx200B So there you have it A starter guide on how to survive your first days as a new millionaire written by someone who has never been a millionaire But I have seen some people make some awful mistakes about money and did my due diligence on what happens after someone gains a massive windfall And I have a feeling that more than a handful of you might be seeing a windfall come your way in the near future ampx200B To close they say money cant buy you happiness but Im often reminded of the scene from Captain America httpsireddit6zrwsfsstlm61gif Money is only going to amplify how you want to live your life If you want to live generously leaving anonymous gifts and donations giving all you have away you can do that If you want to live egregiously expensive and live it up over spending at every turn you can also do that But you will need to face the consequences of either decision And if you in your nature default to one of these paths but dont want to it will take all the more effort to avoid it than if you didnt have this money at all ampx200B Oh who am I kidding This is WallStreetBets You will all be fine Just be careful my friends As this is a fight that may last the rest of your life,2021-03-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3i8kc/how_to_keep_your_newly_minted_title_of_millionaire/

need to be 80 of all offmarket and long volume trades to be under 100 I changed the formula for the cost of OM volume to match the lowest price of the days as the off market is mainly Darkpool trades New Conclusions We can conclude that the of volume used for covering is far less than their average of 3075 since the 15th of january as a result of a big ol FOMO rally from retail and a bull effort from institutions hogging up that volume Therefore it is not crazy to derive that SI IS OVER 700 with a cost well over 5 billion to do so IMPORTANT NOTES What I found was a tendency for these Short Sellers to get cocky and not cover on weeks when you would have expected them to This means some weaks with low SV had HUGE net gains in shorts This never worked in reverse in the data ampx200B httpspreviewreddit1j1f094h6um61pngwidth1031ampformatpngampautowebpampsc000f8086573c128e653722ed86117985e43b4cb PROOF THAT FINRA DATA IS IMPOSSIBLE If you were to take the FINRA DATA from the 15th of january to the 24th of February you would find that they wouldve needed to Cover using 3032 of all transfers for the entire month and a half Proof 1 It would have been impossible for them to comprise that portion of the covering with the FOMO wave and GAMMA squeeze that was hogging the data at the time This 3032 is notable There was a considerable boost in daily volume in that period So you are talking about a MINIMAL COST OF 3446 BILLION DOLLARS using my formulas from my previous data That being the bare minimum amount just to lower it to the SI they said it was at Proof 2 We have not witnessed a loss of 2265 Billion USD or more from institutions in that time That would have been a net loss btw no bankruptcies were seen either I said above that I noticed that Short Sellers did not cover when the data suggested they had the opportunity That this trend never reversed a High weekly SV yielded a net gain in short positions Proof 3 SV has remained over 50 throughout the 15th to 24th period which provides evidence of a net gain in shorts not a complete dip of the SI Lastly if all this was the way they say it did then Proof 4 The stock price would not have dropped during the period if they had covered The data HEAVILY implies that shorts are used and held to stop upwards momentum ampx200B His Reposnse to feedback ampx200B gtShort volume of total volume cant reliably tell you how many new shorts have entered or covered that day because belowA market maker selling you a share that they havent yet matched up with an actual seller but do a few seconds later will get counted as a short position momentarily This apparently can and does happen and gets counted in the short volume Meaning exactly no new short positions were taken but the short volume went up anyway I believe this is actually explained on FINRAs website httpswwwfinraorgrulesguidancenoticesinformationnotice051019httpswwwfinraorgrulesguidancenoticesinformationnotice051019 On the flip side it does tell you the absolute highest number of short positions that could have been taken that day so new short positions could be anywhere between 0 and the high short volume amount but due to the above as well as shorts entering and the covering in the same day means you cant really gleam anything from it reliably Sorry 1 What you are describing would create a net neutral movement on the share price which was not seen More importantly the data I aquired clearly shows that there was a net gain of shorts when compared to the long volume which is where they could have covered day after day after day It is possible but the data says that they have been creating more shares than they can possibly cover even if they were 100 of the long volume everyday which as we know is 90 algos and day traders I look at things from a scientific lens All I aimed to do was to show that it is financially and numerically IMPOSSIBLE FOR SI TO HAVE LOWERED SINCE THE 15TH OF JANUARY It was the running assumption that everyone who believed in this had and I provided damning evidence for it being the case ampx200B gtThis is not how it works Not saying that GME short interest is X or Y But literally this is not how it works you really can‚Äôt use short volume to determine short interest INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS Mods please don‚Äôt delete üì∑ I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means Importantly it doesn‚Äôt mean what you think This isn‚Äôt FUD it‚Äôs just how market making works TLDR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate buy orders and they immediately cover with the next trade High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless That sounds crazy but that‚Äôs how market making works FINRA report is only for off exchange trades dark pools It‚Äôs a myth that dark pools are all institutional your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like Citadel Virtu etc1402A MM makes money on the spread between buying and selling obviously What happens is your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool The MM a computer SHORTS you those shares at 108793 and then BUYS those shares back at 108791 A short of 100 shares is recorded This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float The MM isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgoing short‚Äù GME They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later So high short volume in the FINRA report which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades dark pools does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting It often reflects high levels of buying Um Like we just saw this week Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades You don‚Äôt have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here Generally speaking the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true It‚Äôs just not for the reasons you think ampx200B I didnt assume you were FUD but its a little sus when you open like that hahahahh same as my answer for the last one my data clearly shows that financially and data wise there are more shorts being taken on most days where the only way for them to even be below what they were on the 15th would be for them to litterally bankrupt themselves in the process What you describe there would have a net neutral effect on the share price Share price plummetted as Short Volume exceeded long volume That is the fact The data disagrees with your rebuttal ampx200B gtNo this post is misinformation You cannot gauge short interest from short volume Because a majority of short volume is closed in seconds I keep telling people this You should really make a wiki or sidebar notice about short volume So much misinformation and misplaced hype because of short volume High short volume does NOT mean high short interest To be clear i believe short interest is super high for GME but not due to short volume There has been lots of legit DD done on this But focusing on short volume is straight misinformation propagated by people who dont know what theyre talking about ampx200B 3 Same as the top two Maybe try and actually take the time to read my the data I took hours transcribing and making palletable before waving it off and calling me Fake News K In conclusion the data proves that SI has gone up The only argument Ive heard is the they cover instantly one which isnt whats shown in the data at all its litterally the entire point of me showing Short Volume Overflow to show how many more shorts there are compared to longs daily If it were true wed have risen consistently as this theory would have 0 effect on the share price What actually happened is they shorted it to 40 ampx200B Personally as in umoonski s opinion the feedback from you all is excellent and whilst I am still sceptical of the high s and the total accuracy of the derived info I still think it is very valuable in at least showing that reported SI is esesntially total horseshit All we really have is S3 amp FINRA delayed self reported data telling us SI is constantly dropping yet price action does not suppport such a low liquidity stock being covered from over 200 SI in January Also very weirdly the data goblin himself Ihor of S3 aka the iHorse hes ihors3 on twitter ffs tweeted yesterday that GME is a 1010 on his new squeeze score aka the squeezeometer How this is derived is a secret So its 1010 squeeze potential yet SI is plumetting at a mere 15 according to himself mhm Thus I am still totally convinced that SI is gt100 and this data shows that there is no way it is what is being report by the likes of S3 or FINRA is accurate What we are doing here if not proving to you what the magical SI number definitely is is showing that SI is substantially higher than what reports are claiming I am also certain GME has a significant issue with synthetic shares due to the volume of trading being a significant of the total free float size of 50m more like 24m in reality AMC a popular meme stock trades at 30 float and most non meme popular stocks trade far far far lower than this in terms of volume float Interestingly I did come across this SI was at 132 on Feb 8th according to SampPglobal you know the guys whos name is in the SampP500 in an article posted on Feb 18 httpswwwspglobalcommarketintelligenceennewsinsightslatestnewsheadlinesshortinterestinusstocksdeclinesinaftermathofgamestopsagadatashows62699063httpswwwspglobalcommarketintelligenceennewsinsightslatestnewsheadlinesshortinterestinusstocksdeclinesinaftermathofgamestopsagadatashows62699063 They later claimed on March 2nd that SI had dropped to 24 in mid february which makes absolutely no sense given price action 132 to 24 as the stock hoves around 40 Ok then So yeah enjoy your saturday

Coupang Inc DD Ticker CPNG Initial bullish info for the apes who cant stand to read more than 100 words Talked about and known as the ‚ÄúAmazon of South Korea‚Äù Coupang has been the second largest ecommerce IPO since Alibaba Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018 IPO jumped more than 70 Company was valued at 9B back in June 2020 and now is valued at around 90B with a market cap of 86B at the time of writing CEO‚Äôs a Harvard grad of the dropout just like Zuckerberg Coupang has the highest market share of Koreas Ecommerce business Improved cash flow by almost a billion dollars in a year Similar to Amazon in early years with no GAAP profitability but massive cash flow Coupangs the most used online shopping platform in south Korea Coupang has continuingly growing branches in Food delivery and grocery services Coupang has same day and dawn delivery place an order by midnight and get it by 7am Eco friendly packaging Customer Base has grew by an approximate 148 million from 2019 to 2020 up more than 25 Now for people who want wrinkles in their brain please continue on reading Quantitative Net Revenue for 2020 12B up more than 90 from 2019 Customer base Grew approximately

since been increased to 86B Use of Proceeds Net IPO of Class A common stock was 3500 and jumped to 6900 nice once it was available to trade However the company has stated they will not be taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization financial flexibility and create a public market for their stock Net Proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including working capital operating expenses and capital expenditures Coupang is currently not planning to pay dividends and rather invest in themselves I really like this because they know exactly what and where their assets are and implies they will be heavily reinvesting into those assets in attempts to grow them Amazon has and is using the same formula by not paying dividends not focusing on revenue but focusing on growing their brand recognition and customer base their largest asset Amazons TTM use of cash graph below which I predict will mirror Coupangs in the future Again though I don‚Äôt know anything üì∑ Profitability on a GAAP basis was not positive However from a cash flow basis they generated over 300M from operations and continue to generate cash flow in order to boost their operations and reinvest in themselves and grow their customer base which continues to be their strongest asset Opportunity Koreas GDP ‚Äúgross domestic product‚Äù overall economic performance of a country usually over a year is over 16 Trillion and a GDP per capita per person of 31847 This number continues to grow year after year as well as

down the use of cardboard boxes by more than 75 Items are delivered in a simple sleeve and sorted into protective bins Ecofriendly bags that are completely reusable and replace almost all disposable packaging The reusable bags are picked up by the delivery network for further use Trucks leave full of products and rather than coming back empty they arrive with returned packages and the packaging of other orders which are then immediately used once again for another delivery Employees work 5 day work weeks instead of the industry standard 6 Employees are provided with paid time off and full benefits amazon employees dont even get Amazon Prime Amazon employees also have not reported the best working conditions ‚ÄúPeople arent the friendliest‚Äù ‚Äúyoure expected to work like a machine‚Äù ‚ÄúWork life balance can be hard‚Äù ‚Äúneeds more benefits etc Coupang Inc will also be granting their frontline workers more than 90M worth of stock and will be the first company in Korea to make their employees shareholders 70 of suppliers for Coupang are also small merchant and business owners with under 3M in revenue per year In the pandemic small businesses on Coupang saw their sales increase by over 50 Coupang now sits as one of the largest employers in Korea with 50000 employees and plans to invest over 870M into building seven new regional fulfillment centers creating a

Coupang that is offered to their WOW members at no additional cost Coupang Play is currently available for android users and is expected to be supported by IOS systems sometime this year as well as expanding into smart TVs and PCs Coupang play has everything from Hollywood movies like the SpiderMan series and ‚ÄúBombshell to popular Korean movies and TV shows I‚Äôd name them but I don‚Äôt think any of us know what they are Coupang play also has documentaries educational videos kids shows and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks Coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the ONLY streaming service in Korea where users are able to watch things like Bryan Cranstons show ‚ÄúYour Honor‚Äù and CNN 10 Stephen Kim the head of Coupang Play is also on record for saying ‚ÄúWe are eager to bring content such as Coupang Play Originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers‚Äù Coupang Eats has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in Korea which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by Coupang Coupang Eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for Rocket Delivery and Rocket Fresh making delivery as fast and efficient as possible Coupangs customer centricity continues to be their most important asset as 70 of the population is 7 miles from a distribution center The company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to ‚Äúpursue operational excellence and innovation‚Äù in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have Customer Base has also grown by an approximate 148 million from 2019 to 2020 up more than 25 Part of Coupangs business model states all of this and I would have reworded it but it truly is perfect and I don‚Äôt think I could have done a better job When I first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company Not to mention again that this is VERY similar to how Amazon approached their business in the early years The statement is as follows ‚ÄúWe believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term Our longterm investments in building a differentiated technologyorchestrated network and customerfacing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale We have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully such as with our ownedinventory selection Rocket WOW membership Rocket Fresh and Coupang Eats among others We will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers We will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our shortterm results‚Äù Top Risks Coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth Coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth Same strategy as Amazon so in my eyes not a downside Dilution The company has stated that there will be was immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price Though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing out of all the evidence from Coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow I believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion I believe this dilution is why Coupang had a red day on Friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out This does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses However I think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with Coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding as well as just going public Still though it lessens shareholders position and lowers PE which is a measure of profitability but again we know Coupang is not focusing on this at the moment All this changes in my eyes is that I‚Äôm going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends I have tried looking around for other reasons why Coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south Korea but I have yet to find any info If anyone does a link would be greatly appreciated and I will edit with new info TDLR In my OPINION based on everything I‚Äôve read and compiled here I truly think Coupang has Unlimited potential The company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself Its constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with Coupang Play and Rocket Fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets Their management team looks very Promising with backgrounds in Amazon Uber and A fuck load of computer engineering Year after year revenue has been up customer base has been up and operating loss and net loss have been down This company looks very promising in my eyes and I definitely will be investing in Coupang in years to come Thanks to everyone who stuck through all this Again its my first ever DD so hopefully its not too shit I put a lot of effort and research into this and I hope yall gain some insight to this awesome company PLEASE let me know if theres anything I should‚Äôve included in this I am hoping to get a lot better at this whole ‚Äústonks‚Äù thing As you may have noticed I haven‚Äôt given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly simply because I‚Äôm waiting for my next paycheck so I can afford to buy some I currently don‚Äôt own shares in Coupang but you can bet your ass I‚Äôm buying as much as I can the next time I have money to throw at the market Wouldn‚Äôt you want to get into Amazon in 2005 Thanks again Onions THIS IS NOT FINACIAL ADVISE Sources

m4cka9,GME,-1.90%,GME Technicals DD short interest,DD,47,0.92,HomeDepotHank69,221,This will be long apes so please bull with me This is going to be a breakdown of GMEs chart from a technical perspective as well as my thoughts on the short interest and where this is all going I would just like to apologize in advance for all of the lines on my charts I am fucking retarded and my smooth brain needs lots of lines but Ill try to make it easy to understand Technical breakdown On the 20 day chart we can see that GME is going up in a stairstep pattern which is obviously extremely bullish A stairstep pattern is where it rises up consolidates lightly then uses the previous resistance as support for the next stairstep We are currently in a consolidation phase of that stairstep As you can see the red lines that I circled were previously resisstance but are now support This is bullish ampx200B httpspreviewredditsacw2jztcum61pngwidth2218ampformatpngampautowebpamps9ee1373bb21434559cf835cd9cc96e27d3151c9b Next and probably one of my favorite things is the fact that on the day we went from 348 all the way down to 180 we had STRONG support at the 180 level which as I said above was the resistance from the first step which is now our support Even better is the fact that our current consolidation is forming a pennant pattern from that support A pennant pattern usually indicates that a stock will continue its trend in this case up This is extremely bullish dare I say apeish The orange lines show the pennant pattern that Im talking about and the two circles show the high and low of that pattern lmao also kinda looks like a torpedo cock and balls Its important to note that although the chart makes it appear that it will be breaking that pattern soon the pennant could just extend so do not think that its going to break the pattern on Monday because though it very well could it could also just continue consolidating ampx200B httpspreviewreddit5q6m693wcum61pngwidth2222ampformatpngampautowebpampsf323375e4cbe77a09f904504c074dadee2823c5a When it finally stops consolidating and breaks this pattern to continue rising the green line above should act as support for our next stair step which would put us at 350ish for support which is huge For the 90 day chart you can see that a few weeks ago we broke the giant triangle pattern which is how we got into the current bullish movement Those lines are yellow ampx200B httpspreviewreddit7gwk7ocxcum61pngwidth1586ampformatpngampautowebpamps1955427bbbc72fb02af1766c5a04ec80403e2960 Finally in the chart above I have marked the areas of CRUCIAL resistance These are the fat green yellow and red lines I made them those colors because each one that we break is more crucial than the previous one because of the last squeeze What to take away from the chart action we are currently in a consolidation period of a stairstep pattern that has happened because we broke the triangle pattern that we started after the price went down from the last squeeze This is very bullish apeish Again I apologize for all the lines Im a technical trader and I make a shit ton of support and resistance lines for my smooth brain Volume everyone is talking about the squeeze shorts and price action and blah blah but the thing that everyone needs to be talking about is volume VOLUME VOLUME VOLUME The ONLY WAY that any type of squeeze can happen is volume I know that people dont like the VW comparison and Im not comparing them here just using this as an example but the squeeze was only able to happen because of tremendous volume ampx200B httpspreviewredditiiet237zcum61pngwidth1280ampformatpngampautowebpamps82223652adfe00a84ee32197351b72cef79b9785 As far as GMEs current volume we are not there but dont get down on it becuase WE WILL BE The only way for shorts to be squeezed is for a major influx of volume to drive the price up significantly forcing them to cover In the previous squeeze volume spiked tremendously and would have continued to increase if brokerages wouldnt have cut off buying The CEO of Interactive Brokers even said that the price would reach over 1k if they didnt shut of buying why Volume So for GMEs volume its plain and simple it needs to increase but I will not that the fact that the price is increasing so much without massive volume is even more bullish apeish But Hank how does volume increase Excellent question tard brain For GME and most stocks but especially GME catalysts are what drives volume up Below is a picture of GMEs volume since the January action ampx200B httpspreviewredditrcu25cl0dum61pngwidth1088ampformatpngampautowebpamps2d90f2c7ba53929f73b6dfbc02d2b9f23f84c7a2 The first spike in volume was in late November when Ryan Cohen announced his stake but the jump wasnt super significant The first big spike that you can see is on January 1113ish when they announced that Ryan Cohen was being added to the board In the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention The next jump in volume lots of red is when Andrew Left of shitron had his weeklong downsyndrome tantrum about GME and get his cheeks clapped by WSB This giant volume orgy is continued for the next few days when Elon tweets Gamestonk Chamath buys a bunch of calls and other celebrities like Mark Cuban voice their support We then see volume teeter off because of the brokerage cucks ass ramming us The next spike in volume corresponds to when GME ousted their CFO many thought that Ryan Cohen led this We then see volume decrease a little Volume the picks back up when GME announces that it has appointed Cohen as the head of their committee on changing GME to a digital company Volume has since gone down a little but the price has gone up erection What to take from this Plain and simple volume is king Volume is your wifes boyfriends wifes boyfriends bosss wifes boyfriend We cannot have another squeeze without volume BUT volume especially in GMEs case is greatly correlated with catalysts Volume Catalysts Here are some potential volume catalysts that could lead to the massive spike that we need GME appointing a new CFO GME appointing Ryan Cohen as CEO better than expected earnings an acquisition supportinvestment from big names ie Cuban Elon Burry etc new committeesinitiativesanything relating to their digital transformation quadruple witching day March 19th still not sure how I feel about this and definitely dont think its the be all end all that many others do but it could certainly help Overall it appears that the best catalysts are ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and digital transformation Personally I think that if during their earnings call Cohen announces hes gonna be CEO or announces some big digital move that will give us the volume we need Its important to note that it appears that Ryan Cohen wants this to happen and why wouldnt he his net worth is tied to it as evident by the tweets that hes put out that though cryptic seem to be implying support of WSB and hatred of shorts Roaring Kitty has also been very cryptic lately and it appears that he thinks something big is coming too this is just speculation tho Im tard TTM Squeeze and MACD Two of my favorite indicators are MACD and TTM squeeze I dont wanna explain them here because I only have so many chromosomes available to me each day but they essentially indicate momentum On my charts I combine the MACD lines with the TTM squeeze because they move similarly and I think that TTM is superior to MACDs histogram As you can see on the 1year chart the MACD is in a VERY bullish pattern right now What Im more excited about is the TTM squeeze the colorful bars In a TTM squeeze indicator the light blue lines indicate that the price has extremely bullish momentum its in relation to Bollinger bands and keltner channels When the bars turn dark blue there is still bullish momentum but its fading The red bars indicate bearish momentum and the yellow bars indicate fading bearish momentum As you can see are currently in some VERY Strong light blue bars For a TTM Squeeze there are usually 710 light blue bars in an extremely bullish pattern From the last squeeze you can see that there are like 5 really tiny light blue bars and then like 3 bigger ones This indicates that we are currently in the middle ofapproaching giant price action but also that the current price action is better than last time and is forming a more stable high arching uptrend If youre thinking oh man Unlce Hank weve already had 5 light blue bars the squeeze is almost over not so fast tard Though I said that theres usually 710 of these bars in an uptrend thats not always the case and going to dark blue bars simply may mean that we are consolidating and will go back to light blue bars Overall all this should show you is that yes we are in a bullish trend and things are looking perfect This is one of my favorite indicators and I believe that its giving us INSANELY good signs ampx200B httpspreviewreddit4jopywl2dum61pngwidth1318ampformatpngampautowebpamps3ac7c78bc7fcea8092f966f5a73c8fb5017f2ece A note about squeezes Let me be clear if the brokerages wouldnt have cut off buying this would have gone up past 1000 IB CEO said this and hes a boomercuck Because of this last time was not a short squeeze it was a gamma squeeze or a series of them A short squeeze would have resulted in a parabolic move to the upside accompanied by a parabolic jump in volume Both the price and volume would look like very tall and skinny triangles see the Volkswagen pattern for this A short squeeze does not happen over time it happens suddenly and very violently to the upside Gamma squeezes on the other hand can happen over a period of time and can happen in small or big chunks Its important to note that gamma squeezes can cause short squeezes and short squeezes can exacerbate game squeezes its a feedback loop which is why its so dangerous So currently I think that we are in the middle of a series of gamma squeezes that could lead to a short squeeze if there is a catalyst that creates volume Shorts A lot of numbers have been floating around about short interest Some say its 13 27 40 50 60 120 and well above 200 Ive even seen 900 IMO its impossible to know right now FINRAs release said it was about 50 and thats the one that I believe to be the most likely definitely dont believe FINRAs 27 assplay HOWEVER its important to note that those 100 numbers very well could be correct The reason for this is because they cant take into consideration naked shorts if you dont know about this there are 100s of DDs about it So IMO there are 2 scenarios here 1 Its literally just 50ish short interest on GME Let me be clear THIS IS STILL HUGE Anything above 30 is huge so 50 is still amazing and has massive short squeeze potential for GME 2 Its actually above 200 If the latter is true then the squeeze WILL 100 happen and will also probably crash the financial system because as we know from 2008 when institutions get into these shady unregulated derivative bets on volatile things it usually creates a collateral effect Personally I have no clue which one is correct The latter obviously sounds like a conspiracy but could very well be true because we all know how shady these funds are However it begs the question why are they still doing this The answer to this is they are either retarded and not in a good way doing it out of anger and spite and we all know how well emotional trading goes or they are in a bind and cant get out of it Personally I think that the conspiracy about naked shorts and everything is either extremely false or extremely true If its extremely true then HFs are just kicking the can down the road hoping that we lose interest and the price decreases If its false then we still have 50 short interest apes and Daddy Cohen TLDR on this paragraph short numbers are conflicting and its impossible to know which is correct or if the naked short theory is true Either way I like the stock Closing thots The most important thing as I said is fucking volume This is not just gonna magically happen Sure the price could very well keep increasing over the coming daysweeks on low volume and small gamma squeezes could happen but until we get a surge in volume through a catalyst we are not going to see the short squeeze REMEMBER the squeeze has not squoze until there is a parabolic move in price and volume over a very short period of time Im talking trading getting halted 5 times in a single day on the upside Do I think that these next few weeks are going to be very important yes especially next week and earnings week but do I think its over if not fuck no So with that being said please try to avoid talking about dates as a certainty because it could lead to some of the younger tards selling because theyre disappointed Make sure to do what Rensole does and say that it COULD happen that its a possibility not that its the endgame or a certainty Finally continued talk about GME continued buying and holding and continued retardation are key THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR I SIMPLY HAVE A SMALL PENIS AND AN ADDICTION TO CUCK PORN TLDR I Like the

holding overnight it always gives me the hangover of loss It always ends the same my account is in disarray I feel a sense of hopelessness and everything in my life Id worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like Stimulus Checks set to arrive But this timethis time it really could be different The FOMC is coming up this week starting March 16th For the unitiated this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on the FED gives their guidance in matters including‚Äîbut not limited toQuantitive Easing Interest Rate speculation and Bond Yield Curve controlhttpswwwgooglecomampsthinkingcomamparticleuswhattowatchatthemarchfedmeeting Market volatility precedes it as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa Pow might or might not say or do‚Äîif the man farted into the microphone and walked away VXX would probably climb 15the tension is palpable This one couldn‚Äôt come at a more precarious time as good news is now bad news As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word He promises a steady hand he promises no interest rate increases he says bond yield curve control is always on the tableand yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll You see the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say investors see the inevitable trend Theyre betting there is only so long the FED can continue to artificially support the marketand only so long there will be reason to as indexes roar the actual economy improves and vaccine distribution is for the most part on track to return us to a world of pseudonormalcy by summer It doesnt help that the FED stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on Yield Curves definitively during speaking engagements and quietly ended the term repo m lending programhttpswwwbloombergcomnewsarticles20210127fedendingtermreposreflectsliquidityfeastfordealers My choice here is between treasurytickers and the VXX last time I was making this choice I went with VXX on the DD and that choice didnt pan out until the second week I said then reflecting on that week‚Äôs losers that I should have chosen treasuriesso why didn‚Äôt I this time with the opportunity right here VXX is just absurdly low right now trading under 14 Im not saying the pop will happen Tuesday or Wednesday but it may and dollars to donuts if you hold a VXX 14 or 1450c 41 youll make some money at some point if you dont hold too long after it makes a run Also if Jerome breathes a word about Yield Control they will plummett This intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low‚Äîthere is too much potential for chop Sure I could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people‚Äôs accounts and that argument is fair as I see some of the new age commodities mooning to ATH over the wekend But for the most part Id rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks dont come back burning me But anyway you didn‚Äôt come here for my halfbaked philosophy on impending market volatility YOU CAME CUZ YOU HEARD WE GOT THEM BAGGERS So lets talk whales Shoutout to unusual whales who makes this possible through letting me share their

pivot call but Friday brought us the glory I was sweating though üòÖ Last week‚Äôs lesson GE and DIS were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on Monday then they hit us with that nasty curve News broke that GE was closing a huge deal on Sunday which gave me continued optimism and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse splitif you say you saw that coming yous a damn lie DIS got great news but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number is that TA I dont know man I think so and couldnt hold I think the key here is it‚Äôs okay to take a pause on the pick if it‚Äôs hot fresh out the gate the week of the RAMBO There will be more picks The other lesson here is that when the event is big enough it plays like an earnings rather than a pump DKNG for example had pump written all over it It was more about future potential than earnings in the description Conversely the GE annual event had an ER feel particularly in articles I read Tuesday Meme

foreign delisting wasnt as big a deal as people were intimating Sometimes you gotta plug your nosehate the stonk love the RAMBO The general consensus around this event is that this is moment NOK needs to do SOMETHING to please investors NOK is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts The key pump factor here is whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policythats what Im watching for If we get the dividend announcement the sky is the limit If we dont well bail out quickly because this sinking ship may head for Davey Jones Locker Im so corny bruh üò≠ Somebody

CPNG Coupang aka Amazon of Korea aka Chef Pang aka C Piddy because yall need to put some respect on its name Its one of the largest tech companies to IPO on the NYSE ever 55B and the largest tech IPO in South Korean history This isnt just some company Its THE company Some of its notable backers are Softbank Blackrock Bill Ackman Stanley Druckenmiller and David Frankel Before trying to understand Coupang you have to understand South Korea as a country APE MUST READ South Korea is a firstworld country with the 11th largest economy ie GDP in the world That makes them bigger than Russia Spain Australia Mexico Indonesia Netherlands Turkey Saudi Arabia Switzerland Poland Taiwan Sweden Belgium Thailand Argentina Nigeria Iran you get the point httpsworldpopulationreviewcomcountriescountriesbygdphttpsworldpopulationreviewcomcountriescountriesbygdp They also have the 7th largest ecommerce market in the world httpswwwbusinesscomarticles10ofthelargestecommercemarketsintheworldbhttpswwwbusinesscomarticles10ofthelargestecommercemarketsintheworldb It is also the ultimate turnaround story Up until the mid1900s they were a thirdworld Japanese colony but in 2021 it is a first world country with one of the largest economies in the world And they did this in about 40 years with their focus on tech and industrials as well as entertainment Samsung Hyundai Kia LG KPop KPop is an international sensation right now 564M export reported Aug 2020 last year and growing

Also just know how advanced they are technologically They have had RFID chips a decade before us Theyve had 5G for years They have the best esports gamers in the world They are no stranger to the worldwide web A big reason why they are so successful is because they are 2nd in the world in how much of their national GDP they spend on RampD

GETTING BACK TO COUPANG CPNG is only cash flow negative right now because they invested 100s of millions of dollars into their infrastructure allowing them to have 70 of South Koreas population 36 million 51 million within 7 miles of their distribution centers They can only do this because 50 of South Koreas population lives in the Seoul metropolitan area Yes 50 fucking percent 25 million people Thats like 3 New York Cities sidebyside httpsenwikipediaorgwikiSeoulCapitalAreahttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSeoulCapitalArea South Koreas annual online sales is 37 billion and ecommerce sales of total retail sales 98 httpswwwbusinesscomarticles10ofthelargestecommercemarketsintheworldbhttpswwwbusinesscomarticles10ofthelargestecommercemarketsintheworldb CPNG sales went from 6B in 2019 to 12B in

httpswwwcnbccom20210311coupangipostrategistsaysinvestorsshouldconsiderprofitoutlookhtmlhttpswwwcnbccom20210311coupangipostrategistsaysinvestorsshouldconsiderprofitoutlookhtml So if the South Korean ecommerce market grows at a 224 it will be 142B by 2024 httpswwwcnbccom20210311coupangipostrategistsaysinvestorsshouldconsiderprofitoutlookhtmlhttpswwwcnbccom20210311coupangipostrategistsaysinvestorsshouldconsiderprofitoutlookhtml RISKS amp REBUTTALS They sell mostly their own products OK theyve got strong customer loyalty Can they expand their business to incorporate more 3rd party sellers in the future Potential is there Low gross profit margin Retail has always historically been a low profit margin business Is it possible for them to introduce a new high margin product or service Absolutely Still cash flow negative Did you see the revenue growth 6B to 12B in one year Theyre a growth company in its early stages I also mentioned above how theyre investing 100s of millions into their infrastructure distribution centers within 7 miles of 70 of population They dont have AWS Its not a literal copy of Amazon They are also growing their ecommerce business before focusing on anything else Sales went from 6B to 12B in one year They need to saturate this market before focusing on anything else Its highly likely they will introduce new high profit product or service in the coming years Their founder is a Harvard drop out They dominate only in South Korea Whats wrong with that Even with the South Korean ecommerce market alone CPNG can become a 500B company They are focused on dominating their immediate market Im sure theyll create new services and create new sources of revenue Once the Korean market is saturated theyll figure out a way to expand These South Koreans are smart and good at tech Dont underestimate them VALUATION PRICE TARGET If in 2024 CPNG has a 40 market share they will have 57B in sales Amazon has 37 market share of US in 2020 With a conservative PS of 4 that puts CPNG FAIR VALUE at 133 PER SHARE 57B sales x 4 228B valuation If they are doing well and they have hype with a PS of 6 BABA has 6 CPANG has 7 then CPNG should be 200 PER SHARE 57B x 6 342B valuation And this is if they DONT CREATE ANY NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES Think about that No new products or services Just purely their ecommerce business and its still going to be worth 150200 PER SHARE If they launch an AWSlike thing or maybe another service thats just waiting to be discovered theyre going to do an additional 10B easy with the market share they have so add another 50 to the price targets As one of the technologically most advanced countries in the world CPNG is not here to stay Its here To takeover South Korea CONCLUSION My thesis is heavily dependent on them expanding their business with new high margin productsservices but this is a bet I am willing to make Harvard drop out Softbank Blackrock Bill Ackman one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world etc I guarantee they will innovate Oh and even if its not them developing something internally they can always acquire a company Theyre going to do billions in profits soon That is a lot of money Its under 50 today With an 87B valuation Its literally

m5w89m,APHA,2.87%,Cannabis DD Why üí©Trulieveüí© will SUFFER from Marijuana Reform APHA üöÄüöÄ,DD,8,0.83,OverwatchNWeed,67,As a cannabis investor one of my favorite debates to jump in or read is the MSOs vs LPs However those discussions are usually way too vague and should be comparing the top companies at the very least instead of a general US vs Canada Lets talk about Trulieve and Aphria mostly Trulieve Multi State Operator MSO US companies Licensed Producers LP Canadian Companies Trulieves success is literally a house of cards and I personally will enjoy watching it fall Florida is one of the most restricted and monopolized cannabis markets in the US Over 80 of the market is controlled by 5 companies including Trulieve This kind of market is exactly what our politicians pushing reform DO NOT want This is not my opinion This is easily concluded with social justice and social equity being at the forefront of legalization It is the politicians intent to offer opportunities to minorities and communities hurt by marijuana prohibition and tax the fuck out of them on the back end I think its more likely these opportunities come on the retail side not the production side Trulieve has over 70 stores across Florida and they are all vertically integrated I know you already know what that means but just in case they sell their our products and only their own products Its a great business model of course but its all going to come crashing down for them and MSOs like them Lets think about what a legal market does to a company like Trulieve As of a 2020 study Florida had 11 dispensaries per 100k persons States like Oregon with legal marijuana or Oklahoma with a relaxed medical program each have over 15 dispensaries to every 100k persons Considering Florida is the 3rd most populated state I dont think its unreasonable to expect similar ratios for dispensaries per 100k if not higher This would mean 15x more competition at least literally Even 30 less dispensaries per 100k than an average open market would be 10 to 1 or 10x more competition Whats the bull thesis for Trulieve holding 50 market share in an open market like they do now in a monopolized market Lol Also as Ive said before they are currently vertically integrated and sell their own products exclusively This will not last for many different reasons So they will see massive amounts of new stores opening around them as well as having to stock their shelves for the first time with other brands They will be losing daily customers in droves and even the customers they do get in the door will be buying other products not made by Trulieve which is going to hurt their margins and the bottom line Hard Then they will start to see an excess of marijuana as they struggle to distribute their over 1m sqft of grow space If they lose even just 30 of their shelf space to competition LOW estimate they would lose 30 of shelf space across ever location they own Thats going to add up and stockpile quickly This is where a genius thinks they will just sell their product into other stores Okay Youre right there but only to a certain degree First off I dont see companies who maintained a monopoly being welcomed warmly into a legal market Its pretty easy to conclude more people will approach Trulieve with a grudge rather than a chubbie Also how many Trulievers will there be when hundreds of new brands are introduced Meanwhile APHA is already selling weed beer to 23 States and all Delta Airlines Flights hosts the largest 420 festival in Atlanta AND busy tackling a global cannabis market while they wait for the US to open Literally building a monopoly in the EU Obviously the US is the crown jewel but even Curaleafs CEO sees more opportunities in Europe than the US in the coming years So while Trulieve spends millions on stores in a single state APHA is spending millions building a global cannabis conglomerate These two stocks are not built the same By the way to be clear I think LPs like APHATLRY CRON CGC and even OGI are in a better position than MSOs like TRU High tide and any other retail heavy or monopoly focused companies Its the MSOs ready for the Next Green Wave lt who have 2 year supply agreements with the largest brands in cannabis Cookies in the largest markets California and MSOs with proven success as CPG businesses in crowded markets FFNT who should be getting more attention Not companies who suffer from legalization like TRU and SSPK Weedmaps is just a complicated google search Lol stores will operate their own online websites with online menus and not pay a commission to weedmaps ü§∑ Im not an expert or anything but I feel like people are saying they are investing in upcoming change but make decisions based on the market now The market youre investing for and the market that exists have very little in common generally TLDR APHA üöÄüöÄ TRUüí©üí©,2021-03-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5w89m/cannabis_dd_why_trulieve_will_suffer_from/

m5wglc,GME,-31.12%,GME Trading Strategy to Catalyze the Squeeze,DD,21,0.96,AJDillonsMiddleLeg,290,I made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on GME and several people asked that I turn that comment into a post so here it is Obviously Im going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze First the comment as it was Ive seen lots of bullish TA on GME Keep in mind ALL TA requires volume to play out how it should We havent had any volume on GME in over a week Holding shares simply isnt enough needs constant all day every single day buying of shares and IN THE MONEY options If you buy options that are 2030 in the money they literally cant price pin because they cant get and keep the price 2030 below current market So you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge and virtually eliminate their means of counterattack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain price at which most contracts expire worthless If you are intending to help push the squeeze buy shares throughout the day every day If you are playing options mostly buy calls in the money If youre buying OTM calls buy as close to current price as you can afford The more imbalanced OTM calls are the more theyre just going to price pin at maximum pain They literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new ITM call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge Essentially we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with Gamestop There are two major reasons 1 Manipulation We cannot do anything about this really aside from buy and hold Technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels The shorts while stuck in a stupid position arent stupid They know when the TA is indicating a bullish setup and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup 2 Volume All technical setups require volume to play out If volume doesnt follow the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable Except in this case it goes down because its being shorted at every chance So what do we need to do Hold Yes But that cant be it If we are doing nothing but holding this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient They can literally hold us in a stalemate for monthsyears if volume never shows up to move the price Yes they pay more interest the longer they have to wait Theyll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the SEC steps in to stop market manipulation Volume Without volume there is no endgame Look at every day weve had spikes Look at the volume Now look at the past week or two We arent making progress because nobody is buying shares aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks Believe it or not the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze The whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time If it catches on they can follow it up But if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail This thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days If you look at any day there are surges in buy volume but theyre short Thats likely a whale testing the market If they see confirmationfollowup from the market its less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure So it will be something like whale buy retail confirmation buys whale buy runaway effect gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze All of those things have to happen consecutively fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack Now this is going to sound counterintuitive but in order to catalyze the squeeze we have to stop just buying the dip When volume picks up and the price is spiking thats the most important time to buy Thats the point when additional buying pressure is most important And until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes we are going to keep bouncing back and forth Options The other side of the coin is options purchases Stop devoting the majority of your capital to far OTM lotto tickets This helps the short positions because it forces the market makers to help the shorts Market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk When you buy an 800c it does two things 1 They dont have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral 2 In incentivizes the market makers to pin the price You can do some additional reading on max pain price in options but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless When you buy OTM call options youre increasing the maximum pain price which makes it easier for market makers and shorts to pin the price there If however youre buying a ton of ITM call options youre doing two things 1 Deep ITM calls have a delta of essentially 100 This means that in order to remain risk neutral the market makers essentially has to buy 100 shares immediately upon selling you the contract 2 It lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most OI This means in order to pin the price at max pain they would need to drop it from its current price Not only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately meaning they dont care where the price goes you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price If you must buy OTM calls buy ones that are at least closer to being ITM The further OTM you buy calls the more likely the price will go sideways You can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases Once it achieves a runaway squeeze which will be easy to identify you can start buying your lotto tickets Tldr In my opinion if you want to help catalyze the squeeze you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least 1020 in the money

mk4pod,PAVE,-1.12%,An investment that will benefit from the infrastructure bill Check out PAVE ETF,Discussion,30,0.86,ralphsdiorama,33,If you are looking for an infrastructure investment look not further than PAVE ETF It‚Äôs holdings are well diversified across the physical digital and energy infrastructure found in the bill And options are still very cheap at the moment Here is everything you need to know about the etf from seeking alpha The Global X US Infrastructure Development ETF PAVE is in an excellent position to directly benefit from President Bidens American Jobs Plan that was announced on Wednesday in Pittsburgh PA The proposed plan targets over 14 trillion for direct investments into physical infrastructure including transportation schools hospitals and buildings as well as for energy water and digital infrastructure The PAVE ETF holds many of the companies that will provide the materials tools services and components required for this infrastructure buildout and should handsomely benefit from it INVESTMENT RATIONALE President Biden presented the American Jobs Plan part of his build back better initiative on Wednesday in Pittsburgh and the White House published a FACT SHEET on its website In a nutshell a broad summary of the infrastructure initiatives in the American Jobs Plan is shown below PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE Transportation infrastructure 621B Buildings schools and hospitals 250B Infrastructure resilience 50B ENERGY WATER AND DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE Cleantech clean energy and related infra 300B Water Utilities 111B Digital infrastructure 100b In total the aggregate spending targeted directly at these infrastructure projects is over 14 trillion The investment thesis here is simple find an infrastructure fund that can benefit directly from those investment dollars Lets take a look at the PAVE ETF and see what its prospects are going forward TOP HOLDINGS The PAVE Infrastructure Development ETFs Top10 holdings can be found on Global X ETF website and equate to roughly 30 of what I would characterize as a moderately concentrated portfolio that holds a total of 101 companies PAVE has 23 billion in assets so even a 32 weight of 1 holding Deere DE results in a 805 million stake Many investors would consider Deere and odd choice for an infrastructure ETF considering it is generally regarded as focused solely on agriculture However DE operates in three segments one of which is its Construction amp Forestry Segment This segment manufactures machines for earth moving road building graders excavators material handling crushers and screeners and asphalt pavers DE is up 178 over the past year yet has an estimated forward PE of only 233x The 2 holding with a 30 weight is motion control systems specialist ParkerHannifin Corp PH which operates a Diversified Industrial segment that provides sealing shielding vibration and thermal solutions as well as filters noise abatement and contaminate removal systems for water air fuel oil and other liquids PH is also up 170 over the past year has a forward PE224x and yields 11 The Eaton Corp ETN is the 3 holding and has 30 weight within the portfolio Eaton pays a 304 annual dividend yields 22 and has a forward PE249x The company is heavily involved in the power management sector and likely will provide many of the electrical components and assemblies needed to build out the electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure detailed in the American Jobs Plans investments into Clean Tech and Clean Energy The 4 5 and 10 holdings are railroad companies Norfolk Southern NSC Kansas City Southern KSU and CSX Corp CSX Along with 12 holding Union Pacific UNP these four holdings alone equate to 115 of the entire portfolio Obviously this ETF is betting that these rail freight providers will be hauling much of the gravel rock asphalt lumber steel and products and assemblies that will be needed to build out the infrastructure of roads bridges buildings and energy and water systems as detailed in the AJP These railroads will also benefit from opening up and a generally stronger economy Some of that has been fueled by the excellent progress the Biden administration and bigpharma when it comes to the vaccine rollout and as a result from general expectations that the US economy is opening up fast and will see very strong growth in the 2H of the year Meantime Canadian Pacific CP recently offered to buy KSU for 25 billion which has added some merger mania to the sector Surprisingly the fund does not hold Caterpillar CAT CAT is generally thought to be one of the main beneficiaries of an infrastructure bill But considering that stock has doubled over the past year perhaps the management team feels it is overvalued But with a forward PE283x and a 18 yield CAT seems to be an odd omission in my opinion Looking through the rest of the portfolio see the full list of holdings here we find many of the companies that sell the raw materials steel aluminum copper lumber asphalt filters etc needed to for as the basic building blocks for transportation electrical utility and water infrastructure PERFORMANCE PAVE ETF wins by a considerable margin over IFRA on a NAV basis and neither ETF pays that much in the way of income 064 and 14 respectively PAVE is 9x the size of IFRA which has 250 million in AUM Over a shorter timeframe that encompasses the yearofcovid19 and the period when discussions about an infrastructure bill to get Americans back to work with goodpaying jobs got serious PAVE has also outperformed the IFRA ETF by a significant margin FUND BASICS These metrics all come from the Global X PAVE ETF Webpage Expense Ratio 047 AUM 23 billion PE Ratio 322x Forward PE Ratio 219x PricetoBook 36x 30day SECyield 064 Roughly 87 of the fund is invested in the Industrials and Materials sectors RISKS Considering the strong rally the PAVE ETF has had over the past year in anticipation of the infrastructure bill much has already been built into the price That said note the fund is not overweight any highflying cleanenergy names and despite the growth of some of these stocks many still sell at very reasonable valuation levels see the forward PEs of some of the top holding discussed earlier The biggest risk is getting a substantial the American Jobs Plan through Congress It should get through the Democratically controlled House in roughly the same shape as presented As we learned with the American Rescue Plan despite the objections of some of the more progressive members of the Democratic Party they have shown some level of pragmatism in that they know if the legislation doesnt get through the very narrowly controlled Senate it wont matter what they pass in the House Much is likely to depend on what Senator Joe Manchin DWest Virginia decides he will support as if history is any indication the AJP will get zero Republicans votes so the Democrats must get all 50votes so that Vice President Harris can break the tie I believe the Democrats will push the legislation through because a recent poll by Navigator recently found broad bipartisan support over 80 for an infrastructure bill by American voters TLDR Summary amp Conclusion For those investors that dont typically invest in the infrastructure sector myself included but want to have some exposure to where their tax dollars are going in the American Jobs Plan the PAVE ETF seems like an excellent choice The portfolio is full of solidly profitable companies that are reasonably valued and in an excellent position to benefit from the buildout of US infrastructure PAVE is a BUY,2021-04-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mk4pod/an_investment_that_will_benefit_from_the/

m4a87a,None,N/A,I teach high school which means I explain things to idiots every day If you still dont understand call options I got you,Discussion,47,0.89,The_Superbus,3162,I see a lot of people asking basic questions about calls on just about every thread that mentions them So here you go Note before the finance majors come out and nitpick small things remember that this is a basic primer for idiots some of it has been simplified WHAT IS A CALL OPTION BASICS A call option hereafter referred to simply as a call is a contract that gives you the ability though not the obligation to buy 100 shares of a stock for a specific price by a specific date called the expiration date Example You buy a 400 call for GME that expires on March 19th What that means is that at any time between now and endofday on 319 you can buy 100 shares of GME for 400 If the price spikes to 700 dollars you can still buy them for 400 Thats a pretty good deal So I need the price of GME to get to 400 to break even and anything above that is profit right Not quite You have to pay a premium for the option which is the amount of money youre giving to the option seller in exchange for the contract The premium is listed as the price per share so if the option has a 2 premium that means that you have to pay 2 per share of GME in the contract which means that you pay 200 the buy the call 2share x 100 shares You give the seller 200 and they give you the call option Since you paid 200 for the option this means that your break even price is 402 dollars per share Why Because if the price only got to 400 you could have bought it for 400share without buying the contract which means the money you spend on the contract was a waste However if the price goes to 403share then you make a profit because you effectively paid 402share for a stock worth 403share But what if the price doesnt go up or even goes down Do I have to still buy those shares for 400 No You never have to buy the shares if you dont want to Remember a call gives you the ability to buy shares for 400 but not the obligation But what if the price of GME goes way up but I dont have 40000 around to buy 100 shares at 400share Then you sell the contract to someone who either does have 40000 sitting around or slightly advanced info here that you dont need to know to someone who is trying to offset a position Regardless of who buys it they will pay you a lot of money for your option because it is ITM or in the money What does that mean Lets look at some option vocabulary CALL OPTION VOCABULARY Strike Price This is the price that you are allowed to pay for the stock per the contract In our 400 call option above the strike price is 400 At any time before the expiration date you are allowed to exercise the contract the contract and pay 400share for the stock Exercise Exercising an option means you are exercising your ability to buy the 100 shares of stock In the example above you would spend 40000 for 100 shares of stock regardless of the stocks price at the time Can I exercise and only buy 20 shares of stock No If you cant afford to exercise then you can sell your option to someone else Expiration Date This is when your call expires if you have a 319 expiration date that means that your call option is no longer good after 319 Premium The premium is the price you pay to the callseller for the contract and it is listed as the price per share Knowing that how much will it cost to buy an option with a premium of 25 If you do the math it will cost you 25 which is 25share x 100 shares ITM and OTM In the Money and Out of the Money ITM calls are calls for which the stock price has exceeded the strike price If you have a 400 call and the price of GME goes to 405 then your call is ITM because you can buy a 405 stock for 400 If you then immediately sold the stock for 405 youd make money OTM calls are calls for which the stock price is below the strike price If you have a 400 call and the price of GME is 350 then your call is OTM It is important to realize that being ITM doesnt mean being profitable In the example above of the 400 call with a 2 premium if GME goes to 401 you are ITM because 401gt400 but you havent broken even yet because your breakeven price is 402 FDs FD is not an investment term and you dont need to know what it means in order to understand calls It is a WSB term and it stands for maggots delight but with an F because autmod wont let me define FDs FDs are OTM calls with short expirations and as such are a huge gamble The guy who spent 90k on 1dte 1 day to expiration OTM GME callshttpswwwredditcomrwallstreetbetscommentsm3r3v2foundouthowtobuycalloptionsyesterday Those were all FDs and they all expired worthless Why are they called FDs Because when you buy FDs you usually end up taking it in the ass WHEN PEOPLE LIST THEIR OPTION POSITIONS THEY USE A BUNCH OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS THAT I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW DO I FIGURE OUT WHAT THEYRE TALKING ABOUT You have probably seen something like this GME 400c 319 Lets break it down GME 400c 319 The GME stands for Gamestop which you probably figured out The 400c is a call option with a strike price of 400 If it said 400p it would be a put option but well talk about those later The 319 stands for the expiration date Now lets make it more complicated If I said I bought 10 5 GME 800c 319 what do I mean It means that I bought ten contracts of GME 800 calls with a 319 expiration and I paid 5 per share If I paid 5 per share how much did I spend on my contracts I spent 5000 5share x 100 shares x 10 contracts Now you try it A 700 call on GME that expires next week costs around seven bucks a share How would you explain to me that you bought two of them You would say that you bought 2 7 GME 700c 319 Now you can look like you know what youre talking about even though you still probably dont WHY DO PEOPLE BUY CALL OPTIONS This is confusing Why do people even do this People buy call options because you can make a lot of money If you have the right to buy 100 shares of something for a fixed price then for every 1 the share price goes above your breakeven price you make 100 If you have a 400c with a break even of 402 and the price gets to 412 then you make 1000 profit Thats 10 of profit 412402 times 100 shares You can buy the shares and hold them or you can buy them and sell them immediately to realize that profit Or you can sell the contract to someone else and just take the money It is usually better to sell the contract but thats not an important distinction because most of you cant afford to exercise anyway and will be selling contracts WHY ARE CALLS DANGEROUS When you buy a stock at least you own the stock If you buy an option and it expires worthless then you have nothing If the guy who bought 90k worth of FDs had bought 90k worth of GME and held then hed still have somewhere around 90k worth of GME 5 depending on when he bought on Thursday Instead he has nothing WHY DOES THE VALUE OF MY CALL KEEP CHANGING So you bought a call option and every time you look at it its worth a different amount of money Thats because there are actually two types of value in an option options have Intrinsic Value and Extrinsic Value Intrinsic Value is the exercisable value of the option If you own a 400c and the price is 412 then the intrinsic value of the option is 12share or 1200 because thats the value you would get if you exercised it right now as stock price goes up intrinsic value goes up Pretty easy Extrinsic Value has a more complicated definition so were going to call Extrinsic Value the potential the option has and that potential is based on time and volatility For example if there is a long time before expiration then that means that there is more potential for the option to go ITM because more time more chances for the price to rise Therefore options further from expiration will be worth more than options close to expiration Conversely less time to expiration less value which means that your option can constantly lose value as time goes on and the number of chances you have to go ITM decreases This is called theta decay but you dont need to worry about that Volatility is the second part of extrinsic value and options for stocks that are more volatile can be worth more than options for stocks that trade steadily because if a stock price swings wildly up and down theres a greater chance that one of those upswings will put you ITM This is reflected in a measurement called IV or Implied Volatility Like Theta Decay IV is a more advanced concept that you dont need to understand now as long as you get the basics Due to the factors of time theta and volatility IV constantly changing the extrinsic value of your option will also change over time This is why the value of your option will constantly change Is the stock calming down and starting to trade sideways low volatility Your option value will decrease as IV drops Is the stock starting to jump around Your option value will increase as IV increases Sometimes the stock price can be climbing slowly but the value of your option can be decreasing Why do you think that is If the stock value is increasing slowly but youre way OTM and running out of time because your option expires tomorrow the downward price pressure of theta decay can overcome the upward price pressure of volatility and stock price rise and your option value can decrease I BOUGHT A CALL AND IM ITM HOWWHEN DO I SELL MY CONTRACTS You can sell your contracts at any time You dont have to wait until the expiration to sell your contracts This is good because if the price spikes you can dump your options for profit and move on There was a point yesterday when 90k FD guys 275 and 285 calls were ITM when GME spiked to 290 If he had sold then he wouldnt have lost everything by waiting until expiration I BOUGHT A CALL AND IM ITM HOWWHEN DO I EXERCISE MY CONTRACTS Make sure that you have enough money to cover buying all the shares and click the exercise button They get your money and you get their shares This can take some time OK I GET IT BUT CAN YOU GIVE ME A TLDR JUST IN CASE I ACTUALLY DONT GET IT A call option is a contract to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price To buy the contract you pay a premium to the contract seller If the price of the stock goes above the price of your contract you can either buy the shares or sell the contract for profit The End SO IM AN EXPERT NOW AND CAN GO YOLO EVERYTHING ON CALLS AND MAKE MONEY No You have a basic understanding of how calls work and know just enough to be dangerous Dont go crazy Buy a call See how it works for real Dont YOLO your life savings on your newfound knowledge Or do Live your life how you want Im not your dad Just make sure you

m4cclb,THE,N/A,THE WEEK OF THE GME GAMMA,DD,20,0.83,Bevans2810,16,First time poster lifetime retard 22 GME 175 be Ive mulled over a couple of posts on gamma squeezes option chains and the moon landing date of 19 March 2021 so thought Id throw some of my own numbers around and check were all staying extra retarded Ive had a look at the call option chains for 12 March 21 19 March 21 and 26 March 21 and have ignored absolutely everything else Ape logic My conclusion is that this week the markets will not close at the same price they opened Undeniable At expiry 12 March 21 inthemoney ITM call options totalled 33485 the sum of open interest at strikes below 26450 On the assumption these ITM options are all exercised thats 335 million shares 62 of float 5417m being bought at GME market price of 26450 to fulfill the contracts totalling 8857m Ok If GME stays flat at 26450 until expiry of the 19 March 21 calls the number of ITM calls almost doubles to 59338 Exercise would mean 593 million shares 11 of float bought to fulfill totalling 157 BILLION Nice The GME open interest falls drastically with 26 March 21 calls with only 8867 ITM calls at the same GME price of 26450 A relatively tiny 887k shares totalling 2345m Boring In ape terms the above means I think were in for an exciting week If GME price stays flat and all calls expiring on 19 March 21 are exercised call writers must buy 11 of the float to fulfill the contracts This is a substantial figure especially when 100 of apes are not selling Maths Moreover the more shares that are bought to fulfill the exercised calls the greater the increase in price my extensive knowledge of economics allows me to define this as supply and demand therefore more calls become ITM and the process is rinsedandrepeated the Maya Jama squeeze But wait theres more Ive noted certain price points on the option chain that would lead to call writers being required to buy more than 05 of float Theres probably a fancy name for this but remember Im retarded Ive indicated this by STRIKE PRICE OF FLOAT below For the 12 March 21 calls price points included 200 08 250 05 300 17 350 06 400 11 500 12 600 05 and 800 67 The 17 at 300 could go some way to explaining the upward resistance we saw last week as holding 300 would have meant a total of 96 of float 14 billion would have been needed to be bought to fulfill all ITM calls GME not holding above 300 saved call option writers a minimum of 230m However for the 19 March 21 calls there are more price points and at lower prices These include 39 06 60 05 95 08 100 08 150 06 200 05 300 11 350 08 400 10 500 17 600 07 and 800 57 GME holdingsurpassing these prices over the next week should lead to bananas for all GME holding the following prices by the end of next week would lead to the following shares being bought by call writers to fulfill ITM options Price Shares of float cost 250 58m 108 154b 300 68m 126 180b 350 74m 138 197b 400 82m 151 217b 450 86m 159 227b 500 96m 178 255b To conclude I will be hodling Please note I am retarded and this is not financial advice Apes dont need advice I appreciate that solely analysing the call option chain is of very narrow scope with so many moving parts to consider but I am too retarded to consider much more If any fellow ape has comments improvements or corrections to make to the above then please do so Happy to share my retarded spreadsheet used to calculate the above if requested,2021-03-13,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4cclb/the_week_of_the_gme_gamma/

m4j5s5,None,N/A,How the United States government could benefit from meme stocks going to the moon,Discussion,20,0.89,fortifier22,21,DISCLAIMER NONE OF THIS IS FINANCIAL ADVISE OR 100 BASED ON FACTS THIS IS SIMPLY EDUCATIONAL AND THEORETICAL DISCUSSION TLDR Capital gains tax easing and even erasing debt financial stimulus to peoples all over the world a happier and more compliant population tax dodgers and those who screwed over the world in 2008 brought to justice in the only way that matters and a much needed stock market correction that could prevent a future disaster We all know that many meme stocks theoretically have the potential to explode through short and gamma squeezes and that will make many shareholders on the long side a lot of money However when looking at the bigger picture there is a lot that the government could gain from such events that can help them and the country in a long run Lets take a look at the aftermath of meme stocks mooning 1 Capital Gains Tax When people sell their meme stock shares after short squeezes occur governments will attain taxes off these investments Considering that millions of shares will be traded frequently for large sums of money that will bring some much needed stimulus to the economy This is especially considering how 40 of Americas money has been printed in the last year due to COVID19 Instead of raising taxes on the American people and having them pay more for their own money in the long run the capital gains taxes from these stocks can potentially make that unnecessary Also with more money gained from stocks many will likely reinvest some or even most of their money back into the stock market leading to even more capital gains taxes being reaped 2 People being more willing and able to spend further stimulating the economy and creating a happier population Its no surprise that when times are tougher economically people tend to spend less and save more Yet because this leads to governments reaping less taxes and businesses not being as profitable this makes economic times rougher which in turn Leads to a potentially endless economic recessiondepression Weve seen this in Japan in the late 1990s and early 2000s and they are currently at economic levels that are equal to their status in 1980 Theyve gone backwards in terms of their financial progression With the general population in possession of large sums of money however this allows the economy to be stimulated which not only benefits many people from nearly all classes but also creates a happier population overall Imagine it after a year of prolonged quarantine job loss future inflation and economic instability all while billionaires and institutions are playing the system and becoming even more rich for their own sakes Suddenly get served justice Then their money gets divided among those who took the most risks and played against them fought the fight to the end and helped make the world a better place This is practically the script to Endgame heck most actionheroic movies And the American people get to be a part of it Speaking of bad guys 3 The gains also wont be in the hands of large tax dodgers We all know that tax dodging is practiced by many especially those in large positions of power and wealth So is it truly wrong to reasonably assume that many big Wall Street players are dodging taxes For the US government this means that a lot of money that should and could be going towards erasing national debt fortifying infrastructure improving medical and educational institutions and many more benefits for Americans overall is instead being kept away for the sake of keeping rich individuals bank accounts filled with zeros With the money in the hands of the average citizen however the vast majority will not be able to commit tax fraud if at all on a massive level Of course they wont go out quietly when the squeezes happen yet that can still be a good thing because 4 The stock market needs a correction Many have been speculating that the stock market is not accurately reflecting the American economy and that a correction is inevitable When the squeezes happen for meme stocks however after the new DTCC rule comes into effect that will force hedge funds to liquidate much of their assets to cover their positions Theyll likely sell their other shares in massive volumes causing huge dips to occur in many stocks across the stock market Yet once the dust settles people can finally reassess the markets and determine where everything should be Stocks that deserve to be higher will be on huge discounts for many investors to get in on and allow them to go back up again while those that deserve to be down will likely stay down Then the economy can become stabilized again and everything can continue as it should Whether all of this is correct or not is beyond me and only based on the information I currently know Theres far more that could and could not happen based on ifwhen meme stocks

m4kam9,None,N/A,Theta God of Time and Death,Discussion,46,0.98,TheUltraViolence,144,I dont normally like these options for dummies kinds of posts and absolutely dont like seeing them but I keep seeing people try to make a stupid persons guide to how options work and being really irresponsible about explaining theta I have a few points I want to make about theta then hopefully we can put this to rest Im not going to talk about Delta or IV thats a different conversation and motherfuckers need to read Real quick Not a pro Not investment advice Advice about how you need to actually learn shit If youre too retarded to understand basic math or youre too lazy to try to actually better yourself then click the back button now For the retards that stick around Ill include pictures and a fun little story Okay about 3 of you should be left so lets dive in Theta The term theta refers to the rate of decline in the valuehttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsvvalueasp of an option due to the passage of time It can also be referred to as the time decayhttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsttimedecayasp of an option This means an option loses value as time moves closer to its maturityhttpswwwinvestopediacomtermsmmaturitydateasp as long as everything is held constant Theta is generally expressed as a negative number and can be thought of as the amount by which an options value declines every day Theta is an estimate of value decay Its a rate thats continuously adjusted Every second that passes makes your option worth less and less The biggest misconception is the one I want to focus on the most We talk about it it terms expressed in decay on a day I think for our simple brains but its not that simple just like days arent really exactly 24 hours and theres complex reasons why THETA IS NOT LINEAR You dickheads remember ymxb from middle school thats linear Heres theta on an option graphed for a 1yr contract ampx200B

option accelerates over time Look at that last little sliver of the chart See how sharp it goes down Thats FD range Thats when all the value of the option evaporates nearly instantly like your wifes interest in you when she met her boyfriend ampx200B httpswwwoptiontradingtipscomgreeksthetahtmlhttpspreviewredditbr6wnmc31wm61pngwidth713ampformatpngampautowebpamps63e4ca62032511a0b8e3ee2e43feed83b645def8 Theta will eat your lunch Last week I had a C250 FD on GME that I had to close on a loss even though it was ITM WHY Because the rate of decay on the option was so fast that GME wasnt rising fast enough to increase the value of the option and make up the difference Buying OTM and going ITM is good but its important to understand that even IF you are ITM it still wont save you from theta and sometimes its smarter to take profit rather than waiting You COULD even take the profit and buy the underlying RetardApe edition incase youre somehow still here You live in Loserville and want to move to TendieTown The distance is 1000 miles You have 1 work week to get there 5 days So first thing you realize is that you can travel 200 miles per day and youll get there on time Great Say you take Monday off Suddenly you need to travel 250 miles per day Not impossible but okay thats not a fun speed to move at Take note its a 25 increase Lets say again on the second day theres no movement Now you need to cover the same 1000 miles in 3 days Okay now youre looking at 3333 miles Thats a 3333 increase from the previous day Holy shit now you need to fucking move and move fast But lets say for one reason or another you Gary Michael Edward cant get out of bed on Wednesday Still have 1000 miles to travel Now you need to cover that distance in 2 days with an average velocity toward your goal at 500 miles per day Thats a 50 increase from the previous day And on the last day you need to do all 1000 which is a 100 increase from the previous day This is a gross over simplification but it at least gets point across Do you guys get it now Every day without progress makes the goal much more unlikely because the burden just shifts and grows exponentially to the remainder of time As the likelihood of the open hitting ITM increases and time passes theta acts as a decaying agent on the price bringing it into balance Please stop reading option tutorials from plumbers dog walkers high school teachers Please read about these concepts on actual investing websites and not the worlds Instagram of trading addiction or watch video from actual professional investors If someone tells you theyre not a pro are retarded think twice about letting them explain shit to you Read a book motherfucker FDs made this casino notorious because people who were here well before I was started posting crazy yolo FDs who knew how acidic theta was and still bought and occasionally made disgusting returns Good luck everyone I know all you are going to pump FDs with your stimmy so I guess just have fun and please try to learn how to

of two strategic transactions worth more than 500 million sending the stock to the fucking moon This is a deep value play but for all you short squeeze junkies AMRS does happen to have relatively significant short interest at 16 of the float I expect that the jump in price from AMRS‚Äôs upcoming transaction announcements to dump gasoline onto a raging fire sending the shorts to an early grave

investor in ENPH and after the success of that investment sub 2 share price in 2018 now trading above 150 a share I was looking to invest in a company with a similarly checkered past with a catalyst to turn the corner quickly As with ENPH the company needed to have invaluable technology with the potential for huge nearterm gains to compensate for the risk I couldn‚Äôt have been more elated discovering AMRS which checked all the boxes AMRS has performed well this year so far but we are lightyears away from the company‚Äôs potential both over the short and long term AMRS BUSINESS This business is complicated but I‚Äôll do my best to summarize some key points Founded by a group of Berkley scientists AMRS is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers manufactures and sells sustainably created ingredients and products into several markets including Health amp Wellness Clean Beauty and Flavor amp Fragrance Within Health amp Wellness AMRS focuses on alternative sweeteners vitamins and food ingredients In Flavor amp Fragrance AMRS produces natural oils and aroma chemicals for a range of applications In Clean Beauty AMRS focuses on clean skincare and cosmetic ingredients For all you tree huggers their production and products are totally sustainable and by creating otherwise naturally occurring molecules in the lab AMRS saves the destruction of animals and other natural resources as an example they produce a skincare molecule called squalene that otherwise requires killing sharks to get it AMRS generates revenue from a combination of a partnership model and a whollyowned direct model In the partnership model AMRS creates a moleculeingredient in the lab and scales it on a commercial level on behalf of a partner who then uses the moleculeingredient in one of its products which the partner markets and sells to its own customers AMRS captures revenues from producing and selling the moleculeingredient to the partner AMRS receives royalties from the partner‚Äôs product sales that contain the ingredient created by AMRS AMRS has many commercial industrial level partners including Firmenich Givaudan DSM Yifan the US Department of Energy and DARPA On the retail side AMRS has recently announced partnerships to create new brands such as JVNhttpsinvestorsamyriscom20210111AmyrisCreatesPartnershipWithJonathanVanNessToLaunchLeadingCleanHaircareBrand

sugar similar to Splenda as well as brands it has recently acquired such as Teresanahttpsinvestorsamyriscom20210122AmyrisAcquiringTerasanaBrandToOfferCleanCannabinoidConsumerProducts sustainably

is worth over 22 billion alone DoorDash Bloom Energy Quantamscape and of course Amyris AMRS where his investment is worth about 70000000 Doerr currently serves on the Board of Directors at Google and

SHORT INTEREST As shown in the below ownership statistics over 16 of AMRS‚Äôs tradable float is sold short which amounts to approximately 217 million shares as of 3262021 With a 90day average daily trading volume of just 49 million shares and just 23 million shares traded last Friday 326 I suspect that when the company delivers on its upcoming transactions this week trading volumes will increase from intense buying A rising share price will put tremendous pressure on short sellers to cover their positions leading to a classic short squeeze and an increased pop in the stock Source

began discussing a series of three upcoming strategic transactions that have truly changed the game for the company Each transaction is different but effectively involve the monetization of a moleculeingredient whereby a partner pays AMRS a significant upfront cash payment as well as licensing fees royalties over a multiyear period The significance of these transactions cannot be understated as they provide cash to the business while creating recurring revenue streams In effect these deals allow AMRS to selffund its business without diluting existing investors from new equity offerings or extremely expensive debt This is what the market has been craving The first of the three closed last December with a transaction value of just 50 millionhttpsinvestorsamyriscom20201221AmyrisCloses50MillionStrategicTransaction and the stock has flying ever since gaining over 200 so far this year The remaining two transactions are set to close within the next three days with an expected total value of over 500 million for JUST ONE OF THE TWO TRANSACTIONS Here is the CEO on the 4Q 2020 earnings call dated March 3 2021 4Q 2020 Earnings

the end of the first quarter several times thereafter including an industry conferences on 34 Cowen and 315 Roth as well as quietly in the last sentence of an unrelated press release on 325httpsinvestorsamyriscom20210325AmyrisDeliversRecordProductionOfCBGForConsumerSkincareFormulations To those that would argue it is already priced in you are wrong for several reasons First this company has almost no intuitional coverage and is paid very little attention relative to more established biotechnology companies Said differently the institutions that really set valuation and move the stock dont care enough yet to pay attention But they will AMRSs investor base only continues to expand as more people wake up to its incredible potential Second prior to the recent turnaround the company overpromised a few times just as companies that later mooned like ENPH did It happens particularly with early stage companies So even in the efficient market fantasy world the companys public disclosures would have a credibility discount leaving substantial upside for investors today when the company inevitably delivers CONCLUSION These strategic transactions will announce by no later than Thursday morning 41 and AMRS will be off to the fucking races For some context the suits at HC Wainwright and Roth Capital Partners currently have price targets of 33 and 35 I like the stock and I think it is worth even more The play AMRS shares April 16 calls with strikes 20 and above Good luck and

mk5h3m,None,N/A,The US Govt has a huge incentive to massively underreport inflation,Discussion,171,0.93,Natural_Profession_8,428,TLDR The US federal government has a massive incentive to underreport inflation A 1 underreporting of inflation saves the US govt between 500 billion and 1 trillion per year Its likely that such a huge moral hazard has led the government to systematically underreport inflation over the past few decades For background the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS calculates inflation It releases a measure known as the Consumer Price Index or CPI The formula used to calculate CPI is rather complex and opaque and has been changed numerous times over the years The effect of these changes has been to lower the average reported inflation number 1httpswwwinvestopediacomarticles07consumerpriceindexasp Many government revenues and expenditures are inflationlinked either directly or indirectly Directly linked 1 Social security payments Social security payments are linked to a measure known as CPIW very similar to the CPI 2httpswwwssagovoactCOLAcolasummaryhtml Every year the amount a social security recipient receives goes up in proportion to the amount of inflation It has been estimated that the social security program has total unfunded liabilities worth 37 trillion Every 1 of underreported inflation decreases the real value of these unfunded liabilities by 370 billion 2 Tax brackets Tax brackets are adjusted upwards to account for inflation 3httpswwwinvestopediacomaskanswers111715aretaxbracketsadjustedinflationasp This means when the government underreports inflation more people move up into higher tax brackets Its hard to calculate the exact effect of this on government revenues 3 Treasury InflationProtected Securities These are treasuries that increase the amount they pay back in both interest and principle according to inflation They are linked to the CPI These securities known as TIPS compromise 8 of the US federal debt 4httpswwwtreasurygovresourcecenterfinmktsPagestipsaspx This is 224 trillion Every 1 of underreported inflation decrease the real value of the principle of this debt by 22 billion There are also increases to the interest payments on this debt Indirectly linked 1 Debt interest payments Investors will demand higher returns from Treasuries in periods where they expect higher inflation The US government has 26 trillion in Treasury debt The yearly cost of servicing this debt is 12 of that roughly 378 billion in 2020 If investors were to expect higher inflation this yearly cost would go up by 260 billion for every 1 increase in expected inflation There are likely many other government programs that benefit from underreporting inflation these are just the main ones I could find When we add up all these policies we see that underreporting inflation by just 1 can save the government between 500 billion and 1 trillion a year This is 30 of the entire tax revenue of the US government Underreporting inflation by 34 a year would save the government more money than it brings in from taxes every year Evidence of underreporting There has probably never been a time in history when such a massive moral hazard existed and was not exploited Is there any evidence that the US government has in fact been understating inflation 1 Changes to the CPI formula Originally the CPI was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods In this case the CPI was a cost of goods index COGI However over time the US Congress embraced the view that the CPI should reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living1Ôªø Consequently the CPI has evolved into a cost of living index COLI Over the years the methodology used to calculate the CPI has undergone numerous revisions According to the¬†BLS the changes removed biases that caused the CPI to overstate the inflation rate The new methodology takes into account changes in the quality of goods and substitution Substitution the change in purchases by consumers in response to price changes changes the relative weighting of the goods in the basketÔªø The overall result tends to be a lower CPI However critics view the methodological changes and the switch from a¬†COGI¬†to a COLI as a purposeful manipulation that allows the¬†US¬†government to report a lower CPI 5httpswwwinvestopediacomarticles07consumerpriceindexasp Essentially the methodology used to calculate the CPI was changed to purposefully reduce the amount of inflation that is reported When a good is considered to be of increased quality its price increase is lowered to reflect this When the price of one good goes up its relative weighting in the CPI is reduced and another lowerpriced good is substituted for it 2 Rent In 2005 the average US rent was 755 In 2019 it was 1164 6httpswwwdeptofnumberscomrentus This is an increase of 54 or an average yearly increase of 31 During the same time the CPI has gone from 1916 to 2524 7httpsfredstlouisfedorgseriesCPIAUCSL which is only a 31 increase or an average yearly increase of 19 If we use rent as the true measure of inflation CPI has underreported inflation by 11 per year Keep in mind that during the period just mentioned the US experienced the most epic collapse in housing prices it had ever seen during the 20072008 crisis The housing bubble was already far along by 2005 8httpsfredstlouisfedorgseriesCSUSHPISA Nonetheless rent increases managed to outstrip the CPI What do you think Is the US government massively

mkal7x,A,N/A,The Uranium Bull Thesis Is Playing Out To Perfection A 500bn Market Is Emerging A MultiYear Run For The Equities Is Inevitable,DD,29,0.84,BooOnClay,69,With so many exciting developments of late I wanted to share my 02 on the current state of the uranium market focusing a bit on SWU which I am very fond of haha As always I look forward to any feedback As am sure all are aware we have seen a 15 jump in spot over last 2 weeks While the increase was in large part to nonproducing mines physical purchasing I noticed a number of discussions on Reddit and various Discord servers StockTwits also seeming to suggest that this uptick in spot U was indicative of where we are in the current fuel cycle Experienced investors in this sector will tell you however that this couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth Rather a more powerful indicator as to where we are in the cycle is by looking at the SWU enrichment price Based in large part on SWU projections many expert investors are forecasting a 500bn market For perspective during the last cycle the market peaked at 150bn So what is SWU For those very new to uranium investing a very quick overview might be helpful Also for those more familiar than I am I appreciate the feedback SWU short for Separative Work Unit is a measure for the cost of enrichment Generally speaking when SWU prices are low utilities benefit by purchasing excess enrichment inventory at cheap prices using intermediaries ie carry trades Conversely a rise in SWU signifies that the demand for enrichment is growing As excess inventories are utilized by end users the utilities no longer aided by the secondary market instead turn to the uranium producers to purchase future contracts at much higher prices It follows logically that higher enrichment prices force the utilities to retreat back into the fuel cycle from conversion UF6 and even fabricated fuel purchasing to the beginning ie spot U308 which in turn drives those spot prices up Additionally and perhaps most importantly higher SWU prices on future contracts are essential in incentivizing the mines to come back online McArthur and Cigar Lake for example need at least the 40s and for Paladin likely in the 50s in order to justify their operational costs Therefore SWU is arguably the best indicator of where we are in the fuel cycle Even when there are false startsspikes in the market which we‚Äôve seen in the past couple years SWU price is consistent What is the current SWU price SWU bottomed out at 34 in August 2018 after so much excess accumulated in the years following Fukushima Since hitting that low SWU has been on a relative straight line upwards currently estimated at 54 This steady growth over the past 25 years is one of if not the most compelling reason investors are so confident of a long bull market to come in this sector So how the is SWU forecasting a 500bn market Of course there are a number of things we can look at that are driving this thing Its becoming almost a daily occurrence now to see catalysts emerging ie breaking news this week on EU Green energy qualifications the White House endorsing nuclear in as part of the clean energy standard However moreso than anything SWU is at the core of the bull thesis which is that decarbonization of the electrical grid around the world is not possible without nuclear power Duke Energy Corp just said the same yesterday As SWU prices continue to rise it is inevitable that equity prices will follow Denison is a fun example Even now Im still amazed at how many people claiming to have thousands of shares of certain uranium producers are surprised when they hear that Denison isnt actually producing any uranium When utilities start executing term contracts with other producers at SWU in the 60s 70s 80s and beyond those mines will turn the lights back on The fact that they just bought spot above market is a pretty powerful indication of where things are headed as far as volume on these long term contracts It wont be long before Denison‚Äôs prices start to rise The same idea goes with Cominak Ranger etc Moreover what happens when weve exhausted Cigar Lake and Kazatomprom Or McArthur River It isnt just that we have a rising demand we need new projects coming into existence now in order to avoid a huge deficit in supply between 20252030 The investment opportunities on these projects are extremely exciting And why 500bn Frankly I think 500bn is conservative though something in this vicinity I have seen as the consensus among many experts Market cap for publicly traded uranium is at 125bn right now and this is only the very beginning Ultimately there are new players in the game with a ton of liquidity ie hedge funds and they are looking for value Taking URNM as one example the AUM just months ago when it IPOd was a few million Now AUM is 175mm We also cannot ignore what is happening in China It is a huge growth story there There is also a SPEC frenzy But again looking at the big picture moreso than anything else I keep going back to SWU For me it is the most powerful predictor of the multiyear bull run to come And while there will always be doubtful retail who to their credit have rightfully called false starts over the last couple years you cannot deny what 25 years of rising SWU enrichment prices means for where we are in the current cycle Again I would be very interested to hear where folks agreedisagree Any and all feedback is appreciated,2021-04-05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkal7x/the_uranium_bull_thesis_is_playing_out_to/
