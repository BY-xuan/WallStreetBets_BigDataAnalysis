# WallStreetBets Stock Research Posts Prediction

***

More than ever, stock trading has become democratized to retail investors. One of the most popular platforms for discussion is a subreddit called WallStreetBets. Unlike professional investors, retail investors have very limited time to conduct their own research as they usually have a separate career. In this project, we aim to further democratize stock trading by using prediction and filtering on research so that every regular investor has the opportunity to quickly access quality information and analysis.

The dataset we will use are the reddit posts categorized as “DD” (Due Diligence), which are stock research on WallStreetBets. We will collect this data by using the Reddit API and use classification to separate the serious research posts from the meme posts by tokenizing the content with Bag-of-words method and by applying Naive-Bayes method. We will then check the stock growth of a stock corresponding to a given serious post repeatedly, in a given time interval, and use this data to make a prediction on future research posts of this subreddit.
